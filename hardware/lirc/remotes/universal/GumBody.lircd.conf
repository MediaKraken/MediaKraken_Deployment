# brand:                                   meliconi
# model name of remote control:            GumBody
# devices being controlled by this remote: TVs and VCRs
#
# Note: this is a universal remote. This file will work if you program
#       your remote with code 101 for the TV and 772 for the VCR.
#       This is a nice combination because these codes yield the same protocol
#       for both the TV buttons and the VCR buttons, therefore you need only
#       one "begin remote..end remote" section in your config file to handle
#       all buttons of your remote.
#
#       When you buy the remote, there is a rectangular block of 4×3
#       (cols × lines) buttons with no names on them and you have a set of
#       masks that you can stick around the buttons to associate a
#       drawing/inscription to each one of them. I chose the mask that gave me
#       the most obvious drawing/inscription -> button name mapping where
#       "button name" is the name used with lircd for this button.
#       Anyway, even if you don't have the same mask, here is how to identify
#       them: they are listed below as (order is important) txt..color+ (12
#       buttons) and s100..contrast+ (again 12 buttons). The first block
#       corresponds to the buttons taken left to right, then top to bottom;
#       the second block is the same except that the SHIFT button of the
#       remote must be held down while the button of the 4×3 block is pressed.
