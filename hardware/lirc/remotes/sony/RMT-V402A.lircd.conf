#
# Notes:
# This remote came bundled with a Sony VCR model SLV-N750.  It has a switch
# on it that switches the remote between VCR and television operation
# (labeled TV/VIDEO).  The two modes of operation are listed as seperate
# remotes in this configuration file because several buttons (notably the
# numerals) produce different codes depending on the remote's mode.  The
# VCR's transport control buttons, for example PLAY, FF, etc., produce
# longer codes than the buttons on the rest of the remote, and so these too
# must be listed as a seperate remote which I have called the "SHUTTLE"
# functions.
#
# I have discovered that the VCR which this remote controls also responds
# to STOP, REW, etc., commands other than those produced by the remote.
# The universal remote that came with my satellite TV receiver produces
# "Sony" VCR codes different from those of my remote but which my VCR,
# nevertheless, responds to.  I have added these codes to this remote file,
# even though the remote doesn't produce them.  The idea here is to enable
# one to control the matching VCR by sending them, or to allow the computer
# to respond to universal remotes programmed for the VCR.  These extra
# codes match the format of the "VIDEO" codes below, so that's where they
# are listed.
#
# So to be clear:  the remote's buttons generate the codes in the "TV", and
# "SHUTTLE" lists below, and all the buttons in the "VIDEO" list excluding
# the "extra" codes;  the VCR responds to none of the "TV" codes, but all
# of the codes in the "SHUTTLE" and "VIDEO" lists including the extra
# codes.
