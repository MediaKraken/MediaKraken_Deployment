# brand:             SONY
# model:             RMT-136
# supported devices: Remote control included with a 1985 Super Betamax
#                    consumer video recorder model SL-100 (non-HiFi,
#                    no composite in -- coax in only)
#
# notes: This remote seems to have a particularly strong IR LED -- it
#        works when pointed almost directly away from the receiver
#        (Radio Shack IR module) while another remote I have requires
#        that it be pointed directly at the receiver from a distance of
#        2m at the most.  When pointed directly at the receiver, it
#        works from at least 15m away (the size of the room).  Sony
#        definitely made good remotes back then!
