# brand:             Hampton Bay
# model:             UC7078T
# supported devices: Ceiling fan. Requires 303.875MHz RF transmitter
#
# Other Hampton Bay fans have similar remotes, but have no "Up Light",
# and the remote has a "Fan Forward/Reverse" button. I suspect these
# remotes would use the same codes, at least for the buttons that are
# common.
#
# The remotes use a Tiro wireless encoder/decoder set. I know the
# encoder is the M1E, but haven't cracked open the receiver to check
# the decoder. The datasheet for the M1D-95 has the pinout of the M1E,
# but that particular decoder is for a remote doorbell application.
# It can be found at
# http://www.tiro.cc/datasheet/doorbell/M1D-95.pdf
# I believe the decoder that is used has fewer address bits (they must
# be matched for outputs to be driven) and more data bits, since I am
# seeing 5 data bits driven, but the datasheet only shows 4.
#
# I looked up the FCC id on the back of the remote (CHQ8BT7078T) to
# determine the frequency of the remote (303.875MHz) at
# http://www.fcc.gov/oet/fccid/
# and ordered the transmitter from Computronics in Australia
