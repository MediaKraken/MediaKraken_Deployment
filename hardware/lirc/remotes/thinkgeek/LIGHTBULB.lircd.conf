# brand: ???
# model no. of remote control: ???
# devices being controlled by this remote: A lightbulb from Thinkgeek.com
# Another one like it can be found http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/lights/831e/
#
# Note: I also have a Haier air conditioner, and it's "Power" button happens
#       to correspond to the W button on this remote. I haven't configured
#	the Haier remote yet.
#
# Naming Scheme
# ==============
# Because most of the buttons on this remote are colored, and not named, and
# because I don't want to confuse anyone by calling these "blue 1" and "blue 2",
# I decided instead to number the unnammed ones according to the column they are in.
# The column is named by the letter in the button right above it (R, G, B, or W), and
# the number is the row, starting from that row with the letters, down to R5...W5.
# I'm using the same name as the buttons with names for any button with names.
