# Config file for Packard Bell Remotes (with repeat codes!)
# created by Samuel Wood (sjw@umr.edu)
#
# brand:             Packard Bell Remote
# model:             El Cheapo Packard Bell Remote
#
# This is a config file for the cheap excess Packard Bell remotes
# you sometimes can buy from online auctions like www.onsale.com.
#
# The receiver that comes with it hooks into the serial port and works
# fine with lirc 0.5.4.
#
# The receiver that comes with the remote is near garbage. If
# you don't point almost directly at it, it will not detect. But
# it's simpler than building your own. :-)
#
# Repeat works fine for me. You just have to modify or add the
# "repeat=" lines in your .lircrc.
#
# irrecord was used to generate the file, then I modified and
# added repeat codes.
#
# The button names used are identical to what was printed on the
# remote, except for the number pads (using actual numbers like
# "1" and so forth did not seem to work. Similarly, '*' is Star
# and '#' is Hash. LMB and RMB refer to the two mousepad buttons
# on the left and right respectively.
#
# I still need to modify the gap setting. Right now, if you don't
# hold the button down long enough, it may not register, but if
# you hold it too long, it will detect a repeat or two. Feel free
# to modify this to work better. If you get it to work better, send
# me a copy. :-)
