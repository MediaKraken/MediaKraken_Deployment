# brand: SupportPlus7 Universal 7in1
# model no. of remote control: 7
# TV mode programmed to Marantz (436)
# devices being controlled by this remote: universal
# IR receiver: Hauppauge WinTV

# Porgramming of TV mode: Hold down TV until the red light on the top
# flashes twice, this takes about 5 seconds. Then enter 436. After
# successfull programming the red light flashes twice. If it flashes
# just once something went wrong!
# I was not able to get the keys TV VCR SAT AUD CD/DVD TAPE TUNER and
# SHIFT to do something useful together with the hauppauge IR
# receiver. So I just set up different modes for different functions
# (TV, CD...) in ~/.lircrc, and switch modes with six of the 8 keys at
# the bottom which I labelled: TXT TV I M RADIO TV/SAT.
