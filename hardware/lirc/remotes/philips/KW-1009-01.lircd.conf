# Notes:
# This is an IR keyboard using the 12-bit version of the Philips RC-MM
# protocol.  The first 2 bits are the mode, followed by 2 address bits.
# This keyboard generates "keyboard" mode (10) codes for keyboard and mouse
# buttons, and "mouse" mode (01) codes for the mouse thingy.  The
# keyboard's address bits are 00.  I have combined the mode and address
# bits into a 4-bit pre_data thingy for LIRC.  Each key has a "_DN" version
# and an "_UP" version for the codes generated when the key is pressed, and
# released respectively.  The names have been chosen to match those printed
# by xmodmap.
#
# For the mouse pad, the 8 bits of data are divided up as follows.  The low
# 4 bits encode the direction in which the wheel is being pressed, by
# indicating the angle as measured in the standard sense (0 to the right,
# increasing counter clockwise).  The high 4 bits encode the magnitude of
# the press.  I have not bothered entering codes for the mouse, because
# LIRC isn't really the right way to handle this.
#
# Official timings from Philips documentation (microseconds):
#	header	417	278
#	zero	167	278
#	one	167	444
#	two	167	611
#	three	167	778
#	ptrail	167
#
# The timings below were obtained by collecting a great number of
# statistics, and allow me to use the keyboard with it aimed at the
# computer *and* while sitting facing away from the computer bouncing the
# light off a wall.
