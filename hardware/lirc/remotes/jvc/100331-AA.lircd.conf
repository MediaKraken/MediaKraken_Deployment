# Config file for JVC Dish Network/Web Tv Remotes
# Created by John Schauer <schauer@bigfoot.com> with the help of
# Christoph Bartelmus
#
# brand:  JVC
# model:  100331-AA
#
#
# This is a universal remote control sold with Dish Networks model
# 7222 satellite receiver.  (also known as a Dish Player 500 system)
#
# The remote has a switch on the right side to select between Sat or
# Tv/VCR.  All the codes gathered below were captured with lircd in
# debug mode (irrecord would not recognize them).  However, the Tv/VCR
# buttons seem to work just fine with irrecord (this may vary depending
# on what you program for your tv/vcr)
#
# It's a weird remote but it works with lircd 0.6.2.
#
# The satellite receiver also supports an optional IR keyboard.  If anyone
# has this please upload a config for it.  I want to be able to transmit
# text from my computer to the receiver (for tv listing searches).
