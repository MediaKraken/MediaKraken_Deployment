 THE FOLLOWING BUGS ARE NOT LISTED IN THE MAMEINFO.DAT

 "Amiga" (ID 03875): Most/all sets running on Amiga hardware: Visible area one pixel narrower than intended. absence
 "Artwork" (ID 03459): Any set with clickable artwork: Need to not hide cursor during full screen for games that have "clickable" artwork elements. Mr. Do
 "Artwork" (ID 05628): Cannot make screenshot of alternate artwork. haynor666

 "BIOS" (ID 03612): Duplicated bios names are possible. Firewave
 "Brightness/Contrast/Gamma" (ID 01625): Possible to add settings to the "~" menu to have Brightness, Contrast, and Gamma settings for artwork? This kind of request comes up every so often (why can we adjust the game screen but not artwork, artwork "too bright," etc.). Mr. Do
 "cfg/ini" (ID 06068): CFG/INI confusion: Core screen settings that are changed with sliders are saved in the .cfg file and this creates a conflict with .ini file. u-man
 "CHD" (ID 04700): CD-TEXT is not stored in CHD. Firewave
 "CHDMAN" (ID 04709): Random deadlocks. Firewave
 "CHDMAN" (ID 05079): addmeta and delmeta commands does not work as intended. "file not writeable". KingTut
 "CHDMAN" (ID 05891): ThreadSanitizer: data race. Firewave
 "Compiling" (ID 05640): Build failed: Array subscript is above array bounds. gauel
 "ctrlr files" (ID 01080): The \ctrl files should override driver specific mappings. For example: djmain.c, asteroid.c, invaders.c, and missile command. If you have these mapped differently at the driver level [*.c] in a \ctrlr\*.cfg file or as individual games in the \ctrlr file the settings do *not* take. It is necessary to remap the games manually in-game via [TAB]. If you have a \ctrlr file it should take precedence over the internally hard-coded 'fresh' defaults. John IV

 "IMGTOOL" (ID 06576): imgtool multiple problems. Robbbert
 "INI" (ID 02604): Option to "Create .INI" in minimal UI. A worthwhile addition would be to allow a "CREATE NEW MAME.INI" option when presented with the game selection/minimal UI screen. There are some who absolutely cannot fathom any command-line integration - this would assist those who would otherwise get frustrated and still do know to edit a text file from notepad.

 "mngwrite (ID 03437): -mngwrite does not allow absolute path. Tafoid
 "Mouse" (ID 02253): Given the addition of mouse controls to the MAME menus - I noticed that the Slider doesn't take advantage of this new development. An ability to adjust the Slider bar value with a mouse click would be a great addition and would silence those who believe the current adjustment implementation (with arrows keys) is too slow. Tafoid
 "Multiple resolutions" (ID 05648): Games with multiple resolutions: When a game switches resolution, the screen gets cut off in -aviwrite mode. ScHlAuChi
 "Multiple resolutions" (ID 05649): Any games with multiple resolutions: Extended -snapsize functions (No scale / Nearest neighbor). ScHlAuChi

 "Multiscreen+pause" (ID 00193): When you pause mame, the screen is normally darkened. However this is only the case for screen 0. I have 3 screens and screen 1 and 2 are not darkened. This might be intentionally offcourse, but I think it's just something that was looked over. my setup is: screen 0 ATI, screen 1 ATI (same card as 0) and screen 2 NVIDIA.

 "YM2203 SSG-EG" (ID 01066): Seems to be emulation of YM2203 feature 'SSG-EG' has inaccuracy in MAME. We (I as programmer and some other people as hardware developers) construct some sort of sound card which uses YM2203, and I wrote software for it. For testing purposes I use some of source code from MAME, related to YM2203 emulation (to make fast tests on PC, instead of real thing). Now listen to two attached samples - which contains short part of music and then all possible SSG-ENV types in one channel. One of these samples recorded from real thing, YM2203 @3.5 MHz, and another rendered by YM2203 emulation code from MAME. Comments in fm.c code said: The difference (when compared to normal Envelope Generator mode) is that the resolution in Decay and Sustain phases is 4 times lower; this results in only 256 steps instead of normal 1024. But seems to resolution in SSG-EG mode 8 times lower, not 4. I checked that by changing adding value from 4 to 8 in strings 1147 and 1170 of fm.c, and it sounds more like true. But there still some differences with envelope stages, by now I can't figure it clearly (you can see this in samples with any audio editor). I also can provide test register array (in simply format, .GYM-like), which was used to record these samples. ym2203ssg-eg0111u4ora Shiru
 "Z80" (ID 05985): Z80 CPU core can't handle many IX/IY (0xdd/0xfd) instruction prefixes in a row. MetalliC

             released for Namco's System 21, System 22, and Super System 22 harware. The focus to date has
             been on Prop Cycle and Starblade, though other titles work to various extents and bug reports are welcome.
             Primry purpose is to provide a framework for experimenting with rendering abstractions that provide
             a bridge between traditional arcade video hardware and modern APIs like OpenGL and Direct3d.
             Secondary purpose is to explore the benefits of targeted patches and recompilation techniques
             to eliminate performance bottlenecks.

  RAINE    : Raine is the fastest emulator, it emulates many M68000 and M68020 arcade games
             and is mainly focused on Taito and Jaleco games hardware. It started as an experiment
             with the Rainbow Islands romset, dumped by Aracorn/Romlist. Raine can emulate
             many nice games now, and new games (previously unemulated) are appearing weekly.
             Sound is also getting better, mainly thanks to the work of Hiromitsu Shioya.
             Emulating cpu's and sound chips takes quite a lot of coding time, so, like most
             of the current emulators, Raine uses emulation engines already available when

  Retrocade: Retrocade emulates a large number (114) of classic arcade games from the late
             1970's and the 1980's. Retrocade offers advanced emulation performance by
             utilizing 100% assembly language CPU emulators in both the DOS and
             Windows 32-bit versions, as well as highly optimized display code
             (supports linear frame buffer access via VESA 2.0, as well as dirty buffering).
             Full sound support is offered as well both through sound-chip emulation and the
             use of high quality (16-bit @ 44.1 KHz) samples and sample-playing techniques
             (real-time mixing of samples with other samples as well as emulated sound).


  Shark    : Shark is an arcade game emulator for the Win95/98 operating system.
             The games are mainly TOAPLAN arcade games up to 1992, plus a couple of TAITO
             games from 1986.


  Sparcade : Sparcade is a multi-game arcade emulator with support for games based around
             the 6502, 6809, Z80, 8086 or 68000 processors. Unlike many other emulators,
             Sparcade's core is 100% assembly language, providing true arcade speed and
             smoothness even on low-specced machines.


  Supermodel: Supermodel was written by Bart Trzynadlowski. It is based on the original
              Supermodel effort by Ville Linde, Stefano Teso, and me from 2003.
              The present code is all-new except for the PowerPC emulator, which was written
              by Ville Linde. Development began in January 2011.
              Sega Model 3 emulator at http://www.trzy.org/Supermodel


  System16 : System16 emulates the Sega System 16 arcade board used by many Sega arcade games
             from 1987 to 1989, like Shinobi, Altered Beast and E-Swat. There are over 20
             existing System 16 games. The System 16 board uses a Motorola 68000 for the
             main program, a Z80 and the "YM2151/3012" couple for sound. The emulator itself
             emulates much more than 'just' the System 16 board, because now you can play
             System 18 games like Shadow Dancer, even those with dual 68000 processors like
             Hang-On, Space Harrier and Out Run !!


  SystemC2 : The Sega System C2 was an arcade board based on Genesis hardware, but like other
             arcade machines based on consoles, has improved parts and speeds. Games for it
             include the likes of: "Bloxeed", "Columns", "Puyo Puyo", "Thunder Force AC" among
             others.


  Tickle   : Tickle has an object-oriented architecture and provides several useful "stock"
             objects and functions for developing drivers, including for example bitmap
             manipulation, digitized sample loading and playback, input and output streams.
             In addition to these, there are also several objects that provide emulation of
             CPUs (8080, Z80), sound chips (AY-3-8910, Namco 3-channel WSG, SN76477) and more
             (waveform generation, LM555 oscillator, RC filters). As of version 0.92 a new
             library called ASE (for Analog Sound Emulation) contains several components that
             are specifically designed to help emulating the analog sound circuits found in
             many old games.


  U64Emu   : U64Emu emulates the hardware that Killer Instinct, Killer Instinct 2, and other
             games run on.

The current version is 0.53 because 0.36 (the last "non-beta" release) + .16 (the number of "beta" releases since then) = 0.52. The Windows port is now called "MAME" (instead of "MAMEW"). The DOS port is called "DMAME".
