0.    MAME CPU Interface

- 0.188              : Renamed AS_DECRYPTED_OPCODES to AS_OPCODES [O. Galibert].
- 0.180              : Removed emu\drivers\emudummy.cpp.
- 0.179              : Make sure all CPU's export STATE_GENPCBASE and use safe_pcbase() for everything in the debugger, which allows interruptible CPU's to work properly. Changed CPU cores pcbase handling to be consistent with the majority of CPU cores, now that the debugger relies on it [smf].
- 0.177              : Store address of elemtnt 0 of m_table and return it in vtlb_table, with this in debug mode i386 is 1.7 times faster (emu\divtlb.cpp) [yz70s]. Fixed TARGET=virtual (scripts\target\mame\virtual.lua) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.171              : Changed devices\cpu\vtlb.cpp/h to emu\divtlb.cpp/h. Make generic VTLB implementation a modern device interface [AJR].
- 0.166              : Changed GAME_NO_SOUND to MACHINE_NO_SOUND in emu\drivers\emudummy.c [Kyungdahm Yun].
- 0.155              : Sync'd CPU list (mame\mame.mak and mess.mak) [Oliver Stöneberg]. Removed legacy_cpu_device (emu\devcpu.c/h) [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.154              : Removed DECLARE_LEGACY_CPU_DEVICE (emu\devcpu.h) [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.153              : Enable all cpu cores in MAME (SCORE and 8X300 CPU). Getting rid of some references to legacy_cpu_device (video\epic12.c, drivers\chihiro.c and cv1k.c) [Wilbert Pol]. Replaced machine().firstcpu with m_maincpu (cpu\psx\rcnt.c, sound\disc_inp.c, drivers\chihiro.c. limenko.c. m90.c. midqslvr.c. peplus.c., policetr.c, seattle.c, skydiver.c, splus.c, sprint2.c, machine\balsente.c, galaxold.c and video\system1.c). Replaced some calls to machine().firstcpu->pcbase() with machine().describe_context() (machine\mc6843.c, mc6846.c, mc6854.c and mos6530.c) [smf].
- 0.150              : Added MCFG_{CPU|DEVICE}_VBLANK_INT_REMOVE and MCFG_{CPU|DEVICE}_PERIODIC_INT_REMOVE to properly remove non-legacy VBLANK interrupts - the current code only reset the legacy interrupt which wasn't set anyways (emu\devcpu.h, diexec.c/h, drivers\dacholer.c, segas18.c and system1.c). Removed unused legacy VBLANK interrupt code (emu\devcpu.h, diexec.c/h). Removed some unused device_irq_acknowledge_callback occurrances (cpu\arm7\arm7.h, arm7core.h, hcd62121\hcd62121.c, tms32031\tms32031.c/h and tms32051.c). Removed unused periodic interrupt legacy code (emu\devcpu.h and diexec.c/h) [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.149u1            : Added missing cpu metadata (cpu\cpu.mak). Made makemak create lst as well, and some fixes for cpu.mak [Miodrag Milanovic]. legacy_cpu--: This is a first pass at converting to a modern device, I'd be surprised if there are no issue but it's already a weeks worth of updating + testing [David Haywood].
- 0.148u4            : Moved cpu_device * to required_device in existing driver state classes. Added m_maincpu where missing in driver classes that are placed in drivers (m_maincpu(*this, "maincpu") { } + required_device<cpu_device> m_maincpu;). Changed machine().device("maincpu") with m_maincpu in MAME tree part. Changed machine().device("audiocpu") with m_maincpu. Make slot depended checks to be case insensitive like other parts of core (emu\mconfig.c). Various cpu lookup cleanup [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.148u2            : Changed CPU_DISASSEMBLE to use cpu_device * instead of legacy_cpu_device *, so that class based cpu devices can also be passed (emu\devcpu.h). Pass this instead of NULL and options instead of 0 in the class based cpu cores (cpu\adsp2100\adsp2100.c, asap\asap.c, avr8\avr8.c, cosmac\cosmac.c, dsp16\dsp16.c, dsp32\dsp32.c, hd61700\hd61700.c, i8008\i8008.c, lr35902\lr35902.c, m6809\hd6309.c, m6809\konami.c, mips\r3000.c, sm8500\sm8500.c, tms32031\tms32031.c and upd7725\upd7725.c) [smf].
- 0.148u1            : Added direct dynamic entry load to virtual TLB (cpu\vtlb.c). vtlb_fill doesn't appear to provide an easy way to determine whether a failure is due to a presence or permission error also entries need to be marked dirty or the performance improvement is minimal [Carl].
- 0.147u3            : Allow overriding TMSMAKE/M68KMAKE (ifndef...endif) for easier cross-compilation and testing of alternatives (emu\cpu\cpu.mak) [Robert Muth].
- 0.147              : Added safe_pc() and safe_pcbase() methods to device_t. Convert all cpu_get_pc() to safe_pc() and cpu_getpreviouspc() to safe_basepc(). Removed the old macros. Don't use safe_pc[base] when you already have a resolved device_state_interface. Added redundant methods to device_state_interface to generate errors when this is done. In device_state_interface, rename state() to state_int() and set_state() to set_state_int() for consistency. Update all callers. Also add set_pc() helper and updated all callers to use that instead of set_state_int(STATE_GENPC). Added device_t::state() method to get the state interface. Added redundant device_state_interface::state() method to catch redundant use of it. Removed cpu_get_reg() and cpu_set_reg() macros in favor of using the above methods. Closeout on old macros. Retired cputag_set_input_line and cputag_set_input_line_and_vector, replacing them with machine.device("tag")->execute().set_input_line[_and_vector]. More AM_BASE_LEGACY removal [Aaron Giles].
- 0.146u5            : Made MCFG_QUANTUM_PERFECT_CPU able to work within devices (emu\mconfig.c ) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.144u6            : Added emu\drivers\testcpu.c. Created new testcpu driver that shows how to develop an empty test driver that (ab)uses the core to single step a CPU executing arbitrary instructions and capturing before/after state and tracking memory. Currently this driver is always compiled, but is not referenced in mame.lst [Aaron Giles].
- 0.142              : Aaron Giles removed redundant item cpu from address_space, in favor of space->device().
- 0.141u2            : Curt Coder added all CPU and sound devices in emu folder to the MAME build. Removed cpuexec_describe_context, cpuexec_boost_interleave, cpuexec_trigger, and cpuexec_triggertime in favor of calls to the scheduler [Aaron Giles].
- 0.140u3            : Aaron Giles added DEVICE_SELF_OWNER which allows an address map to refer to the owner of its owning device. Useful for CPU address map handlers for CPU's that are part of a device.
- 0.140              : Added emu\drivers\emudummy.c. Dummy driver file that references CPU devices which are in turn referenced by devices in libemu.a. The reason we need this is due to link ordering issues with GCC if the actual drivers being linked don't reference these CPU devices. Since we link libcpu first, if libemu needs stuff from libcpu that wasn't previously referenced, it will fail the link.
- 0.139u1            : More API cleanup [Aaron Giles]: Removed cputag_clocks_to_attotime() and cputag_attotime_to_clocks() in favor of just expanding the class. Same for cputag_suspend() and cputag_resume().
- 0.138u3            : Aaron Giles removed the following functions: cpu_get_total_cycles()   == cpudevice->total_cycles(), cpu_clocks_to_attotime() == cpudevice->cycles_to_attotime() and cpu_attotime_to_clocks() == cpudevice->attotime_to_cycles(). Aaron Giles removed most other instances of cpu_get_total_cycles. Aaron Giles removed cpu_get_sp(). Aaron Giles added cycles_to_attotime() and attotime_to_cycles() which is more often what is requested (clocks are the raw input clock, while cycles are internal clock after dividers/multipliers). Aaron Giles created CPU-specific device types for all CPUs, using new macros DECLARE_LEGACY_CPU_DEVICE and DEFINE_LEGACY_CPU_DEVICE. Changed CPUs to be their own device types, rather than all of type CPU with a special internal subtype. Note that as part of this process I removed the CPU_ prefix from the ALL-CAPS device name, so CPU_Z80 is just plain old Z80 now. This required changing a couple of names like 8080 to I8080 so that there was an alphabetic first character. Got rid of cpu_count, cpu_first, cpu_next, etc. as they were badly broken. Also removed cpu_is_executing, cpu_is_suspended, cpu_get_local_time, and cpu_abort_timeslice [Aaron Giles].
- 0.138u2            : Added emu\devcpu.c/h. Removed emu\cpuexec.c/h and cpuintrf.h. Converted the classic CPU device to a standard device that uses the execution, state, memory and disassembly interfaces. Used this new class (cpu_device) to implement the existing CPU device interface. In the future it will be possible to convert each CPU core to its own device type, but for now they are still all CPU devices with a cpu_type() that specifies exactly which kind of CPU [Aaron Giles]. Changed the way CPU state tables are built up. Previously, these were data structures defined by a CPU core which described all the registers and how to output them. This functionality is now part of the state interface and is implemented via the device_state_entry class. Updated all CPU cores which were using the old data structure to use the new form. The syntax is currently awkward, but will be cleaner for CPUs that are native new devices [Aaron Giles]. Removed MDRV_CPU_FLAGS() which was only used for disabling a CPU. Changed it to MDRV_DEVICE_DISABLE() instead. Updated drivers [Aaron Giles].
- 0.136u1            : Fabio Priuli replaced all occurrences of cputag_get_cpu with devtag_get_device: the former function was just an alias and now cpus are no different from other devices. Also removed cputag_get_cpu and cputag_reset (another alias, not even used in the source) from cpuexec.h.
- 0.135u1            : Curt Coder allowed child CPUs to be used in read8/write8 callbacks.
- 0.134u4            : Dirk Best changed device callback system to look up devices owned by the same parent if a child device references another device.
- 0.134u3            : Removed osd\osdmini\osd_cpu.h and osd\windows\osd_cpu.h.
- 0.134              : Aaron Giles removed remaining references to machine->cpu[n]. Removed cpu[n] array. Replaced with machine->firstcpu which is a fast access to the head of the list of CPUs.
- 0.131u4            : Fabio Priuli replaced almost all remaining cpu[num] occurrences in src\mame\ with tags.
- 0.131u3            : CPUs actually take some time to reset. Changed the 68000/68010 to eat an appropriate number of cycles after a reset [Aaron Giles].
- 0.131u1            : Replaced the use of CPU numbers with tags where possible across most drivers [Fabio Priuli]. Deprecated device_set_info. Almost all devices had a NULL or empty function here. Remaining devices have been converted to have device-specific functions to do the same thing with proper type checking. CPUs still have a set_info function but it is CPU-specific now and no longer piggybacks on the general device function [Aaron Giles].
- 0.130u4            : Fabio Priuli fixed CPU_GET_INFO issues spotted by -validate in MESS debug build.
- 0.130u2            : CPU cores are now enabled on a per CPU core family basis instead of per CPU core variant. As a result CPUDEFS is no longer needed in the makefile [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.130u1            : Aaron Giles changed the CPU cores to use the get_safe_token() pattern like other devices.
- 0.129u4            : Aaron Giles fixed disassembler for CPUs with address bus shifts. Nathan Woods added the ability to invoke CPU input lines with DEVCB callbacks.
- 0.129u1            : Removed several useless occurrences of "#define INLINE" in CPU and sound cores [Dirk Best]. Made direct (opcode) access more robust. Direct access now crawls the memory table to find its ranges, and caches them for fast access in the future. It invalidates intersecting regions when new ones are installed, and now properly handles mirrored ranges [Aaron Giles].
- 0.129              : Removed emu\cpuintrf.c. Significantly optimized the inner execution loop [Aaron Giles]. Arkanoid 2 is ~2.5x faster with maximum interleave now. CPU interface organization shuffle. The file cpuintrf.h now merely describes the interface, but does not contain any implementation. All remaining bits of implementation have been migrated either to cpuexec.c or to debugcpu.c. Specifically, cpu_dasm() is now debug_cpu_disassemble(), and cpu_set_dasm_override() is now debug_cpu_set_dasm_override(). Also moved memory_address_physical() to debug_cpu_translate(), since it was only ever used for debugging [Aaron Giles]. Aaron Giles changed all CPU and sound cores to use memory_find_address_space() instead of cpu_get_address_space(). The former is reliable even during early initialization when the CPU cores generally need it. Aaron Giles removed the dummy CPU core and cpuintrf.c. Aaron Giles changed the core execution loop to directly call the execute function instead of using the inline helper (which has been removed). Aaron Giles normalized the CPU cores to always do while (icount > 0), in order to remove the kludge in cpuexec.c that caused us to overeat by 1 cycle to accommodate those cores that there looping while (icount >= 0). Aaron Giles cleaned up the profiler. Reduced its runtime overhead significantly by inlining the check to see if it is running. Removed obsolete entries and updated the text to more accurately describe each one. Added CPU tags to the CPU names. Switched to using an astring for building the final string. Unfortunately, still a bit too much overhead to leave it on in all builds.
- 0.128u7            : Made CPUs into proper devices. CPUs are now added in the machine configuration just as any other device, and the standard CPU configuration is performed via the inline configuration macros [Aaron Giles]. Aaron Giles and Atari Ace changed cpu_type from an enumeration into a pointer to the CPU's get_info function, very similar to device behavior. Updated all drivers to #include the necessary header files for the CPU's they reference. Aaron Giles added function cpu_get_type() to return the CPU type. Aaron Giles changed several cpu_* functions over to the device_* equivalents, specifically for get/set info and for reset. Aaron Giles cleaned up code that looped over CPUs via the machine->cpu array to now loop using the type-based device list. Aaron Giles cleaned up the generic interrupt_enable code to work with CPU devices instead of numbers. Aaron Giles removed cpuintrf_init() which is no longer necessary. Aaron Giles defined a generic device execute function callback, though it is not used yet. The long term plan is that any device with an execute callback will be scheduled along with the CPUs. Now that CPUs are devices, their scheduling will be moved over to this logic eventually. Aaron Giles moved device startup to *before* the DRIVER_INIT is called. This is to allow the DRIVER_INIT to configure devices that have been properly allocated. So far I don't see any negative effects, but be on the lookout if something weird shows up. Aaron Giles rewrote the device iteration logic to make use of the typenext field and the newly-introduced classnext field for iterating more efficiently through devices of a given type or class. Aaron Giles cleaned up many other CPU headers to move memory read/write macros out of them, since they are inappropriate and should be prive to the CPU core. Aaron Giles added the concept of a cpu_state_table, which is supplied by the CPU cores and which describes all the register state accessible to the debugger and other subsystems. The format of the table is such that most data can be simply fetched from memory without the further involvement of the CPU core, including the display of common formats. Extensibility points are available for custom display and for importing/exporting the data to intermediate variables for more complicated scenarios. Updated the ADSP21xx, TMS340x0, i86, Z80, Z180 and 8085 cores to use this. More cleanup [Aaron Giles]: Added address-space-specific constants for the various bus width and shift CPU interface constants. Changed all the cores to use them. Aaron Giles added new MDRV_QUANTUM_PERFECT_CPU(x) to specify that the minimum quantum should be enough to ensure that the specified CPU tag only ever executes a single instruction at a time. This can be used to explicitly require "perfect" synchronization for drivers that have multiple CPUs with shared memory. Turned this on for the arknoid2 driver for now as a test (the interleave on that driver was already very close to perfect anyway).
- 0.128u6            : Aaron Giles enabled all CPU cores/variants. Fixed compile issue revealed as a result. Aaron Giles added new function cpuexec_describe_context(machine) which can be used in logerror() and other printf-style functions to return a description of the current CPU/PC given only the machine. Changed several dozen sites to use this instead of directly interrogating the activecpu. Aaron Giles removed all other uses of activecpu throughout the system. Removed activecpu from the machine structure to prevent future abuse. Aaron Giles removed cpu_push_context() and cpu_pop_context(), and all call sites. Aaron Giles removed get context/set context calls from the CPU interface entirely. Aaron Giles removed safe_cpu_get_pc() which doesn't really make sense anymore. Aaron Giles moved cpu_execute() to be an inline function. Atari Ace removed remaining deprecat.h references from the CPU cores. Aaron Giles expanded cpuexec cycles <-> attotime functions to handle UINT64s.
- 0.128u5            : Aaron Giles removed globals from cpuexec. Also removed ATTOTIME_TO_CYCLES() and ATTOTIME_IN_CYCLES(). Replaced them with functions in cpuexec: cpu_clocks_to_attotime() and cpu_attotime_to_clocks(), both of which take CPU devices instead of indexes. Updated all callers, many of which were using the functions dubiously. Aaron Giles removed cpunum_get_active() calls and activecpu references from all of the CPU cores. Normalized several local CPU state variables to the generic 'cpustate' instead of names_with_underscores. Removed all references to cpunum_get_active() and removed the function entirely [Aaron Giles, Andrew Gardner]. Aaron Giles renamed constants CPU_IS_LE -> ENDIANNESS_LITTLE and CPU_IS_BE -> ENDIANNESS_BIG. Aaron Giles added a number of new cputag_* macros to cpuexec.h. Aaron Giles renumbered CPU and sound get/set info constants to align with the device constants, and shared values where they were perfectly aligned. Aaron Giles set the type field in the fake device_configs for CPU and sound chips to a get_info stub which calls through to the CPU and sound specific get_info functions. This means the device_get_info() functions work for CPU and sound cores, even in their fake state. Aaron Giles changed device information getters from device_info() to device_get_info() to match the CPU and sound macros. Aaron Giles removed cpunum_get_active(). Main important change is that IDE controllers with bus mastering (DMA) need to specify the target address space in the IDE device configuration. Aaron Giles removed mame_find_cpu_index(). Use cputag_get_cpu() instead. Updated all drivers calling this to the newer function, and generally simplified their code as a result. Aaron Giles removed mostly silly uses of activecpu from the CPU cores.
- 27th November  2008: MAME 0.128u4 Changes [Aaron Giles]: A number of people have asked about the changes that went into MAME 0.128u4, and why they were made. This article explains the motivation and reasoning behind these changes, and what still needs to be done. CPU Context Switching: When MAME was originally designed, wasn't envisioned that it would eventually be used to emulate multiple CPUs at the same time. MAME 0.1 was derived from Nicola's Multi-Pac emulator, which emulates Pac-Man based hardware, which consists simply of a single Z80 CPU. Eventually, more arcade games were discovered to run on similar hardware, and a large collection of Z80-based games were quickly supported. Of course it was soon discovered that arcade hardware is much more diverse than a single Z80. Support for additional 8-bit CPUs was added, including the 6502 and 6809. In addition, it quickly became apparent that many games had more than one CPU, so support for multiple CPUs was added. The problem is, the code in the CPU emulators for the various CPUs was not designed to run multiple instances of the same type of CPU, and so in order to make this work, a concept called context switching was introduced. Let's take the Z80 as our example. The main problem with running more than one Z80 CPU at a time is that the Z80 CPU emulator stored the state of the CPU in global variables. At the time (remember this is back in the days of the 386 and DOS), it was faster to fetch data from global variables than to allocate memory for each Z80 and reference all the CPU state via a pointer. So in order to allow the Z80 core to continue to work the way it did, we introduced context switching. With context switching, when MAME needs to stop executing one of the Z80's and begin executing one of the others, it asks the first Z80 to copy all of its relevant global variables to some temporary memory, and then copy the second Z80's state from temporary memory back into the global variables. At this point, the global variables contained the state of the second Z80, and it could be executed normally. In practice, this worked great because MAME would execute the first Z80 for many thousands of cycles, perform a context switch, execute the second Z80 for many thousands of cycles, perform a context switch, etc., so the context switch did not require a significant percentage of the total execution time, because it was only done once every few thousand emulated cycles. Where the problems arise is when we want to do "cycle accurate" execution of these two Z80's. In this case, we really want to run each Z80 for just one or two cycles at a time, and switch back and forth between them many many times per second. When we do this, we execute the first Z80 for a cycle or two, context switch, execute the second Z80 for a cycle or two, switch again, etc. In this situation, it turns out, we spend more time context switching than we do executing. The solution to this is to get rid of the context switching. To do this, we need to allocate memory for each Z80 and instruct each Z80 to reference all of its data from that memory, rather than accessing global variables. In the past, doing this was a bit of a performance penalty, but on modern processors and modern compliers, it is either a wash or marginally faster to do it the "right" way. So one of the major motivations of the changes in MAME 0.128u4 is to make changes that get rid of the CPU context switching. To do this, the interfaces to all the CPU cores had to change, and each core has to be modified to fetch its state from memory pointers instead of global variables. As of the 0.128u4 release, several important CPU cores have been converted, but more work is still pending in this direction. Memory Context Switching: In addition to the way the CPUs do context switching, the memory system in MAME also did the same thing. That is, when a CPU needs to read or write to memory, it works with the memory system to figure out whom to call to implement to read/write behavior. Whenever MAME needed to stop executing of one CPU and begin execution of another, it had to perform a memory context switch, so that memory accesses from the new CPU accessed the correct memory. In order to remove memory context switching, the state of the memory subsystem needed to be moved out of global variables and into allocated memory. The problem is that the memory system wasn't really organized in this manner, so some significant changes had to be made. In the end, I decided to expose the concept of an "address space" to describe the state of the memory subsystem. Each CPU can have one or more address spaces, and whenever the CPU needs to talk to the memory system, it hands a pointer to the relevant address space to the memory system so that the memory system knows how to map that memory access. In addition, when the memory system identifies a particular callback in a game driver to handle a read or a write, it also passes along the pointer to the address space structure, so that the game driver has the information it needs to know about handling that memory access.To make all this work, the interfaces to all the read/write handlers in the system had to change, the memory system had to be rewired, and all the CPU cores had to be modified to pass along these address space objects. As of 0.128u4, the memory context switch has been removed entirely. Completing this work is necessary before we can eliminate the CPU context switching. The "Active" CPU: One of the things that goes hand-in-hand with context switching is the notion of an "active" CPU, which is defined to be the CPU whose context is currently copied into the global variables. As we remove the need for CPU context switching, the notion of an active CPU becomes less well-defined and less meaningful. Take, for example, a CPU (we'll call it CPU A) which can write to the memory space of another CPU (call it CPU B). In a context switching system, when CPU A is executing, CPU A's state is loaded into the global variables, and all of CPU A's memory reads and writes use the global memory state information in order to know what happens when memory is accessed. Logically, CPU A is the "active" CPU. Now let's say CPU A performs some action which causes it to modify CPU B's memory space. In order to do this, we must save off CPU A's state (both CPU and memory state), and load up CPU B's state, thus making CPU B the "active" CPU. Then we perform the access to CPU B's memory space. When finished, we save off CPU B's state and restore CPU A's state so that it can continue executing. In a more modern system, when CPU A is executing, CPU A's state lives off in memory somewhere and can be accessed at any time, and its address spaces are similarly configured so that they can be accessed at any time without context switching. Now CPU A performs the same action which causes it to modify CPU B's memory space. In this case, we don't need to do any context switching. Instead, CPU A can directly modify CPU B's memory space by passing in a pointer to CPU B's address space when it performs its memory operations. It should be obvious that the big difference in these two scenarios is that there is no context switching in the second case, which should make things faster. But even more importantly, there is no "active" CPU at any point in the second case. One could argue that because CPU A is executing, that it should be designated "active"; however, even in this case, CPU B is certainly never considered active, even though it previously would have been. Looking further down the line, if we define a CPU as "active" while it is executing, we consign ourselves to only ever executing a single CPU at a time, because only one CPU can ever be "active" at a time. Thus, the right solution is to get rid of this "active" CPU notion. Unfortunately, the MAME drivers and core are peppered with references to the active CPU. These must go over time. Only when they are gone can we fully remove the context switching; as long as references to the active CPU still exist, we have to continue to context switch in order to keep up a valid definition of the active CPU. What Does This All Mean? For users, all the existing games should continue to work. Speed should be equivalent if not a bit better, especially in situations where there is aggressive context switching today. Once all the context switching is removed, MAME will be doing less work when it switches frequently between different CPUs. Longer term, however, it is likely that some of these cases will get slower again, because for many early games, the multiple CPUs work closely in concert, and to achieve the most accurate behavior, we ideally should execute each CPU one instruction at a time, alternating back and forth very quickly. Today, this makes performance very bad; with the context switching changes in, I hope it will be bearable at least for many of the 8-bit systems. For developers, these changes mean that MAME is more object-oriented. Even though MAME is written in straight C and not C++, you can imagine that core structures in the system such as running_machine, device_config, and address_space are objects, and pointers to these objects are passed in and out of most calls in the system. There should be very few if any cases where the need for an "active" CPU is necessary any more, and references to the global Machine (capital "M") object are removed in favor of pointers to that machine that are passed into your functions. The changes we are making aren't particularly revolutionary from a software architecture point of view, but they are revolutionary from a MAME design point of view. There are still many more changes to come as we push toward removing the CPU context switching altogether, but as of MAME 0.128u4 the core infrastructure is in place to make these changes happen. This particular update was the "biggie"; future updates along this path should be smaller until we are in a position to finally remove the CPU context switch for good.
- 0.128u4            : Removed emu\cpuint.c/h. IMPORTANT NOTICE: This update represents the first part of a monumental internal change within MAME in the way CPU cores are managed and how memory is addressed. There are two ways you can help get these changes sorted out. Aaron Giles converted remaining CPU cores over to new memory functions. Major cpuintrf changes [Aaron Giles]: Added a set of cpu_* calls which accept a CPU device object; these are now the preferred means of manipulating a CPU. Removed the cpunum_* calls; added an array of cpu[] to the running_machine object; converted all existing cpunum_* calls to cpu_* calls, pulling the CPU device object from the new array in the running_machine. Removed the activecpu_* calls; added an activecpu member to the running_machine object; converted all existing activecpu_* calls to cpu_* calls, pulling the active CPU device object from the running_machine. Changed cpuintrf_push_context() to cpu_push_context(), taking a CPU object pointer; changed cpuintrf_pop_context() to cpu_pop_context(); eventually these will go away. Many other similar changes moving toward a model where all CPU references are done by the CPU object and not by index. Added CPU device parameters to all CPU callbacks except for the context ones (which are going away), and the validity check. Populated tag and static_config parts of fake CPU device. Removed 'config' parameter from CPU_INIT. Modified CPU cores to pull config from the device static_config. Massive API cleanup/change [Aaron Giles]: The primary goal is that all CPU-related APIs now take a device pointer instead of an index. All functions that take a CPU device are prefixed with cpu_*. All functions that are globally related to cpu execution are prefixed with cpuexec_*. Below is a list of some of the mappings: cpu_boost_interleave -> cpuexec_boost_interleave, cpunum_suspend -> cpu_suspend, cpunum_resume -> cpu_resume, cpunum_is_suspended -> cpu_is_suspended, cpunum_get_clock -> cpu_get_clock, cpunum_set_clock -> cpu_set_clock, cpunum_get_clockscale -> cpu_get_clockscale, cpunum_set_clockscale -> cpu_set_clockscale, cpunum_get_localtime -> cpu_get_local_time, cpunum_gettotalcycles -> cpu_get_total_cycles, activecpu_eat_cycles -> cpu_eat_cycles, activecpu_adjust_icount -> cpu_adjust_icount, cpu_trigger -> cpuexec_trigger, cpu_triggertime -> cpuexec_triggertime, cpunum_set_input_line -> cpu_set_input_line and cpunum_set_irq_callback -> cpu_set_irq_callback. In addition, a number of functions retain the same name but now require a specific CPU parameter to be passed in: cpu_yield, cpu_spin, cpu_spinuntil_time, cpu_spinuntil_int, cpu_spinuntil_trigger and cpu_triggerint. Merged cpuint.c into cpuexec.c. One side-effect of this change is that driver reset callbacks are called AFTER the CPUs and devices are reset. This means that if you make changes to the CPU state and expect the reset vectors to recognize the changes in your reset routine, you will need to manually reset the CPU after making the change (since it has already been reset). Added a number of inline helper functions to cpuintrf.h for managing addresses. Removed cpu_gettotalcpu(). This information is rarely needed outside of the core and can be obtained by looking at the machine->cpu[] array. Changed CPU interrupt acknowledge callbacks to pass a CPU device instead of machine\cpunum pair. Changed VBLANK and periodic timer callbacks to pass a CPU device instead of machine\cpunum pair. Renamed all information getters from cpu_* to cpu_get_* and from cputype_* to cputype_get_*.
- 0.128u3            : Aaron Giles defined macros for all core CPU functions, along with macros for the name and for calling, in the spirit of the devintrf.h macros. Aaron Giles changed the CPU IRQ callbacks to a proper type, and added a device parameter to them. Aaron Giles added machine parameter to cpu_boost_interleave. Aaron Giles updated cpuexec to compute the "perfect" interleave value taking into account the minimum number of cycles per instruction specified by the CPU core. Updated Z80 core to indicate that the minimum cpi is 2. Fixed incorrect minimum cpi in the 68020+ cores. Atari Ace added ADDRESS_MAP_NAME macro, updated CPU cores to use it to reference internal address maps.
- 0.127u8            : Couriersud fixed assertion in cpuint.c.
- 0.127u7            : Aaron Giles fixed various games with: CPU x: PULSE_LINE used with level-detected IRQ y.
- 0.127u4            : CPU-internal regions now have priority again. Fixed mario by installing a handler in the sound_start function [Aaron Giles].
- 0.127u3            : Aaron Giles fixed memory handling of internal banks. They should be LOWER priority than the driver's memory maps. Reverted recent changes to MCS-48 core that were very hacky and which crashed many games. You can now properly override the internal memory map and do your own banking. CPUs, sound chips, devices and ROM-regions which are specified by devices now have their tags auto-prefixed with the device's tag. This allows for multiple instances to be present. For example, the PR-8210 laserdisc player has a CPU with a tag of "pr8210". When it is included as a device by a driver, the driver may tag the device "laserdisc". The resulting final CPU tag name will be "laserdisc:pr8210". Also updated the debugger expression engine to support names with embedded colons [Aaron Giles]. Aaron Giles added checks to ensure that tags used for CPUs, sound chips, regions and devices follow some basic rules: they should be less than 15 characters long, be all lower-case, and only contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dots (no spaces). This is to ensure that they can be used properly in debugger expressions and don't get too long or unwieldy to type (even 15 chars is rather long). Fixed up all tags in the system that failed these checks.
- 0.126u5            : Derrick Renaud updated structure and naming conventions of sound and CPU cores to match core conventions.
- 0.126u4            : Aaron Giles added new functions cputag_set_input_line() to assert input lines via CPU tag instead of index.
- 0.126u3            : Aaron Giles changed the auto-binding behavior of CPU regions. Previously, the first CPU would auto-bind to REGION_CPU1 (that is, any ROM references would automatically assume that they lived in the corresponding region). Now, each CPU automatically binds to the region with the same tag as the CPU itself. This behavior required ensuring that all previous REGION_CPU* regions were changed to regions with the same tag as the CPU.
- 0.126u2            : Aaron Giles changed MDRV_CPU_ADD to require a tag. Removed MDRV_CPU_ADD_TAG. Tagged all CPUs.
- 0.125u9            : Aaron Giles removed calls to memory_set_context() in favor of cpuintrf_push_context().
- 0.125u6            : Added cpu\vtlb.c/h.
- 0.125u3            : Nicola Salmoria fixed cpu_getiloops() which was not returning the correct value. Aaron Giles changed the behavior of the translate callback in the CPU interface: Added new 'intention' parameter to the translate callback to indicate read/write/fetch access, user/supervisor mode, and a flag for debugging. Updated all call sites to pass an appropriate value. Updated all CPU cores to the new prototype.
- 0.124u2            : Oliver Stoenberg added the running_machine* parameter to the function passed into cpunum_set_irq_callback() and adds the IRQ_CALLBACK macro for the callback function.
- 0.123u4            : Zsolt Vasvari removed a couple of unused items from the cpuexec_data structure.
- 0.123u2            : Atari Ace added some missing cores to cpuintrf.c.
- 0.123u1            : Atari Ace improved build independence for CPU/sound cores and fixed some MESS cores that were broken by the deprecat.h changes.
- 0.123              : Aaron Giles fixed regression in cpu_spinuntil* calls that broke a number of games.
- 0.122u8            : Aaron Giles moved cpu_getiloops() and cpu_scalebyfcount() to deprecat.h. Added #include "deprecat.h" where necessary to make this happen. Cleaned up cpuexec.c/h to latest core style. Aaron Giles removed external access to cycles_currently_ran(). Replaced use of cycles_currently_ran() in v9938 code with mame_rand(), since that is effectively the same thing.
- 0.122u6            : Aaron Giles added CPUINFO_INT_CLOCK_MULTIPLIER to support CPU clock multipliers. Updated all CPU cores to return a CPUINFO_INT_CLOCK_MULTIPLIER of 1. Changed the core to actually respect both CPUINFO_INT_CLOCK_MULTIPLIER and CPUINFO_INT_CLOCK_DIVIDER. Updated a number of drivers to use cpunum_get_clock() instead of Machine->drv->cpu[x].clock. Raw input clock speeds should now be specified for all CPUs in the MACHINE_DRIVER.
- 0.122u5            : Atari Ace added machine and cpunum parameters to INTERRUPT_GEN callbacks. Fixed several places that were not using INTERRUPT_GEN or OPBASE_HANDLER macros.
- 0.121u2            : Aaron Giles deprecated cpu_yield* functions except for cpu_yield() itself, which yields for the current timeslice only. Drivers that relied on the other yielding functions should be updated to use cpu_boost_interleave() instead, as it does not have the same negative side effects on time management.
- 0.120u1            : Atari Ace defined strict types for CPU and sound chips. Removed unnecessary cpu_ prefix from several structure members.
- 0.118u5            : Atari Ace changed all comparison for CPU and sound chip types to compare against CPU_DUMMY or Sound_DUMMY instead of 0. Also updated usages of sndti_to_sndnum() so that they use sndti_exists() where appropriate.
- 0.118u4            : Aaron Giles added new functions to the memory system to support CPU cores explicitly specifying the access mask on 32-bit and 64-bit data bus systems. This enables the MIPS core to handle SWL/SWR and SDL/SDR without a read/modify/write cycle. Updated the C and DRC MIPS cores to use this new mechanism.
- 0.116u3            : Zsolt Vasvari changed all CPU cores' internal timers to the mame_timer* functions as well as the remaining couple of core files that still used timer_alloc(). After this, none of the emu\* files have any old style timing code left.
- 0.116              : Atari Ace improved independence of CPU and sound core variants in order to make them more properly separated by the existing compile-time flags.
- 0.114u4            : Aaron Giles changed cpu_boost_interleave(), cpu_spinuntil_time() and cpu_yielduntil_time() to take mame_time parameters instead of doubles. Changed MDRV_CPU_PERIODIC_INT() to take a frequency parameter instead of a time. This is converted internally to a subseconds value.
- 0.113u4            : Now enabling all CPUs by default, which helps ensure that even unused CPUs get updated with core changes, etc [David Haywood]. Zsolt Vasvari updated the Leland driver to the new video timing routines, as well as the remaining drivers. Removed now-obsolete old timing routines from cpuexec.
- 0.111u2            : Nathan Woods added the remaining MESS CPU cores to MAME. They are disabled in the build, but will be maintained along with the MAME CPU cores as future changes are made.
- 0.111u1            : Widespread cleanup of disassemblers and CPU interfaces across the project [Giuseppe Gorgoglione]: Removed from many disassemblers the dependency on eainfo.h. The output produced by those disassemblers has been checked to be the same as before. Extensively rewrote the 6309dasm.c and 6809dasm.c disassemblers. Fixed minor bugs in the v810 and hd6309 interfaces. Removed m68000\cpudefs.h. This was used by the old assembly m68000 core. Removed from m68kmame.c and m68kmame.h as well many references to the old core (e.g A68K0, A68K2, etc.). Properly typedeffed the cpuinfo union, this affects cpuintrf.h and many, many, other files. Converted 8051dasm.c, m65ce02.c and t11dasm.c to use cpuintrf_temp_str() instead of local string pools. Moved the info.s = cpuintrf_temp_str() initialization to: activecpu_get_info_string(), cpunum_get_info_string() and cputype_get_info_string(). This allows us to remove tons of info->s = cpuintrf_temp_str() statements from the xxx_get_info() accessors of every CPU core, making them more readable.
- 0.109u4            : Aaron Giles removed obsolete CPUINFO_PTR_REGISTER_LAYOUT and CPUINFO_PTR_WINDOW_LAYOUT data items.
- 0.104u8            : Nathan Woods added cpunum_set_clock_period(), a variation of cpunum_set_clock() that takes subseconds_t, providing better granularity.
- 0.104u6            : Atari Ace and Aaron Giles reduced global namespace pollution by marking many global functions explicitly static, especially in the CPU cores. Nathan Woods added validity checks to ensure CPU core completeness.
- 0.104u5            : Atari Ace and Aaron Giles cleaned up include files in CPU/sound cores. CPU cores should generally only need to include cpuintrf.h. Sound cores should generally only need to include sndintrf.h. Made it a fatal error to request operations on invalid sound/CPU indexes. These have been logged to the error.log in the past, but really need to be cleaned up. Added a new function safe_activecpu_get_pc() that can be used when logging PCs to smartly detect whether or not it is safe to call activecpu_get_pc(). Changed CPU init/reset callbacks. The init callback now accepts a number of parameters, including the CPU index, the clock, a generic configuration parameter, and a pointer to the IRQ callback. The reset callback no longer takes any parameters (the configuration parameter has been moved to the init callback). And the IRQ_CALLBACK getter/setter has been removed since this is now set up once at initialization time [Aaron Giles].
- 0.104u2            : Aaron Giles removed scrbitmap and memory_region from the global Machine structure. There is no need for non-core systems to access these directly.
- 0.103u5            : Added cpu\cpu.mak.
- 30th January   2006: R. Belmont - A couple of people have recently asked for an introduction to how emulation actually works at a lower level. Introduction: At their lowest level, digital computers run programs that composed ultimately of a stream of numbers (this is called machine language). For a given CPU chip, certain numbers always mean certain things. For instance, on a 6502, the number '105? translates to 'ADC' or Add with Carry. It's important to realize that every time the 6502 encounters instruction 105 it will always perform the same addition operation. You could, in fact, write a valid program composed entirely of instruction 105, although it wouldn't be very interesting. Incidentally, the 3-letter code for the instruction ('ADC' in this case) is what is called assembly language, sometimes abbreviated ASM. Most programs for 8 bit processors were written in this manner - it's somewhat cryptic, but it also gives you full control with minimum size. The number itself is known as an opcode (operation code). Inside the CPU there's hardware to fetch the next instruction number from memory, figure out what it is, and execute it. Now, there's nothing digital hardware can do that digital software can't also do. So emulation starts off with a block of code (a CPU core) which does the same thing for a given type of processor, like a 6502 or Z80. In C-like pseudo-code, it would look something like this: CPU_Start: opcode = fetch_next_opcode(); if (opcode = 105) do_addition_with_carry(); else print 'ERROR: Unknown opcode!'; goto CPU_Start;  . That is remarkably close to how most real CPU cores work, incidentally. The major difference is ususally that a C switch statement is used to efficiently go to the right place for each opcode. Yeah, but where's the wakka-wakka come from? Each CPU has a limited amount of memory it can talk to. For 8 bit CPUs this was usually 64K (65,536 units). This means that each unit of memory has an address (similar to the one on your home) from 0 to 65,535. Some of this memory must be dedicated to the program itself (usually stored in ROMs). Some must be dedicated to a work area for the program (so-called work RAM). But addresses don't have to be just memory - they can also be devices. For instance, in Pac-Man, one set of memory addresses controls the horizontal and vertical positions of Pac-Man. By writing different numbers there, the video hardware will dutifully draw Pac-Man at various places on the screen without further CPU intervention. (This is quite a time-saver for the CPU!) Such special addresses are called registers or sometimes switches. For emulation, this is relatively easy. CPU cores don't want to tie themselves to one machine, so they call out to other code in the emulator (sometimes called the memory manager or memory mapper). To read a memory location, they call out with an address and expect to get an answer back from elsewhere in the emulator. To write a memory location, they call out with the address and the new number to place at that address. Code elsewhere in the emulator figures out for the current game if that address is work RAM, program storage, or something else entirely. The complete set of valid memory addresses for a machine is called a memory map. A simplified real-world example is Pac-Man once again. Addresses 0 to 16,383 are program storage (ROM chips in this case). Addresses 20,464 through 20,479 control the screen positions of Pac-Man and the ghosts. Address 20,480 contains the current status of the joystick. And so on. If you respond properly to all of the necessary addresses you get a running game. That is how basic emulation works.
- 0.103u3            : Nathan Woods added CPUINFO_PTR_DEBUG_SETUP_COMMANDS: a callback that is invoked to tell CPU cores to set up commands specific to a CPU core.
- 0.102u5            : Nathan Woods changed activecpu_dasm() and activecpu_dasm_new() so that they "function" even if the getinfo handler does not specify CPUINFO_PTR_DISASSEMBLE nor CPUINFO_PTR_DISASSEMBLE_NEW.
- 14th December  2005: Aaron Giles - CPU Scheduling in MAME (part 4): Part 3 of this series discussed the problems involved in scheduling communication from a "later" CPU (one scheduled later in the round-robin order) to an "earlier" CPU. Since the MAME scheduler does not support changing the order of CPU execution within the round-robin, the only options to improve latency are to increase the interleave factor, either globally or temporarily. There are two other means of altering the scheduling of CPUs during execution. These are the cpu_yield() and cpu_spin() calls. Both of these methods have been abused often in the past due to a lack of understanding about how they actually work, so now is the time to set the record straight. What cpu_yield() does is end the current CPU's timeslice early. It does not affect the execution of any other CPUs in the system. Let's look at an example. Again we'll say that CPU #0 is running at 14MHz, and CPU #1 is running at 2MHz. There is a scheduled timer that is set to fire at time 0.000150. So we begin executing CPU #0 for 2100 cycles, but this time, partway through its timeslice (say, 1250 cycles in), one of its read/write handlers calls cpu_yield(). This aborts the current timeslice, leaving CPU #0's local time set to 0.000089286. Now CPU #1 gets its turn to execute. Normally it would have executed for its entire timeslice up to time 0.000150; however, since the previous CPU stopped early, the scheduler only schedules up to the time when the previous CPU stopped execution. This equates to 0.000089286 * 2,000,000 = 179 cycles. Let's say it executes for 180 cycles, giving it a local time of 0.00009. At this point, we tell the timer system that the global time is 0.000089286, but there are no timers ready to fire until 0.000150, so nothing happens, and the round robin begins again, scheduling each CPU to execute until 0.000150. Simple enough; this looks like it is the equivalent of setting an "instant" timer that goes off. Ah, but there is an additional side-effect that is not immediately obvious. cpu_yield() belongs to a class of synchronization calls: cpu_yielduntil_trigger(), cpu_yielduntil_int(), cpu_yielduntil_time(). All of these perform a cpu_yield() but have the additional side effect that the CPU is descheduled until the specified trigger/interrupt/time is signalled. This has some interesting consequences. Let's look at the previous example again, except that instead of calling cpu_yield(), we will call cpu_yielduntil_time(0.00005). This is essentially telling the scheduler to not only give up our timeslice, but remove us from the scheduling equation altogether for the next 50 microseconds. So: CPU #0 executes as before, ending its timeslice early at time 0.000089286 by calling cpu_yielduntil_time(0.00005). This aborts its timeslice and also internally sets a timer to go off at the current local time (0.000089286) plus 0.00005 seconds, or at time 0.000139286. Then CPU #1 executes up to the time when the previous CPU stopped execution, which is time 0.000089286. This is again 179 cycles, so we run the CPU, and it comes back claiming 180 cycles, making its local time now 0.00009. The timer system is called, but nothing is ready to fire, so the round-robin starts over. This time, when we ask the timer system when the next timer is set to go off, it reports 0.000139286, due to the timer that was set in response to cpu_yielduntil_time(). Now the round-robin begins again, except that CPU #0 is completely removed from the scheduling, so we skip right to CPU #1. Computing cycles: ((0.000139286 - 0.00009) * 2,000,000) = 99 cycles. We run CPU #1 with that request, and get back 101 cycles, putting its local time at 0.0001405, and the round-robin ends. At this point, the timer set in cpu_yielduntil_time() fires, and it enables CPU #0 to be scheduled for the next round. However, notice that the two CPUs are now signficantly out of sync with respect to each other. CPU #0 is still stuck back at local time 0.000089286, while CPU #1 is already at 0.0001405. There is still a timer set to go off at 0.000150, so that will be used as the target for the next round-robin. For CPU #0, that next pass at execution will run 0.000150 - 0.000089286 = 0.000060714 seconds, or 850 cycles, which is much longer than normal because it needs to execute more cycles to catch up to the target time. CPU #1, on the other hand, is almost at the target time, and only needs to execute 19 cycles to reach the target. So the big side-effect of using cpu_yielduntil_time() in this manner is that you cause the yielding CPU to get behind in the scheduling process. Repeated use of the yield calls can put the CPU farther and farther behind, which can result in some seriously wacky behavior. For example, since CPU #0 is starting out at a time significantly behind CPU #1, if it sets a timer, that timer could already be in the past relative to CPU #1. Analagous to the cpu_yield() calls are the cpu_spin() calls. These calls operate exactly the same as their partners, except that the local time for a spinning CPU is automatically bumped to the current global time at the end of each timeslice. This means that the CPU doesn't get behind; rather, it effectively "burns" all of the remaining cycles in a way that the spinning CPU will never get them back. The thing that is confusing to people is this: Yielding is a form of synchronization. Spinning is a hack. Even though they look similar, they are used for two very different purposes. There is really only one legitimate reason for spinning, and that is for adding spin loop optimizations to games that are doing no useful work while waiting for some event. If the event happens at some known time in the future, use cpu_spinuntil_time(). If that event is an interrupt, use cpu_spinuntil_int(). If that event is some other externally-driver factor, use cpu_spinuntil_trigger(), and then call cpu_trigger() when the event occurs. If you find yourself using a cpu_spin() call for synchronization, you are masking some other problem in the emulation system. Finally, a word about triggers. Triggers are simply a signalling mechanism that is used to indicate that a particular event has occurred. A trigger is identified by an integer, which is essentially a random number that is chosen by the person creating/using the trigger. There is no collision detection or means of allocating them (though there probably should be). To signal a trigger, you simply call cpu_trigger() with the trigger identifier. Triggers are mostly used in conjunction with the yield and spin calls to block execution of a CPU until the trigger is signalled. It's really no more complicated than that.
- 12th December  2005: Aaron Giles - CPU Scheduling in MAME (part 3): Part 2 of this article discussed the cooperation between the scheduler and timers that enables events to be synchronized between multiple CPUs. In short, when a CPU needs to signal an event to another CPU, it sets an "instant" timer which causes all CPUs to execute up to that point in time. Then, the timer callback is fired and the event can be signalled safely and accurately. The big problem with this approach is that it really only works well if the target CPU has a local time that is less than the current time. The example we looked at last time had CPU #0 signalling an interrupt to CPU #1. Since the round-robin ordering causes CPU #0 to execute first, we were (pretty much) guaranteed that when CPU #0 wanted to issue its signal, its local time would be greater than the local time of CPU #1. But what happens when CPU #1 wants to send a signal back to CPU #0? Taking the naive approach, and returning back to our previous example, let's say that we have CPU #0 running at 14MHz, and CPU #1 running at 2MHz. There is a scheduled timer that is set to fire in 150usecs, or at time 0.000150. So we begin executing CPU #0 for 2100 cycles, and it completes its timeslice normally, returning 2112 cycles, meaning its local time ends up being 0.000150857. Now we execute CPU #1 for its timeslice, which turns out to be 300 cycles as in the example from Part 1. However, this time, at 50 cycles into execution, CPU #1 decides that it needs to send a signal to CPU #0. So, rather than sending the signal immediately, it sets an instant timer to go off immediately, at time = 50 / 2,000,000 = 0.000025. This also has the side effect of aborting the execution of CPU #1 and ending the current round robin. So, at this point, the scheduler contacts the timer system and indicates that the global time should be updated to the minimum of all the CPUs' local times, which would be 0.000025. The timer system sees that there is a timer scheduled to go off at 0.000025, and fires it; in the callback, we send our signal to CPU #0. But wait, isn't CPU #0's local time already way off in the future at 0.000150857? Yep. This means that the signal arrives much later that it should have (0.000150857 - 0.000025 = 0.000125857 seconds, or 1762 CPU cycles too late), and we have lost our synchronization. How do we solve this problem? Well, we could have swapped the execution order, making the scheduler execute CPU #1 first. But in order to do that, we would have needed to predict the future once again. If the communication details between two CPUs are well-understood and follow strict rules, then it might be possible to make this sort of fine-grain scheduler tweaking work. Up to now, however, there has not been a good case made for running out-of-order like this. And so the round-robin order remains fixed. Traditionally in MAME - in fact, even before I ever wrote the timer system and the scheduler - the way this sort of communication issue was resolved was to increase the interleave factor between CPUs. The interleave factor was a number that indicated how frequently the CPUs in MAME were configured to re-synchronize their execution times each video frame. (This was specified in terms of video frames originally because all timing in MAME was done relative to video frames before the timers existed). The interleave factor is specified globally in MAME's machine driver structure. It is implemented by computing how many times per second the synchronization is implied (for example, an interleave of 100 with a game that runs at 60Hz, would imply 6000 synchronizations per second), and simply setting a timer with a NULL callback to go off at that rate. No callback is needed because no action needs to be performed; rather, the mere existence of the timer firing at that rate effectively brings all CPU into sync at that frequency. Back to our example, let's say our game runs at a 60Hz frame rate, and we bump the interleave factor to 500. That will ensure for us 500 * 60 = 30,000 synchronizations per second, or once every 0.000033333 seconds. This means that there will be a timer set to fire every 0.000033333 like clockwork. So let's re-evaluate what happens and why the interleave improves things. Remember that the timer system figures out when the first timer is set to fire. Previously, our first timer was going to go off at 0.000150, but now we have this interleave timer which is going to go off even earlier at 0.000033333, so that determines what our first timeslice will be. Taking 0.000033333 * 14,000,000 gives us 467 cycles, so we execute CPU #0 for 467 cycles. Let's say it comes back having executed 470 cycles. That puts our local time at 0.000033571. Now we execute CPU #1 for its timeslice, which turns out to be 67 cycles with the new timer in place. Again, at 50 cycles into execution, CPU #1 decides that it needs to send a signal to CPU #0. So we set an instant timer to go off immediately, at time = 0.000025. This ends the round robin, and the timer system is notified just as before. This time, however, CPU #0 receives the signal at 0.000033571, which is only 0.000008571 seconds or 120 CPU cycles too late. This is a big improvement over 1762 cycles, but it's still not perfect. By increasing the interleave we could make it even better if we wanted. In fact, the interleave factor effectively determines the worst case latency for a signal from one CPU to another. Could we make it perfect? Well, actually, we could. If we set up a timer to run at a frequency of 2,000,000 times per second (the clock speed of the 2nd fastest CPU), then we would get as close as possible to perfect interleave. CPU #0 would never execute longer than a single clock on CPU #1, so when CPU #1 sent a signal, it would hit CPU #0 at the same time as the end of that particular clock cycle on CPU #1. To set the interleave that high would require specifying an interleave of 33333 in the game's machine driver. Try it sometime. Things get very very slow. This is because a context switch between two CPUs is not free, and when you try to set up a timer to run that frequently, you spend all your time context switching and very little time actually executing any code on the CPUs. The ideal solution to this is to detect when it is likely that CPU #1 needs to signal CPU #0, and temporarily boost the interleave so that, at least for a while, synchronization is guaranteed. This is the purpose of the cpu_boost_interleave call. It takes two parameters. The first parameter is how frequently the timer should fire - note that it is not specified in terms of video frames, but rather as an absolute time. You can also pass 0 here, which causes the system to automatically pick the clock rate of the 2nd fastest CPU, which will give you ideal synchronization. The second parameter specifies how long, in seconds, you want to maintain this level of interleave. Generally, you don't want it on too long. Most commonly, games in MAME are set up so that "master" CPUs are run first, and communication tends to go from earlier CPUs to later ones in the round-robin order. Interleave boosting is used in these cases when the "slave" CPUs need to send some information back, and the master is sitting there waiting for a response. Keep in mind that none of these systems are perfect, yet they have been successfully used for many thousands of different platforms.
-  9th December  2005: Aaron Giles - CPU Scheduling in MAME (part 2): Part 1 described the basic round robin scheduling algorithm used by MAME when running multiple CPUs. It can be summarized as: 1. Determine when the next timer is going to fire. 2. Loop over each CPU: Compute the difference between this time and the CPU's local time, execute for at least that long and count up the cycles executed and compute the CPU's local time. 3. Return to step 1. Now this is all fine and great when you can predict the future - notice that step 1 requires you to do just that. And many events in MAME are in fact periodic and predictable in nature, so this works out ok as a starting point. One very common event that isn't predictable, however, is communication between two CPUs. In fact, this is one of the main reasons I added the timer system to MAME in the first place. Let's look at an example of what can go wrong with CPU communication when there is no synchronization. Going back to our previous example, we have CPU #0 running at 14MHz, and CPU #1 running at 2MHz. We also know there is a timer that is going to fire in 150usecs, or at time 0.000150. So we begin executing CPU #0 for 2100 cycles. This time, however, the code executing on CPU #0 decides to signal an interrupt to CPU #1 at a point 1500 cycles into its execution (at time = 1500 / 14,000,000 = 0.000107143). With no synchronization, the interrupt is signalled (generally some state is set in CPU #1's context indicating that an interrupt is pending), and CPU #0 continues executing until the end of its timeslice. When it's done, it has executed 2112 cycles like before, and its local time is 0.000150857. Now it's time to execute CPU #1 for the first time. Right away, however, it notices that it has an interrupt pending, so it may process the interrupt, and then continue executing for the rest of its timeslice normally. So what's the problem? Well, CPU #0 signalled the interrupt at local time = 0.000107143, but CPU #1 acted on the interrupt at local time = 0 (right at the start of its timeslice). Let's say CPU #1 is a sound CPU; maybe the music started just a fraction of a second too early as a result. Worse, let's say CPU #1 was busy doing something else and wasn't ready to handle the interrupt just then. Maybe you've crashed the code or altered its state in a bad way. What might not be immediately obvious in looking at the timer system is that most of the timers that are created are set to fire instantly. If you've even seen timer_set(TIME_NOW, ...) in MAME, you've seen a request for a instant timer. This is done because timers are effectively synchronization barriers. The whole scheduling algorithm is based upon executing all the CPUs until the time when the next timer is set to fire. Setting up an instant timer is essentially asking the scheduler and the timer system to work together to bring all the CPUs up to the current instant in time before calling the function you provide it. How does this help the interrupt signalling issue described above? Let's say that when CPU #0 decides to signal an interrupt to CPU #1, it doesn't signal it immediately. Rather, it sets an instant timer to go off. Since the current time = 0.000107143, that is when the timer is scheduled to fire. But timers don't fire until the end of the round robin sequence, and then only after all CPUs have reached that time. So even if we were at the end of the round robin, it still wouldn't be able to fire just yet because CPU #1 is still sitting back at time = 0. We have another issue here as well. CPU #0 has just set a timer to go off at time = 0.000107143, but it also still has 600 cycles left to execute before the end of its timeslice. We could potentially allow it to complete its run, ending up at time = 0.000150857. But then when we executed CPU #1, we would only execute up until the time the timer was set to go off (at 0.000107143), and the two CPUs would be significantly out of sync. Rather than letting that happen, whenever a new timer is created during a timeslice, and it is scheduled to fire before that timeslice is up, the timer system and the scheduler work together to abort the execution of that CPU. Generally, this means that the CPU will stop executing at the end of the current instruction, and return control back to the scheduler. In this case, since CPU #0 set the timer during its timeslice, and since the timer is scheduled to fire during the timeslice, execution on CPU #0 is aborted with 600 cycles left to go. The scheduler knows that CPU #0 only executed 1500 of its requested 2100 cycles, and updates the local time of CPU #0 to be 1500 / 14,000,000 = 0.000107143. Now CPU #1 gets its chance to execute. 0.000107143 * 2,000,000 = 215 cycles, so we execute CPU #1 for that long. When it is finished, maybe it actually executed 217 cycles, so its local time is 0.0001085. The global time is updated to the minimum of the CPU times, in this case 0.000107143, and the timer system is asked to process timers. At this point, the callback for the instant timer we set is called, and in that callback is where we signal the interrupt to CPU #1. Returning to the scheduler, we look into the future and see that there is still a timer set to go off at time = 0.000150, so we compute cycles for CPU #0 (600) and execute. After CPU #0 is done, we switch to CPU #1 and start executing. CPU #1 now has an interrupt pending, but it has been signalled at the correct local time (or close to it, at 0.0001085), and synchronization between the two CPUs has been achieved. What happens when CPU #1 tries to talk back to CPU #0? Find out in part 3, which will deal with this complex issue.
-  7th December  2005: Aaron Giles - CPU Scheduling in MAME (part 1): Multi-CPU games in MAME are scheduled in a round-robin fashion. The order of the round robin execution is strictly defined by the order of the CPUs in the machine driver. There is no way to alter this order; however, you can affect the scheduling by suspending CPUs or adjusting the granularity of the scheduling. That kind of stuff will be discussed more in part 2. The scheduler relies on the timer system, which knows when the next timer is scheduled. All scheduling happens between firings of timers. Similarly, timers are never fired while a CPU is executing. This important to keep in mind. The scheduler queries the timer system to find out when the next timer is set to fire. It then loops over each CPU, computes how many cycles that CPU needs to execute to reach that time, and runs the CPU for that many cycles. When the CPU is finished executing, it returns how many cycles it actually executed. This information is accumulated and converted back into a "local CPU time", in order to account for overshooting or early exiting from the CPU core. For example... Let's say that CPU #0 is running at 14MHz, and CPU #1 is running at 2MHz. Let's also say that we're starting at time 0 (local CPU time for both CPUs is 0), and a timer is scheduled to go off in 150 microseconds (time = 0.000150). The round robin logic will start with CPU #0 and compute how many cycles it needs to execute to reach 0.000150. Since we're starting from time 0, we need to execute for at least 150usec. 0.000150 * 14,000,000 = 2100 cycles. It then calls that CPU's execute function with 2100 cycles; when the execute function returns, it specifies how many cycles it actually ran. Let's say it returns saying that it ran 2112 cycles. (CPU cores generally overshoot because many instructions take more than 1 cycle each to execute.) 2112 cycles puts the local CPU time for CPU #0 at 0.000150857 (2112 / 14,000,000). Now it's time for CPU #1 to execute. 0.000150 * 2,000,000 = 300 cycles. So we call execute(300), and get back 300 cycles. CPU #1 local time is now 0.000150. At this point, both CPUs have executed, and both their local times are greater than or equal to the target time 0.000150. So the scheduler calls the timer system to let it process the timers. When finished, it again asks when the next timer will fire. Let's say it's set to fire exactly 150usec later at time = 0.000300. Back to the scheduler, we start the round robin over again. CPU #0 needs to execute (0.000300 - 0.000150857) * 14,000,000 = 2088 cycles to reach a local time of 0.300. Note that we took into account the extra cycles that we executed last time. So we call execute(2088), and we get back, say, 2091. That puts our local time at 0.000150857 + 0.000149357 = 0.000300214. Now it's CPU #1's turn. (0.000300 - 0.000150) * 2,000,000 = 300 cycles again. Calling execute(300), we get back 302 cycles. This puts CPU #1's local time at 0.000150 + 0.000151 = 0.000301. Again, both CPUs have executed, both their local times are greater than or equal to 0.000300, so we contact the timer system to let it run its timers. This procedure continues throughout the execution of the system. Some things to note here. After the first round robin, CPU #0's local time was slightly ahead of CPU #1's local time. After the second pass, the opposite was true. Thus, you can't be guaranteed at any time that any given CPU is ahead of or behind the others. Also, be sure to keep in mind that each CPU has its own local time. The timer system also has a "global time". The global time is generally the minimum of all the CPU local times. Which time is used when calling the timer system depends entirely upon which CPU context is currently active. If a CPU context is active (generally true only while a CPU is executing; for example, in read/write callbacks), then all timer operations treat the "current time" as the CPU local time, accounting for all cycles that have been executed on that CPU so far in the current timeslice. If a CPU context is not active (all other times; for example, in timer callbacks), then the "current time" is the global time. The global time is updated at the end of each timeslice before the scheduler calls into the timer system to let it run its timers, and that global time is used to dispatch the timers.
- 0.101u3            : Aaron Giles changed the way encrypted CPU memory is allocated and managed. Previously, memory_set_opcode_base() was used to set a single pointer to the decrypted opcodes; however this presented a number of limitations. Now that all RAM and ROM-like regions are assigned banks, the memory system now tracks decrypted opcodes per bank. For implicit banks (marked RAM or ROM in the memory map), a new function memory_set_decrypted_region() configures which areas of the address space contain decrypted opcodes and where the decrypted opcodes live. For explicit banks, there is a new function memory_configure_bank_decrypted() which operates identically to memory_configure_bank() but specifies a pointer to the decrypted opcodes on a per-bank basis. Updated all drivers using the old mechanism to the new mechanism and removed the old system.
- 0.101u2            : Aaron Giles added support for logical mapping to the CPU interfaces and debugger. CPUs that have an MMU now need to support several new interface bits, including a logical address mask and page size for each address space, as well as a new translate function. There is also a new disassembler interface that should be used going forward, which will make it much simpler to keep the disassemblers standalone and not dependent on MAME functions for opcode accesses. Converted the i386 core to use the new interfaces.
- 0.99u7             : Aaron Giles fixed crash when running games whose CPU core did not support save states.
- 0.95u4             : Aaron Giles removed CPU_16BIT_PORT hack; this means that all Z80 drivers must explicitly clamp their I/O space address space to 8-bits via ADDRESS_MAP_FLAGS(AMEF_ABITS(8)). Removed CPU_AUDIO_CPU; it was no longer having any effect, and it was a poor substitution for documentation since it wasn't used consistently across all games.
- 0.95               : CPUs tagged as audio CPUs are no longer disabled when sound is turned off [Aaron Giles].
- 0.94u2             : cpuintrf.c cleanup [Aaron Giles].
- 0.81u7             : Ville Linde added a check enabled when MAME_DEBUG is defined that raises an error if the CPU core executed a negative cycle count (src\cpuexec.c).
- 0.81u5             : Aaron Giles removed vblank callback logging left in by mistake.
- 0.80               : Nathan Woods introduces cpu_getscanlinetime_mt() and cpu_getscanlineperiod_mt(); variants on their namesake calls except they return mame_time instead of double (src\cpuexec.c).
- 0.79u3             : Nathan Woods added a new consistency check on CPUs to check for the existence of certain get_info cases needed for debugging. This consistency check is currently only enabled for MESS (src\mame.c).
- 0.79u2             : CPU specific memory map fix [Aaron Giles]. Nathan Woods added a new consistency check for drivers that use non-existent CPU cores (src\mame.c).
- 0.79u1             : Support for CPU-specific internal memory maps [Aaron Giles].
- 0.78u4             : Address spaces are now determined dynamically based on whether a given CPU returns a non-zero value for the address bus width for a given space [Aaron Giles].
- 0.78u3             : smf fixed cpuintrf compile bug with DJGPP.
- 0.78u2             : The significant change in this release is the way CPUs are defined and referenced. Previously, the file cpuintrf.c contained a huge table with many pointers into each CPU, and a bunch of data about each CPU type. This was problematic to maintain, and left a bunch of data out of the CPU core to be defined by MAME instead. The new release defines a new function that every CPU core must implement, of the form: <cputype>_get_info(UINT32 state, union cpuinfo *info). This is the only public function defined for each CPU core. The table in cpuintrf.c now simply consists of an enumerated index for the CPU type, followed by the pointer to the actual CPU's get_info function. The flexible get_info function is then responsible for providing pointers to all the remaining functions. In addition, the number of other functions has been greatly reduced: void set_info(UINT32 state, union cpuinfo *info); void get_context(void *context); void set_context(void *context); void init(void); void reset(void *param); void exit(void); int execute(int cycles); void burn(int cycles) and offs_t disassemble(char *buffer, offs_t pc). The old functions get_reg, set_reg, set_irq_line, set_irq_callback, info, get_cycle_table, set_cycle_table have all been incorporated into get_info and set_info. All the existing MAME CPU cores have been updated to work with this new system. Also, for most cores, all functions and the icount global variable have been made static apart from the get_info function. A number of selectors for get_info/set_info have been defined to return information about the CPU, including the address and data bus sizes for all address spaces, clock dividers, IRQ line size, context size, etc. NOTE TO PORTERS: the cpuintrf[] array is now populated dynamically by the cpuintrf_init() function. This means that if you have informational code or other code that relies on the CPU information being present (i.e., if you call any of the cputype_* functions) before calling run_game(), you must manually call cpuintrf_init() first. Don't worry, it is safe to call cpuintrf_init() multiple times.
-  8th January   2004: smf sent in a small fix for compiling cpuintrf.c in DJGPP.
- 0.76u2             : Aaron Giles added new function: activecpu_eat_cycles(cycles), needed for idle skipping in certain situations.
- 0.75               : Nathan Woods added a call cpuintrf_set_dasm_override() that gives drivers the ability to customize disassemblies. This probably isn't very useful for MAME, but it is useful for MESS for things like software interrupts used for BIOS calls. Aaron Giles changed scanline timing to use floor() to get consistent results and fixed bug in time computation if requesting a scanline in the next frame.
- 0.69a              : A number of changes to the timer system [Aaron Giles]: All the CPU scheduling has moved into cpuexec.c and been taken out of timer.c. A number of bugs relating to time tracking for suspended CPUs have been fixed. A side effect of all this is a change in the behavior of the CPU scheduling. For the most part, games are fine with this. However, there were a few exceptions: taitosj.c: timing of the MCU communication broke, arkanoid.c: timing of the MCU communication broke and harddriv.c: stunrun timing glitches, racedriv/steeltal/hdrivair broken. There may be more, but I haven't found them yet. The first two problems have been fixed, as has racedriv, but steeltal, hdrivair and stunrun still have issues. Oh, one other useful function I added is this: cpu_boost_interleave(double timeslice_duration, double boost_duration). You call this if you need to temporarily crank up the interleave for a short period of time in order to get CPU synchronization working. I used this in arkanoid and taitosj to get the MCU communications working. For example, you could say: cpu_boost_interleave(TIME_IN_USEC(1), TIME_IN_USEC(100)) which would interleave the CPUs on 1 usec boundaries for the next 100 usecs. Even more useful is this: cpu_boost_interleave(0, TIME_IN_USEC(10)). A very small value (0) for the first parameter means "use perfect synchronization", which should guarantee cycle-accurate synchronization for the specified duration. Note that this is *really* slow, so you don't want to be doing it too much! Let us know ASAP if anything else is broken as a result of this update.
- 0.58               : Added src\cpuint.c/h. The old interrupt system has now been made officially obsolete. This means that the function cpu_cause_interrupt() is no longer available; you must use cpu_set_irq_line() or cpu_set_irq_line_and_vector() instead. It also means that a number of old/conflicting constants have been removed. In addition, interrupt generation callbacks for CPUs no longer return an IRQ line or vector. Instead, the interrupt callback must actively cause the interrupt via cpu_set_irq_line(). All existing drivers have been updated to these changes. New interrupt callback functions: nmi_line_pulse(), nmi_line_assert(), irqn_line_hold(), irqn_line_pulse(), irqn_line_assert(). These functions replace the old interrupt() and nmi_interrupt() callbacks and can be used directly as interrupt callbacks. The following old functions and macros have now been fully deprecated: cpu_get_pc() -> activecpu_get_pc(), cpu_get_sp() -> activecpu_get_sp(), cpu_getpreviouspc() -> activecpu_get_previouspc(), cpu_get_reg() -> activecpu_get_reg(), cpu_set_reg() -> activecpu_set_reg(), cpu_set_op_base() -> activecpu_set_op_base(), cpu_get_pc_byte() -> activecpu_get_pc_byte(), READ_WORD -> (no equivalent) and WRITE_WORD -> (no equivalent).
- 29th August    2001: Aaron Giles sent another CPU interface cleanup update, removing redundant code and improving the interface.
- 0.54               : Added src\cpuexec.c/h. Major changes to the CPU interface. As a result of this, some games are temporarily broken, most notably CPS2 [Aaron Giles].
- 22nd August    2001: Aaron Giles started cleaning up the CPU interface and fixing obscure bugs in it.
- 14th November  2000: Aaron Giles fixed a bug in CPU interface that caused suspended CPUs to never get released.
- 0.37b7             : Important for porters: The HAS_XXX constants for cpu and sound emulation are no longer #defined in cpuintrf.h if they were not already defined. They are set by the makefile (rules.mak). If you are not using that in your port, you'll have to make sure that all constants are initialized somewhere.
- 0.37b5             : New functions in cpuintrf.c: cpu_get/set_cycle_table(), cpu_set_irq_callback() + New CPU cores and fixes to old ones [Juergen Buchmueller].
- 20th July      2000: Juergen Buchmueller submitted some new functionality to the CPU interfaces.
- 0.36               : Juergen Buchmueller added cpu overclocking control to the on screen display (available only when cheats are enabled).
- 0.36RC1            : Lots of CPU fixes and cleanup [Juergen Buchmueller].
- 0.36b12            : Juergen Buchmueller added cpu overclocking control to the on screen display.
- 0.36b7             : Replaced cpu_reset() with cpu_set_reset_line(). cpu_set_reset_line(num,PULSE_LINE) is equivalent to the old cpu_reset(). ASSERT_LINE resets the cpu and halts it. CLEAR_LINE restarts it. This avoids the need to call cpu_halt() in most cases [Nicola Salmoria].
- 0.35b10            : Removed src\types.h.
- 0.35b7             : Major overhaul to the CPU cores. Note that the debugger doesn't work in this release [Juergen Buchmueller].
- 0.35b6             : Major changes to the whole CPU interface and cores [Juergen Buchmueller]. Note: The CPU cores have been completely torn apart and rearranged in this release. Don't be surprised if a large number of games donì't work at all. For example, Twin Cobra doesn't boot, and most (all?) of the games using a 6803 lock up (ctrl-alt-del needed).
-  2nd March     1999: Eric Hustvedt updated the CPU interface, resulting in a little speed boost.
- 0.35b2             : The CPU cores are still in a state of flux. Most of the problems in 0.35b1 have been fixed, however some still remain (e.g. Gauntlet doesn't accept coins and Exterminator crashes).
- 0.35b1             : New CPU interrupt system. The functions cpu_set_irq_line() and cpu_set_nmi_line() can be used to precisely control the status of the CPU physical lines, instead of using the limited control granted by cpu_cause_interrupt() [Juergen Buchmueller]. Nicola Salmoria added a horrible dirty hack to allow opcode encryption on CPUs other than the main one. It's really ugly and needs a rewrite, but it's enough to get sound in Pocket Gal and The Real Ghostbusters.
- 0.31               : New function: cpu_setOPbaseoverride(). This function is called whenever the code jumps into an area of memory that is in a different bank than the current one (i.e., the code jumps from RAM to BANK1). It takes the destination PC as a parameter and returns a new PC which is to be used to determine which bank to switch to by the standard function. The main purpose of adding this is for slapstic coding.  Empire Strikes Back and at least one of the System 1 games jumps to code in the slapstic memory region, but since we read the opcodes directly out of ROM, we never call the read handler.  Although this won't solve the problem completely, we can at least detect when the code jumps into the slapstic memory region, and based on the registers and the PC, cause the proper bank switching to occur [Aaron Giles].
- 0.30               : Aaron Giles redesigned cpuintrf.c to be more modular and readable. Added a cpu_reset() call so that a single processor can be reset during execution; Gauntlet needs this to work properly. cpu_setbankhandler_r() / cpu_setbankhandler_w() for better bank switching support. The Williams drivers take advantage of it [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- 0.29               : Moved the memory code from cpuintrf.c to memory.c [Tatsuyuki Satoh, Aaron Giles]. CPU execution is interleaved. The cpu_slices_per_frame field in the MachineDriver controls how often control is passed from one CPU to another. 1 is the minimum, meaning that each CPU runs for the whole video frame before giving control to the others. The higher this setting, the more closely CPUs are interleaved and therefore the more accurate the emulation is. However, an higher setting also means slower performance [Nicola Salmoria].
- 0.27               : New support functions in cpuintrf.c [Nicola Salmoria]: cpu_getfcount(), which returns the number of CPU cycles till the end of the current video frame (as opposed to cpu_geticount(), which  returns the number of CPU cycles till the next call of the interrupt handler) cpu_getiloops(), which returns the number of times the interrupt handler will be called before the end of the video frame (useful in interrupt handlers). cpu_gettotalcycles(), which returns the total number of CPU cycles passed since the CPU was reset. ignore_interrupt(), companion to interrupt() and nmi_interrupt(). This allows interrupt handlers to be cpu-independant, avoiding use of CPU-specific interrupt indetifiers.
- 0.22               : Rick Wirch proposed a better optimization to cpu_readmem and cpu_writemem. Speed results are good under DOS and Windows. Source: Changed CPUIntrf regarding readmem/writemem optimizations.
- 0.21               : Added M6809 CPU support. Changes in cpuintrf.c and driver.h to accommodate the new CPU. The first driver working on this CPU is Super Pac Man. The driver is based on the super-detailed KEG file of Replay emulator by Kevin Brisley.
- 0.20               : New flag for the cpu type [Nicola Salmoria]: CPU_AUDIO_CPU. For example, you'll define a CPU type as CPU_Z80 | CPU_AUDIO_CPU. This indicates that the CPU is a slave used for audio only, and is therefore not needed if sound is disabled. The CPU will not be emulated when sound is turned off, therefore speeding  up the emulation a lot.
- 0.19               : Added input ports 5 and 6 in CPUINTRF module.
- 0.16               : Added src\types.h. Nicola Salmoria finally took the time to change Z80.h/M6502.h to make them work together. This allowed me to remove some kludges in cpuintrf.c. I also added some new functions, which can be used regardless of the CPU type: cpu_getpc(), cpu_geticount(), cpu_seticount().
- 0.12               : Multiple CPU support [Nicola Salmoria]. All you have to do to setup multiple CPUs is add entries to the cpu[] array in the MachineDriver definition. Each CPU can have different type (currently Z80 and M6502 are supported), clock, address space, memory/IO port hook, interrupt handlers, number of interrupts per video frame. Sound support in Burger Time. This is the first multiple CPU game supported by MAME (two 6502, one for code, one for sound). It's not perfect, but we're getting there. Also, as you can guess, this is slow. A 486/100 cannot handle it at 60 fps. Runs reasonably with -frameskip 1, though. I also set up the second CPU to emulate sound in Scramble, but the sound that comes out is completely wrong. I don't know what I'm missing, anyone can help?
- 0.10               : Added cpuintrf.c/h.
- 0.09               : Some changes to the MachineDriver definition and mame.c needed to support multiple CPUs (they are NOT supported yet - this is just the first step) [Nicola Salmoria].



1.    Zilog

1.1   Z80

- 0.184              : Removed tag() argument from logerror() calls in Z80 cpu [shattered].
- 0.182              : Reconfigure Z80 daisy chain behavior to use the standard vector for an external IRQ, rather than a bogus one from the last device in the chain. Enabled Z80 daisy chain on Cedar Magnet sound board (fake IRQ still necessary, though vectors are correct now). Source note regarding IM 2 behavior contrary to Zilog datasheet (was fixed way back in 0.35b11). Simplify daisy-chain IRQ ack routine (get rid of delegate member) (cpu\z80\z80daisy.cpp) [AJR].
- 0.180              : Changed the Z80 disassembler to use 'std::ostream &' internally [Nathan Woods].
- 0.179              : Fixed disassembly window updating when you set pc/curpc on Z80 [smf].
- 0.173              : Make the Z80/Z180 daisy chain an interface that interfaces with the existing interface. Removed leftover MCFG_SEGAZ80_SET_DECRYPTED_TAG from macros in system1.cpp, which lets all drivers validate without crashing [AJR].
- 0.171              : Added a debug mechanism for /WAIT pin assertion mechanism (enable with STALLS_ON_WAIT_ASSERT in CPU core), and hooked it up to Night Gal driver as a quick example [Angelo Salese]. Added crude implementation of WAIT pin. Put take_nmi in the execution loop, eg. z80 writes to another device NMI enable register. Removed obsolete irq_line write handler [hap].
- 0.168              : Start of an (MESS) ZX80/81 hardware-correct rewrite: Added irqack to Z80 CPU [O. Galibert].
- 0.154              : Shortened CALLBACK to CB (cpu\z80\z80.h) [hap].
- 0.153              : Converted Z80 to C++. Fixed Z80 regression and Z80 related regressions (MESS: includes\abc80x.h, aquarius.h, c128.h and pcw16.h). Renamed functions with upper case names to lower case to avoid #define collisions [smf].
- 0.152              : Removed logerror("z80daisy_call_ack_device: failed to find an device to ack!"). (MESS) Fixed fast controller Z80 daisy chain, formatting a disk works now except for a not ready status after the last track (bus\abcbus\lux21046.c) [Curt Coder].
- 0.147u2            : hap fixed Z80 cycles on illegal prefixes.
- 0.147              : Get rid of old speedup hack (besides, it made halt timing inaccurate on drivers with custom cycletables) [hap].
- 0.146u1            : hap fixed Z80 t-state table for dd/fd opcodes, the 'illegal' ones were especially wrong, all taking 4 t-states.
-  5th September 2011: Charles MacDonald - Free Kick dumped: I ran Free Kick in single-step mode up until a point where the stack pointer was initialized to a known value, than triggered repeated NMIs to push the stack pointer down past zero, wrapping around the address space into the external memory area. This is the only place where activity on the Z80 bus can be monitored. The NMI routine was allowed to finish instead of being interrupted again. At a point where it calls a leaf function, the return address was modified to point to a fragment of the IRQ handler which pops several registers off the stack before returning. This let BC, DE, and HL to be set to user-specified values, followed by another modified return address that pointed to a single LDIR instruction. A block transfer was performed that copied the internal RAM data to the external memory area in 4K chunks, and the process was automated to dump the entire content of security module correctly. It's satisfying to have this game dumped after working on it for quite some time, and this outcome certainly justified the time spent developing the Z80 analysis board. Here's hoping Counter Run can be dumped in a similar way. Does anyone have an original (non-bootleg) version of Counter Run they could lend for attempted dumping?
- 23rd August    2011: Charles MacDonald - One of the coolest things created to assist emulation was Dave Widel's application of using a I/O card to control a custom Z80 to identify instructions and find the correlation between encrypted opcode/data bytes and their decrypted value. I've been continuing research on the Z80-based Free Kick / Counter Run security module and I wanted to add similar functionality into a new board designed to facilitate analysis of these modules. This board connects the expansion port of the Rev. 4 PAL dumper and has sockets for regular 40-pin Z80s and the 52-pin security modules. It has three operating modes: Static clock: The user controls the clock input and can assert any inputs and monitor outputs. Single step: Like above, but the CPU runs at full speed and automatically enters a wait state for all bus cycles. Bus request: CPU gives up ownership of the bus and the internal memory and I/O spaces can be probed. The two dead Free Kick modules work as expected despite having corrupted program code in the internal RAM, I can observe what they do for each clock cycle or bus cycle, though they don't do much. For some reason the one working module doesn't seem to operate reliably in the analysis board, but works fine on the real thing. I guess more testing is necessary. Using the bus request feature didn't allow access to the internal RAMs, but it was highly likely they'd disable the read/write strobes to prevent that kind of attack. Regular Z80s and custom 40-pin ones (Top Roller, MC8123, Kabuki) all work fine, though there isn't a pressing need to work on those parts. The Counter Run bootlegs seem to come from the same source. One set is extensively modified to work with the bootleg hardware, the others have a protection check disabled (a 3-bit latch mapped to an I/O port inside the security module) and a checksum test that is bypassed. I guess they were too lazy to calculate a correct checksum. What's really interesting is that the bootleg ROM is a dump of the entire internal Z80 address space and includes the work RAM which isn't necessary or even utilized. The work RAM has a factory default high score list (no initials from the bootleggers), a sprite list and other variables, the Z80 stack contents (likely ruling out a HD647180), and even the original correct checksum result. This means the bootleggers were able to take control of the module at some point during normal operation, perhaps during the attract sequence. I want to say there should be an easy way in, but I don't know what it is yet.
- 0.143              : Curt Coder added BUSRQ and WAIT input lines to the Z80 CPU core.
- 0.141u1            : Allow Z80 daisy chain functionality to be used in a situation where there are more interrupt sources besides the daisy chain devices [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.139u2            : Phil Bennett set Z80 IFF1 and IFF2 to 0 on a reset.
- 0.138u2            : Defined a new custom interface for the Z80 daisy chain. This interface behaves like the standard interfaces, and can be added to any device that implements the Z80 daisy chain behavior. Converted all existing Z80 daisy chain devices to new-style devices that inherit this interface [Aaron Giles].
- 0.138u1            : Added NSC800 CPU emulation to the Z80 core [Sandro Ronco].
- 0.135u1            : Dirk Best added a check for NOP in Z80 interrupt mode 0. This allows code like ei / halt / di to work correctly. A better solution would be to implement full support for arbitrary opcodes in mode 0. Curt Coder refactored Z80 to use DEVCB.
- 0.133u4            : Eke fixed IM2 interrupt cycles in the Z80 core.
- 0.133u3            : Z80 changes [hap]: Fixed X/Y flags in CCF/SCF/BIT, ZEXALL is happy now. Simplified DAA, renamed MEMPTR (3.8) to WZ (same temp register as the officially named WZ in the 8080), added TODO.
- 0.132              : Marshmellow fixed minor cycle counting inaccuracy in Z80 core.
- 0.131u1            : Xander Xander fixed bug when setting breakpoints on Z80 CPUs at addresses A-F.
- 0.130u4            : Aaron Giles corrected System 1 Z80 clocking: Each opcode fetch is 2 cycles with /M1 low, so each byte of opcode fetching causes slightly longer delays than the previous tables. Implemented approximate wait state timing for videoram access; further accuracy will rely on getting a dump of the PAL16R4 that controls the horizontal video timing.
- 0.130u3            : Aaron Giles changed Z80 cycle table definitions to be per-device. Removed old set_info constants for the tables; they are now set up via the z80_set_cycle_tables function.
- 0.128u7            : Aaron Giles added the concept of a cpu_state_table, which is supplied by the CPU cores and which describes all the register state accessible to the debugger and other subsystems. The format of the table is such that most data can be simply fetched from memory without the further involvement of the CPU core, including the display of common formats. Extensibility points are available for custom display and for importing/exporting the data to intermediate variables for more complicated scenarios. Updated the Z80 core to use this.
- 0.128u4            : Aaron Giles cleaned up macro mess in the Z80 core. Switched to using generic memory calls instead of program_* and io_*.
- 0.128u3            : Miodrag Milanovic added support for recently-discovered internal Z80 register to the Z80 core. Improves accuracy of undefined flags. Aaron Giles converted the Z80 core to reference their data via pointers instead of global structs, in anticipation of future changes. Aaron Giles updated cpuexec to compute the "perfect" interleave value taking into account the minimum number of cycles per instruction specified by the CPU core. Updated Z80 core to indicate that the minimum cpi is 2.
- 0.127u7            : Aaron Giles made the Z80 daisy chain aware of referencing device-specific devices. Aaron Giles added new functions for building device-relative tags. Changed machine configuration builder to use these functions. Also changed the laserdisc player devices to use them. Updated Z80 CTC/SIO code to assume that the CPU provided for the clock is relative to the device that the CTC/SIO belong to. Updated memory code to assume that regions and devices referenced by the memory map are relative to the device the associated CPU belongs to.
- 0.127u6            : Aaron Giles changed Z80 daisy chain interface to simply be a list of devices in the chain. Interrupt callback functions are now fetched via the standard device interface and referenced by the daisy chain code.
- 0.122u2            : Barry Rodewald removed the increasing of the R register from each IX/IY related (FD xx or DD xx) instruction on the Z80. According to documentation and the behavior of the Amstrad CPC driver, this is incorrect.
- 0.115              : Aaron Giles fixed Z80 IRQ which broke YM2203 sound in the Capcom games (gng, commando, gunsmoke, 1943, sidearms) in 0.111u5.
- 0.114u3            : Removed cpu\z80\z80dasm.h.
- 0.112              : David Haywood fixed broken games due to Z80 update (peedspn.c, calorie.c, talbot.c, portrait.c, merit.c, couple.c and onetwo.c).
- 0.111u5            : Rewrote Z80 interrupt handling to avoid a bad bug in the post-EI interrupt signalling [Aaron Giles].
- 0.104u1            : Removed machine\z80fmly.c/h. Aaron Giles separated various Z80 peripherals (CTC, PIO) into separate modules. Added SIO module, hooked it up to NFL Football. Still no visible progress.
- 0.104              : Made 8-bit A,B,C,D,E,H and L registers available in the Z80 debugger [Nicola Salmoria, Aaron Giles].
- 0.101u2            : Frank Palazzolo fixed Z80 behavior on cold versus warm reset.
- 0.98u3             : Aaron Giles added step in/out support to the Z80 disassembler.
- 0.98u2             : Added cpu\z80\z80daisy.c/h. Aaron Giles rewroted the Z80/Z180 daisy chaining logic to work a little closer to the hardware. Updated the Z80 CTC module to support the new model. Changed the CTC module to not generate interrupts if there is an outstanding request on the same timer is currently in service; this allows Journey to (finally) run with the correct CPU speed.
-  2nd July      2005: Dave Widel - Did some tests to see how accurate MAME is for initializing the Z80. Long story short MAME's only getting 2 registers right, PC and I. So far I've tried 5 different Z80's with the same results. AF,BC,DE,HL,IX,IY,SP,AF',BC',DE',HL',R are all initialized incorrectly. Technically I guess I'm not sure about R, it's either initialized or used incorrectly. The upper right is the registers at boot (see screenshot). It should be full of garbage. except for RI which should be 1300. Lower right is after filling all regs with FF and resetting. It should be all FF except RI=1300. Lower left is all 00 except R=13. The Z80's tested were 2 Zilogs, 1 SGS, 1 Sharp, 1 NEC. Z80's don't work correctly when booted they have to be reset so when I say booted, I'm assuming it's after the first reset. I don't know what the values are at boot. I would guess none of the registers including the pc are set at boot.

- 0.82u1             : Juergen Buchmueller fixed Z80 RETN / RETI cycle counts.
- 0.79u2             : Nathan Woods patched the Z80 CPU core to set the Z80 cycle tables to their defaults on startup. This removes any need for drivers to reset the Z80 cycle tables back to their defaults on exit.
- 0.77u3             : Nathan Woods added osd_die() function; a friendlier way to die in some unexpected fatal way than exit(-1) or [shudder] raise(SIGABRT).
- 0.77u2             : Found the way the OTIR/INIR instructions affect the PF flag and removed the Z80 look-up tables [Ramsoft, Sean Young].
- 0.77               : Removed cpu\z80\z80daa.h. Sean Young and Stefano improved Z80 DAA emulation allowing removal of look-up table (cpu\z80\z80daa.h). Credit for the Z80 DAA emulation improvement goes to 'Ramsoft' ( http://www.ramsoft.bbk.org/).

- 12th February  1999: Juergen Buchmueller has made the ASM Z80 core even better. Speed improvements range from 25% (Galaga) to 45% (Tapper). It's still far from complete, and daisy-chaining doesn't work.
-  6th February  1999: Juergen Buchmueller has made a preliminary x86 assembler Z80 core for MAME. Currently not many games work, but it shows an enhancement of about 20% in the speed.
- 0.35b2             : Removed z80\asm.bat.
- 0.35b1             : Added z80\asm.bat. Removed z80\z80codes.h, z80debug.c, z80io.h, z80cdx86.h, makefile and readme.txt. New Z80 emulator [Juergen Buchmueller].

- 0.31               : Support for Z80 daisy chain interrupts [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- 0.30               : Removed z80\z80.txt.
- 0.29               : Aligned to version 1.2 of Marcel de Kogel's Z80 emulator. New memory handling functions, about 10%-30% faster than before. Moved the memory code from cpuintrf.c to memory.c. Banked ROMs can now be handled in a cleaner and faster way. Use the new MRA_BANK1... types in the memory handler arrays, and cpu_setbank() to set the current bank. The Z80 and M6809 emulators natively support bank switching. IMPORTANT: For 24 bit addressing (i.e. 68000) you cannot associate a memory handler to a single byte. You must use four consecutive bytes, longword aligned. This was done to speedup word (2 bytes) and dword (4 bytes) operations [Tatsuyuki Satoh, Aaron Giles].
- 0.27               : Added machine\z80fmly.c/h.
- 0.21               : Nicola Salmoria introduced changes to the Z80 emulator code that intercept some sorts of tight loop used during an interrupt waitstate. Normal games should not be affected, while Galaga and 1942 are now very fast!!
- 0.16               : Nicola Salmoria finally took the time to change Z80.h/M6502.h to make them work together. This allowed me to remove some kludges in cpuintrf.c. I also added some new functions, which can be used regardless of the CPU type: cpu_getpc(), cpu_geticount(), cpu_seticount().
- 0.12               : Source: Multiple CPU support. All you have to do to setup multiple CPUs is add entries to the cpu[] array in the MachineDriver definition. Each CPU can have different type (currently Z80 and M6502 are supported), clock, address space, memory/IO port hook, interrupt handlers, number of interrupts per video frame. Sometimes interrupt requests happen while interrupts are disabled. Until now I just ignored them, but some games need them to be processed as soon as interrupts are reenabled. Rally X is an example of such a game. The Z80 engine has provision to do that, but it would make writing a driver more complex (need to find the interrupt acknowledge register) so I slightly modified the engine to automatically cache an interrupt request and execute it as soon as interrupts are enabled.
- 0.04               : Changed daa.h to z80\z80daa.h. Use version 1.1 of Z80Em by Marcel de Kogel. Faster! (note that I had to make a couple of changes to Z80.c to make Crazy Climber work) [Nicola Salmoria].
- 0.01               : Added z80\z80.c/h, z80codes.h, z80dasm.c/h, z80debug.c, z80io.h, z80cdx86.h and daa.h. Z80Em Portable Zilog Z80 Emulator Copyright (C) Marcel de Kogel 1996,1997.

- 0.146u5            : Removed legacy Z80 CTC interfaces. Removed Star Force sound hack in favor of just driving a DAC directly with the CTC output line (MAME can handle sound frequency timers no problem). Removed NOTIMER hack from Z80 CTC interface (Star Force was the only one using it). The first parameter of the interface struct is now gone (machine\ldv1000.c, machine\z80ctc.c, machine\z80ctc.h, audio\cchasm.c, audio\cinemat.c, audio\senjyo.c, drivers\astrocde.c, drivers\cchasm.c, drivers\csplayh5.c, drivers\dlair.c, drivers\jankenmn.c, drivers\mcr.c, drivers\mcr3.c, drivers\nbmj9195.c, drivers\niyanpai.c, drivers\pipeline.c, drivers\proconn.c, drivers\senjyo.c, includes\cchasm.h, includes\senjyo.h, machine\mcr.c) [Angelo Salese].

- 0.129u6            : Another round of static/const qualifier additions, plus a rename of has_addon_chip to snes_has_addon_chip. Notably a number of z80ctc_interface are now const (devicification must have removed the cases where it was dynamically modified) [Atari Ace].
- 0.127u7            : Aaron Giles made the Z80 daisy chain aware of referencing device-specific devices. Aaron Giles added new functions for building device-relative tags. Changed machine configuration builder to use these functions. Also changed the laserdisc player devices to use them. Updated Z80 CTC/SIO code to assume that the CPU provided for the clock is relative to the device that the CTC/SIO belong to.

- 0.98u2             : Added cpu\z80\z80daisy.c. Aaron Giles rewroted the Z80/Z180 daisy chaining logic to work a little closer to the hardware. Updated the Z80 CTC and PIO modules to support the new model. Changed the CTC module to not generate interrupts if there is an outstanding request on the same timer is currently in service; this allows Journey to (finally) run with the correct CPU speed.
- 16th July      1999: Mathis Rosenhauer sent in a Cosmic Chasm driver with much better Z80CTC sound.
- 0.28               : Aaron Giles perfected the CTC emulation, needed by the MCR driver.

- 0.139u4            : Curt Coder modified Z80-DMA reset command (C3) to not randomly clear registers.
- 0.139u1            : Z80 DMA changes [Curt Coder]: Fixed DMA by re-adding a status update call to ENABLE DMA command. Allowed illegal mode 0 DMA operation since trs80m2 in MESS is abusing this. Fixed ready signal handling by adding a check for ready condition on each byte.
- 0.137u1            : Curt Coder fixed Z80-DMA Load and Continue commands.
- 0.137              : Curt Coder fixed Z80 DMA ready signal handling.

- 0.123u4            : Changed Z80DMA to new device interface, updated mario.c and dkong.c to use new interface. Illustrates how to keep existing memory read/write handlers. This is slower than caching the device interface, but does not have an impact on devices accessed at a low frequency like in this case [Couriersud].
- 0.122u5            : Couriersud hooked up Z80 DMA to Mario Bros.
- 0.122u4            : Added machine\z80dma.c/h. Added Z80 DMA chip [Couriersud]: Only implements intelligence to emulate dkong3.

1.13  Z80 DART

- 0.186              : Improved encapsulation of Z80DART channels [Vas Crabb].
- 0.181              : Set the vector status bits to 1 at eoi [Carl]. Only update serial line configuration if it actually changes. Allows the apricot serial port to work correctly [Dirk Best].
- 0.180              : Finalized conversion to use util::fifo. Refactored FIFOs using new template based FIFO class [Joakim Larsson Edstrom].
- 0.163              : Added direct control/data access functions to Z80DART [Dirk Best].
- 0.158              : Save diserial state in Z80DART, fixes (MESS) Bondwell 12/14 SIO test error after loading a state [Osso].
- 0.154              : Fixed usage of uninitialized member in z80dart_channel [Oliver Stöneberg]. Quick fix to get (MESS CPC) CP/M to detect the presence of the serial interface [Brian Troha]. Converted Z80DART to use DEVCB2 [Fabio Priuli].
- 0.153              : Added Z80DART priority and irq vector for 8274 (needed for MESS: Intel iSBC 286) [Carl]. Sets Z80DART RR1_ALL_SENT on reset, previously it relied on tra_complete() being called after reset. It's no longer called if there has been no data sent. It makes more sense to mask out the errors that are going to be brought in from the error mask rather than throw all the other bits away. However I haven't seen any documentation for Z80DART that says there is an error FIFO at all. Fixed Z80DART parity selection. Removed hack from (MESS) Little Big Board (Pulsar) and hooked up Z80DART now that parity works. Call set_data_frame() before stc_rcv_rate() in Z80 DART, as since r26274 there is random behaviour if you don't [smf]. Fixed Z80DART array out of bounds access [hap].
- 0.152              : Removed logerrors ("z80dart_irq_ack: failed to find an interrupt to ack!") and ("z80dart_irq_reti: failed to find an interrupt to clear IEO on!") [Curt Coder]. Replaced read rx callback in Z80DART (and clones) with a write handler, which allows multiple chips to be connected together without using glue methods [smf].
- 0.149              : Merged uPD7201 in Z80 DART and modernized the interface. (MESS) Refactored drivers to use z80dart.c instead of z80sio.c, the easy part. Refactored dart_channel to be of device_t kin. Refactored z80dart_channel to implement device_serial_interface. Cleanup driver. (MESS) superslv regression: Fixed Z80 DART [Curt Coder].

- 0.141u4            : Curt Coder fixed Z80-DART transmit word length.
- 0.141              : Z80DART driver [Wilbert Pol]: The channel B modified interrupt vector can be read immediately after setting it. Reading from a read register other than 0 also masks out the register index.
- 0.140u3            : Z80DART changes [Curt Coder]: Fixed asynchronous transmit mode. Fixed channel A interrupt vector. Improved logging.
- 0.139u2            : Expanded the Z80-DART interface to allow future implementation of Z80-SIO features [Curt Coder]: Added separate clock inputs for channel B.

- 0.127u6            : Aaron Giles changed Z80 PIO interrupt callback to pass a device instead of the machine. All device callbacks should provide the device.
- 0.123u3            : One-line fix for the Z80PIO. At the moment when the interrupt control word is sent (with interrupts enabled), an interrupt occurs. In reality, interrupts are disabled until the interrupt mask byte is sent [Robert].
- 0.105u1            : Fixed the Z80 PIO code to prevent an interrupt to occur between the PIO_OP_MODE byte and mask which follows. According to the datasheet, this is not permitted in hardware [Robert].
- 0.104u1            : Added machine\z80pio.c/h. Removed machine\z80fmly.c. Aaron Giles separated various Z80 peripherals (CTC, PIO) into separate modules.
- 0.98u2             : Added cpu\z80\z80daisy.c. Aaron Giles rewroted the Z80/Z180 daisy chaining logic to work a little closer to the hardware. Updated the Z80 PIO module to support the new model.

2.1   M6502

- 0.189              : Corrected cycle counts for undocumented $BF instruction (om6502.lst). Note: Passes now the Lorenz testsuite-2.15's cputiming.prg and does not break laxay.prg. Ref: NMOS 6510 Unintended Opcodes no more secrets (v0.91 - 24/12/16) http://csdb.dk/release/?id=152327 page 14 ($BF) cycles = 3 to read and 4+1 if page boundary [plgDavid].

- 0.160              : Removed except clause syntax not supported on Python 3. This change uses sys.exc_info()[1] instead of the "as" syntax to retain Python 2.5 compatibility (cpu\h8\m6502make.py) [Mike Naberezny]. Fixed icounting (m6502\m6502make.py) [Peter Ferrie].
- 0.159              : Fixed inline helpers (m6502\m6502.h), does that break (MESS) C65? [O. Galibert].
- 0.154              : Compile-time disable now the slow attotime precalculation/caching at start of each timeslice. This precalculation seems to be part of OG's "CPU core template", as all CPU cores written by him do it. It's used to optimize things like onboard serial ports and high-frequency timers; however, the M6502 and its derivatives have neither onboard serial ports nor high-frequency timers, and the precalculation is simply a boat anchor on drivers with 6502-family CPUs and tight interleaving. (MESS) Added MCFG_M6502_DISABLE_DIRECT (address decoding is 100% dynamic, no RAM/ROM banks) to all Commodore 8bit drivers [Alex Jackson].
- 0.153              : Expose SYNC pin through DEVCB2 in M6502 for more flexibility. Not everyone calls the base device_start, but they do call the base init(). Fixed missing semicolon. Fixed some unofficial opcodes. The 6510 version of lxa may be wrong in the same way (on 6502 it loads A and X with the immediate value, no AND occurs), someone C= savvy please check [R. Belmont].

Wilbert Pol improved accuracy of 6502 CPU cores (DECO CPU16, M4510, M6502, M6509, M6510, M6510T, M65C02, M65SC02 and N2A03) to implement the read/write that happens on every cycle. Moved the "undocumented" instructions from the 6510 cores into the main 6502 core, since there were several other versions of the 6502 cores which have the same undocumented instructions. Removed some of the #define override magic that was going on to make the code easier to read and understand.

- 0.34b4             : Removed m6502\codes.h, makefile, dasm.c and tables.h.
- 18th April     1999: Aaron Giles modified the 6502 core to fix Indiana Jones, and changed the Atari System 1 drivers to decode certain graphics data from PROMs instead of hard-coded variables.
- 0.34b2             : Added m6502\m6502ops.h, tbl6502.c, tbl6510.c and tbl65c02.c. Juergen Buchmueller replaced the 6502 emulator with a new one which also supports 65C02 and 6510. Marat Fayzullin's core is no longer used.
- 0.33b2             : Christophe Verre fixed a bug in 6502/dasm.c (this only applies if you compile it to get a standalone disassembler - it is not part of MAME).
- 0.33b1             : Changed the 6502 emulation to disable interrupts on a reset. Not sure if this is the correct behaviour, but Centipede needed it for the service mode to work.
- 0.30               : Added m6502\6502dasm.c. Removed m6502\debug.c. The 6502 supports bank switching via cpu_setbank() [Aaron Giles].
- 0.27               : Bernd Wiebelt sincerely hopes he fixed the BCD-emulation in the 6502 emulation. At least the authentic Tempest feeling (broken X/Y monitor) is gone, since the game now starts without pressing Fire. New macro ROM_RELOAD(), meaning to reload the previous ROM at a different address (useful with 6502 games which need reset/irq vectors at FFFx).
- 0.16               : Nicola Salmoria finally took the time to change Z80.h/M6502.h to make them work together. This allowed me to remove some kludges in cpuintrf.c. I also added some new functions, which can be used regardless of the CPU type: cpu_getpc(), cpu_geticount(), cpu_seticount(). Fixed a couple of bugs in M6502 BCD arithmetic. One of them was causing the pepper counter in Burger Time to behave strangely.
- 0.14               : Nicola Salmoria fixed bug which sometimes caused 6502 games not to run (actually they did run, but interrupts didn't happen).
- 0.13               : Use latest version of Marat's 6502 engine [Nicola Salmoria].
- 0.12               : Source: Multiple CPU support. All you have to do to setup multiple CPUs is add entries to the cpu[] array in the MachineDriver definition. Each CPU can have different type (currently Z80 and M6502 are supported), clock, address space, memory/IO port hook, interrupt handlers, number of interrupts per video frame. Nicola had already done a similar change to the 6502 engine, it was needed by Burger Time which wouldn't accept coins otherwise. Burger Time is the first multiple CPU game supported by MAME (two 6502, one for code, one for sound).
- 0.10               : Added m6502\m6502.c/h, codes.h, tables.h, dasm.c, debug.c and makefile. Support for 6502 CPU. From a driver writer point of view, it is used just like the Z80, the only difference being that you have to specify CPU_M6502 instead of CPU_Z80 in the MachineDriver definition. Multiple CPUs are still NOT supported. Centipede is the first and Nibbler is the second 6502 game supported by MAME. Nicola currently using the M6502 Emulator (1996) by Marat Fayzullin & Alex Krasivsky. The version used in MAME is slightly modified.

- 0.128u1            : Phill Harvey-Smith fixed a subtle bug in the 65c02 emulation where the result of the BIT instruction differs on the 65c02 (from the 6502), when executed in immediate mode.
- 0.124u4            : Roberto Fresca fixed the 6502 family of disassemblers to show the correct bit to operate for BBR, BBS, RMB and SMB instructions (65C02/65CE02 CPUs and variants).

Fixed random crash while drawing characters at the screen borders. draw_char_40 & draw_char_80 : use of std::min. Fixed invalid instructions length. Each 6800 invalid opcodes have a different behavior. This commit fix the PC increment of each invalid opcode execution. There is three groups of invalid opcodes: One byte invalid opcodes/instructions: 00,02,03,04,05,12,13,15,18,1A,1C,1D,1E,1F,21, 38,3A,3C,3D,41,42,45,4B,4E,51,52,55,5B and 5E.

Behavior checked from the Visual 6800 and the real hardware (goupil computer) http://www.visual6502.org/JSSim/expert-6800.html. Invalid opcodes renamed [Jean-Francois DEL NERO]. Quick and dirty split of most MC6801/MC6803/HD63701 features from base M6800 class. The code remains generally archaic and awful and in need of a sweeping rewrite. At least one static variable is no more [AJR].

- 0.176              : Removed irq_line methods from M6800 and replace uses with DEVCB_INPUTLINE. Added several aliases for M6800_IRQ_LINE [AJR].
- 0.175              : Fixed behaviour of N and V flags in CPX (compare X) instruction (cpu\m6800\6800ops.hxx). These two flags are only affected by the data comparison of the upper 8 bits, and not the whole 16 bits [Quench].
- 0.174              : Changed cpu\m6800\6800ops.inc and 6800tbl.inc to 6800ops.hxx and 6800tbl.hxx.

- 0.147u3            : Workaround for Coleco Adam not booting. The free-running counter values are unacceptable, so let it read from the output compare register instead. To be fixed properly later [Curt Coder].
- 0.147u1            : Removed AS_DATA on all M6800 variants and AS_IO on CPU variants not having IO lines [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.146u4            : David Haywood added HD6303Y subtype to 6800 core so that I can correctly define the CPU type in the drivers (it's kinda important because the different types have different internal peripherals, so even if I don't emulate them yet we shouldn't misrepresent it in the drivers). Oliver Stöneberg fixed assertion with new m6800 CPU types.
- 0.141u3            : Curt Coder added HD6301 subtype to the M6800 CPU core.

3.2   M6801

- 0.186              : Added cpu\m6800\m6801.cpp/h. Quick and dirty split of most MC6801/MC6803/HD63701 features from base M6800 class. The code remains generally archaic and awful and in need of a sweeping rewrite. At least one static variable is no more [AJR].
- 0.150              : Modernized M6800 cpu core [Wilbert Pol]. MC6801/6803 updates [R. Belmont]: Support for timer output capture to pin P21. Support for externally-clocked serial. Added DEVCB2 hook for serial xmit to easily differentiate xmit from other Port 2 updates. Bits are still also sent to Port 2 of course.
- 0.141u1            : M6801 changes [Curt Coder]: Added operating mode enum. Fixed port writes. Implemented SCI status follower bits. Implemented port 3 strobed mode. Fixed port writes some more.
-  5th August    2006: Nicola Salmoria - Excellent work by Trinity, the original MCU ROM has been extracted. This required removing the cover from the chip, taking photographs of it under a microscope and manually decoding the contents of the ROM bit by bit. The photo shown in the previous post confirms that it's in the 6801 class, not a 68701 however as it was conjectured, but a 6801U4. With this ROM, we finally have the final piece of the puzzle for a 100% guaranteed perfect emulation. Checking the original MCU program was very interesting. It was designed to provide many protection features that were eventually not used by the game, like: * Process coin inputs and update the credit counter * Handle the number of remaining lives for both players * Handle the current round number * Handle variable speed incrementing for four variables and * Return values from a 1280 bytes table of seemingly random data. The reasons why those features were not used are probably various. Some of them were probably awkward to use because they require to one one frame for the MCU to process the data, others weren't flexible enough like the coin input processing that wouldn't allow for coinage settings different from the ones hardcoded in the MCU (though versions of Bubble Bobble with different coinage settings don't seem to have been made anyway).
-  4th August    2006: Dave Widel - Good news for Bubble Bobble fans. It seems someone named Trinity has dumped the MCU. Apparently by decapping the chip, photographing it through a microscope and transposing the pic into binary form. Hopefully this will enable some boards to be repaired.
-  3rd August    2006: Nicola Salmoria - What's inside the TAITO JPH1011P MCU? ... It's a MC6801U4 TM7 © 1982. More on this later.
- 0.90               : Nicola Salmoria updated the Bubble Bobble driver. Removed the 68705 CPU emulation, since that's not what the original used, simulated the 68701 MCU (enemy movement should now be correct), fixed clock item behaviour (now enemies start moving again after 10 seconds), supported coin lockout and emulated the boblbobl protection device (getting rid of the ROM patches).

- 0.148              : Fixed S11 timer IRQ to main CPU. Corrected main CPU type to M6802 (fixes factory setting display on first boot).
- 0.130u3            : Track & Field cleanups [Aaron Giles]: Derived clocks where possible. Complete memory maps from the schematics. Hooked up proper sound command latching. Reimplemented 6802-based ADPCM samples for the bootlegs. Merged memory maps. Extended NVRAM to the full RAM range (according to schematics). Created common include file and modified drivers to use it instead of explicit externs.
- 0.122u7            : Aaron Giles added internal divider on m680* series CPUs (except the original m6800). Updated clocks on all games using them to remove the explicit divider.

3.4   M6803

- 0.186              : Quick and dirty split of most MC6801/MC6803/HD63701 features from base M6800 class. The code remains generally archaic and awful and in need of a sweeping rewrite. At least one static variable is no more [AJR].
- 0.150              : Modernized M6800 cpu core [Wilbert Pol]. MC6801/6803 updates [R. Belmont]: Support for timer output capture to pin P21. Support for externally-clocked serial.

- 0.37b1             : 6803/63701 external port writes no longer set to 1 the bits that are set as inputs in the DDR register. Instead, they are set to the value returned by a read from the port [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- 0.36b8             : Tatsuyuki Satoh finally fixed the CMPX instruction in the 680x core. On the 6800 it does not affect the C flag, on the others (6803, 63701) it does.
- 0.35b6             : Note: The CPU cores have been completely torn apart and rearranged in this release. Don't be surprised if a large number of games donì't work at all. For example, Twin Cobra doesn't boot, and most (all?) of the games using a 6803 lock up (ctrl-alt-del needed).

- 0.155              : Fixed CWAI implementation in base6x09.ops doesn't acknowledge interrupts while polling for systems using M6809 with M6809_HOLD_LINE (MT#05350). Note: CPU cores *must* call standard_irq_callback() when taking an interrupt. No ifs, no buts, Not only HOLD_LINE relies on it, but more importantly run until interrupt relies on it [hap, Saurus].
- 0.154              : Added missing members to save registration and fixed typo in M6809 device_post_load(), fixing savestate regressions in many drivers that use this CPU family [Alex Jackson].

Fixed compile on older OS X tools (m6809\m6809.h) [Curt Coder]. Changed CPU_DISASSEMBLE to use cpu_device * instead of legacy_cpu_device *, so that class based cpu devices can also be passed (m6809\m6809.c and 6809dasm.c) [smf]. Get rid of the M6809 preprocessor pass, for great justice (cpu\cpu.mak and m6809\m6809make.py) [O. Galibert]. Looked through m6809 ops and fixed what i noticed (improves Rollergames) (m6809\base6x09.ops and konami.ops) [hap].

- 0.128u4            : Pointer-ified the 6809 CPU core [Couriersud]: Temporarily named the state var m68_state in the 68xx cores. Reorganized some code for simpler comparison of 68xx cores. Nicola Salmoria added M6809 config option to control where opcodes 10 and 11 fetch the second byte. Changed 6809 disassembler to work with Kram (encrypted). Switched M6809 to new memory functions [Couriersud]: Cleaned up some macros. Aligned code a bit more. Interrupts now checked in cpu_execute instead of set_context.

- 15th June      2000: A small bug in the M6809 core was squished, fixing some CoCo 3 program bug on the MESS side.
- 0.36b8             : Cleaned up the 6809 emulations [Juergen Buchmueller].
- 25th October   1999: Juergen Buchmueller fixed some m6809 bugs and made new ones.

- 0.30               : Added m6809\6809dasm.c. Removed m6809\m6809.txt.
- 0.29               : Some optimizations to the 6809 emulator [Tatsuyuki Satoh, Aaron Giles]. Modified it to always fetch opcodes directly from RAM (much faster). The Ghosts 'n Goblins, Star Wars and Williams drivers needed reworking to support that [Aaron Giles]. New memory handling functions, about 10%-30% faster than before. Moved the memory code from cpuintrf.c to memory.c. Banked ROMs can now be handled in a cleaner and faster way. Use the new MRA_BANK1... types in the memory handler arrays, and cpu_setbank() to set the current bank. The Z80 and M6809 emulators natively support bank switching. IMPORTANT: for 24 bit addressing (i.e. 68000) you cannot associate a memory handler to a single byte. You must use four consecutive bytes, longword aligned. This was done to speedup word (2 bytes) and dword (4 bytes) operations [Tatsuyuki Satoh, Aaron Giles].
- 0.28               : Added m6809\6809ops.c. John Butler provided a new 6809 emulator. It is faster than the previous one, and fixes some bugs including the ship moving in the wrong direction on the tower level of Star Wars and the bonus maze in Pac & Pal.

- 0.21               : Added m6809\m6809.c/h and copying.txt. Added M6809 CPU support. Changes in CPUIntrf.c and Driver.h to accommodate the new CPU. The first driver working on this CPU is Super Pac Man. The driver is based on the super-detailed SUPERPAC.KEG file of Replay emulator by Kevin Brisley. M6809 emulator is based on L.C. Benschop's 6809 Simulator V09 (Copyright 1994,1995 L.C. Benschop, Eidnhoven The Netherlands).

3.8   M68000

- 0.185              : Workaround for multiple inclusion until SoftFloat is updated to version 3 (cpu\m68000\m68000.h) [AJR].
- 0.180              : Changed the m68k disassembler to use 'std::ostream &' internally [Nathan Woods]. Changed (MESS) drivers apollo.cpp and fccpu30.cpp from accessing has_fpu directly to use new set and get methods. FPU enable/disable methods (cpu\m68000\m68000.h).
- 0.179              : Fixed disassembly window updating when you set pc/curpc on 68000 [smf]. Added [[noreturn]] instead of ATTR_NORETURN (cpu\m68000\m68kmake.cpp) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.176              : Replaced M68000 write_irq[1-7] handlers with DEVCB_INPUTLINE [AJR].

- 0.171              : Removed cpu\m68000\m68kmake.exe/o and m68kops.cpp/h. Removed generated files for m68k cpu core. Updated makefile to generate m68k files. Fix to work on OSX and Linux as well. makefile should inherit CC and GCC if set in parent makefile. Added user overriden parameters for compiling mc68k core (makefile) [Miodrag Milanovic].

- 0.165              : Added M68kFPU mode 7, reg 0 (cpu\m68000\m68kfpu.inc) in advance of the (MESS) ROLM 9751 driver in development [Brandon Munger].
- 0.164              : Fixed unaligned pc-relative accesses (m68000\m68kcpu.h) [O. Galibert].
- 0.161              : Added cpu\m68000\m68kops.c/h and cpu\m68000\makefile. Added generated m68kops files to tree, added makefile for developers working on core [Miodrag Milanovic]. Commented out fprintf(stderr, "Reloaded, pc=%x\n", REG_PC(m68k)) [Couriersud].
- 0.158              : Implement FTRAP instruction [R. Belmont].
- 0.157              : Disassembler support for FTRAP (cpu\m68000\m68kdasm.c). Generate the correct kind of stack frame for 68010 bus errors (m68000\m68kcpu.c) [R. Belmont].
- 0.155              : Changed overlapping memcpy() to memmove() (m68000\m68kmake.c) [Casper Ti. Vector]. Added missing save state registration (m68000\m68kcpu.c) [Alex Jackson].
- 0.154              : Added some missing save state entries (m68000\m68kcpu.c). Added one fpu case (m68000\m68kfpu.inc). Enable rounding mode (m68000\m68kfpu.inc) [O. Galibert]. Update used and modified bits in the page tables and greatly improved PTEST results on 68040 (m68000\m68000.h, m68kcpu.c and m68kmmu.h) [R. Belmont]. M68000 callbacks to delegates. Implement TAS callback (currently only used by Megadrive) in a more sensible and versatile way [Miodrag Milanovic]. Smear byte writes the same as a real 68000. Fixed the debugger so watchpoints continue to work as expected [Alex Jackson]. Fixed regression caused by 68k change (drivers\cbuster.c, gstriker.c, magicard.c, mpu4vid.c, niyanpai.c, nmk16.c, segas16b.c, toaplan2.c (only Ghox), machine\bonzeadv.c, rainbow.c, video\aquarium.c, tumbleb.c) [David Haywood, Alex Jackson, James Wallace].
- 0.153              : Changed cpu\m68000\m68kfpu.c to m68kfpu.inc [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.152              : Enhancements (cpu\m68000\m68k_in.c) [O. Galibert]. Added ability for externally-thrown bus errors to have proper details [R. Belmont].
- 0.151              : Added FSCALE instruction used by e.g. SimCity 2000 (cpu\m68000\m68kfpu.c) [R. Belmont]. Fixed m68k->remaining_cycles, see http://mikro.naprvyraz.sk/docs/Coding/Atari/Maggie/FPU.TXT and http://www.atari-forum.com/viewtopic.php?f=68&t=1646 for table used. Atari guys seem to have them all timed out [Cowering].
- 0.150              : A regular 68000 processor will generate a read operation when using the clr.b/.w/.l opcodes, this was fixed and changed on the 020. I'm not aware of any software explicitly requiring this right now, but it would be detectable if you have read-triggered hardware and various 68k documents advise caution when using the opcodes and porting code using said opcodes to a 020 based machine for that reason. There was some private discussion with Charles before doing this, apparently it is detectable on the Genesis where a read from the VDP port will increment the internal address counter [David Haywood].
- 0.149u1            : Changed name '68000' to 'M68000'. Setjmp / longjmp doesn't play nice in 64-bit debug compiles in a modern core, so use C++ exceptions to mimic the behavior. Probably could be improved [David Haywood]. Fixed handling of double fault, not sure if this is proper or some other trap should be generated (cpu\m68000\m68kcpu.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.146u4            : Handle higher-value constants in FMOVECR (cpu\m68000\m68kfpu.c) [R. Belmont].
- 0.145u8            : Various Clang warning cleanups in m68000\m68kcpu.h [Balrog].
- 0.145u7            : M68k improvements [Hans Ostermeyer]: Fixed BFINS, BFEXTU and BFEXTS to fetch 8-bit quantities as 8 bits (corrects Domain/OS 10.3.5 crash on page boundry). Added SoftFloat log functions and m68k FLOGNP1, FLOGN, FLOG2 and FLOG10 instructions.
- 0.145u5            : Fixed SoftFloat sin/cos/tan to return correct results. Sorted out the m68k bit patterns for PFLUSHA and PFLUSHAN [Hans Ostermeyer].
- 0.145u2            : Added API to install a non-debugger instruction hook to m68k. Usage is strongly NOT recommended except for dire cases [R. Belmont]. Not checking fc in 680x0 TTx translation? That's a patchin'. Ensure fc/rw and fault address are consistant in 680x0 [O. Galibert].
- 0.145u1            : Fixed register in m68000\m68kcpu.h [O. Galibert]. Fixed FSGLMUL/FSGLDIV plus some minor MMU improvements [Hans Ostermeyer].
- 0.144u5            : Fix for M680x0 case where the MMU trashed memory [R. Belmont].
- 0.143u7            : Fix for MINGW compiler optimization for M68000. Fixed many sets using m68000-family CPU: Access Violation [Sandro Ronco]. Activate m68k trace emulation and fixed it [O. Galibert]. Avoid a m68000 case when dropping the irq mask just after taking a auto-acked interrupt would cause a spurious irq [O. Galibert]. Reset the m68000 double-bus/address-error flag where appropriate to avoid halting on consecutive but not linked exceptions [O. Galibert].
- 0.143u6            : Belegdol and R. Belmont fixed another m68k buffer overflow bug.
- 0.143u4            : Improved m68k disassembly of CINV and CPUSH [R. Belmont].
- 0.143u3            : Stanislav Shwartsman and R. Belmont added m68k FSIN, FCOS and FTAN using SoftFloat extensions. O. Galibert fixed m68k instruction support table ("fixes" taitojc regression).
- 0.143u2            : Set m68k read/write bit properly in special status on MMU bus errors. Added bus error input line, fixed FMOVEM, fixed issues with HMMU [R. Belmont]. Generate a m68k per-cpu-type jump table. Correct linef handling makes the Atari ST less cranky [O. Galibert].
- 0.141u4            : Curt Coder exposed the M68000 supervisor flag for external MMUs to determine the current address space. Exposed the complete function code of the M68000 (instead of just FC2 as previously).
- 0.141u3            : M680x0 updates [Hans Ostermeyer]: Instruction cache emulated on '020 and later. Fixed interaction between MMU and bfextu/bfexts/bfins. Added fsgldiv, fsglmul and fscc FPU instructions. Fixed fault address in stack frame. Fixed supervisor violation bit in MMU status register. Added fmovem modes 1 and 3. Various other MMU fixes.
- 0.140u2            : Many M680x0 FPU and PMMU fixes and enhancements [Hans Ostermeyer].
- 0.139u4            : R. Belmont added more M68k conditionals and FGETEXP instruction.
- 0.139u2            : Updated 68k core to use unaligned read/ write instead of their own stubs for handling misalinged reads [Aaron Giles].
- 0.137u2            : M680x0 FPU updates [R. Belmont]: BCD packed decimal now supported, including k-factor. Improved FSAVE/FRESTORE including FPU reset when restoring a NULL frame. FREM instruction supported. Better disassembly of FPU instructions.
- 0.137u1            : 680x0 FPU updates [R. Belmont]: Rewritten to use SoftFloat instead of unportable native FP math. Support added for Motorola 96-bit extended floats. More addressing modes and conditions supported. Implemented FMOVECR. Added load extended PC relative indexed support. Cleanup some duplicated code.
- 0.137              : R. Belmont improved disassembly for various 680x0 FMOVE forms.
- 0.135u1            : MC680x0 update [R. Belmont]: Reworked PMMU/core interface so PMMU now sees all cop 0 instructions. Improved disassembly of PMMU instructions.
- 0.135              : 680x0 update [R. Belmont]: Support PMOVE modes from PMMU. Allow the FPU to be used for both '030 and '040. Added byte and word FPU loads/stores. Fixed buggy FPU 64-bit stores in the (An) addressing mode.
- 0.134u3            : Added cpu\m68000\m68kmmu.h. m68k updates [R. Belmont]: Throw F-line trap correctly when PMMU instructions are hit on non-equipped CPUs. Added working PMMU address translation (not feature complete, but sufficient to boot several 68030 Macs in MESS). Fixed up disassembly of some PMMU instructions. Added "68020 with 68851" CPU type.
- 0.134u2            : R. Belmont added disassemble PMOVE instruction (move to/from PMMU) to m68k. Harmony fleshed out SCC68070 definition in m68k core, for CD-i use in MESS.
- 0.134u1            : m68k (cpu\m68000\m68kcpu.h): don't save signal contexts on *BSD and Mac OS X [scarlet, R. Belmont].
- 0.133u1            : hap fixed a bug related to eating cycles during 68k cpu reset (cpu\m68000\m68kcpu.c). Previously, initial_cycles had a wrong value after reset, and if cycles were < 0, it'd always return 0. This change also happens to fix a scrolling bug in Fantasy Zone, introduced when that cycle eating thing was added.
- 0.131u3            : CPUs actually take some time to reset. Changed the 68000/68010 to eat an appropriate number of cycles after a reset [Aaron Giles].
- 0.129              : Removed cpu\m68000\m68kconf.h. Aaron Giles converted 68000 core to use state tables. Cleaned up cycle handling in the 68k core.
- 0.128u4            : Removed cpu\m68000\m68k.h and m68kmame.c/h. Significantly pared down the 68k core [Aaron Giles]: Merged outer MAME shell into the core proper and removed unused macros. Changed all external interfaces to pass the CPU device. Enabled 64-bit operations by default. Re-derived the interface functions to cascade and share code more aggressively. These changes also seem to have cured the taito_f3 issues as far as I can tell (at least pbobble3 seems right now). Disentangled the 68000 core [Aaron Giles]: Converting it to be much simpler and less overly abstracted. Hard-coded it for the options that are relevant and never going to change. Removed old unused CPS2 encryption junk. Changed encryption interfaces to pass the CPU core object. Switched M68000 to new memory functions [Couriersud].
- 0.128u3            : Aaron Giles began the process of pruning options from the 68000 core, hard-coding it for MAME's needs. We've hacked on it sufficiently that it is no longer generic, so this is a good opportunity to simplify the code so that it can actually be followed (still in progress). Aaron Giles converted the M680x0 cores to reference their data via pointers instead of global structs, in anticipation of future changes.
- 0.127u7            : Aaron Giles fixed a number of regressions due to recent 68000 IRQ changes.
- 0.127u6            : Aaron Giles changed 68000 interrupts to only trigger during execution. This means that multiple changes without any execution will be seen as atomic. It also means that PULSE_LINE no longer works for signalling IRQs.
- 0.127u1            : Olivier Galibert changed 68000 IRQ support so that the IRQ lines explicitly simulate a standard demux chip connected to the IRQ lines. This means that the sequence: cpunum_set_input_line(5, ASSERT_LINE); cpunum_set_input_line(3, ASSERT_LINE); and cpunum_set_input_line(3, CLEAR_LINE) now works as expected. This required fixes to several Atari and other drivers. Small optimization to memory handling for 68000 core [Christophe Jaillet].
- 0.123u5            : Aaron Giles fixed 68000 prefetching operation. Previous behavior was incorrect. Fabio Priuli fixed M68000 build logic to only include it if enabled.
- 0.117              : Zsolt Vasvari fixed ROL opcode in the 68000 emulator.
- 0.111u1            : Removed cpu\m68000\cpudefs.h. Alex Jackson fixed two bugs in the m68000 core: Fixed a miscompilation issue with GCC4 that was first noticed in Altered Beast but also affected Moonwalker, Galaxy Force 2, and probably many other games. Fixed the core's compile-time self-configuration so that it uses the same code paths on LP64 platforms (64-bit Linux, etc.) as on LLP64 (64-bit Windows) and 32-bit platforms. Giuseppe Gorgoglione removed m68000\cpudefs.h. This was used by the old assembly m68000 core. Removed from m68kmame.c and m68kmame.h as well many references to the old core (e.g A68K0, A68K2, etc.).
- 0.109u1            : Aaron Giles simplified the 68000 core generation logic to just produce one file. Hopefully this will cure some of the build issues with the core.
- 0.108u1            : David Haywood added a callback to the 68000 emulator for the TAS instruction, which allows different implementations based on external hardware.
- 0.107u1            : Charles MacDonald fixed memory write ordering bug in the 68000 core.
- 0.105u1            : Added cpu\m68000\m68kfpu.c.
- 0.104u4            : Aaron Giles updated the 68000 disassembler to use the new interfaces. More global system cleanup [Aaron Giles, Atari Ace]: Moved 68000-specific build rules to cpu.mak.
- 0.102u2            : Alex Jackson tweaked the 68000 disassembler to display F-line traps in a more obvious fashion. Also changed to decorate jump targets for relative branches.
- 0.98u1             : Aaron Giles turned on address error checking in the 68000 core. This slows things down a bit but is more accurate and allows correct behavior of a couple of badly-programmed games. Fixed several issues with address error checking in the 68000 core. Fixed 68000 bug that treated 8-bit branches with $FF offsets as illegal, rather than allowing them and generating an address error.
- 30th June      2005: Jorge Cwik - I solved the undocumented timing of the 68000 DIVU/DIVS instructions: Below is attached source code for computing the exact number of cycles taken by a specific division on the Motorola 68000 CPU. As far as I know this information was not (publicly) available before. Current emulators for 68000-based machines (Amiga, Atari ST, MAC, MAME, etc) reached an amazing level of accuracy. The exact timing of the division instructions remained as one of the main inaccuracies because this is not documented in the available manuals. Hopefully, with this issue solved now, 68000 emulation can take one-step forward. The code and algorithm was only partially tested. It is not feasible to do an exhaustive test on real hardware in a single machine. The source code is available at: http://pasti.fxatari.com/docs/div68kCycleAccurate.c.
- 0.95u3             : Andrew Seed fixed cycle counts for several 68000 instructions.
- 0.92               : Removed cpu\m68000\asmintf.c and cpu\m68000\make68k.c.
- 0.87u3             : Olivier Galibert added some hooks to C 68k core in preparation for Sega decryption updates.
- 0.81               : Sebastien Volpe improved timing of several 68k instructions, these changes could do with being verified on a real 68k. m68kcpu.h, m68kcpu.c: A) scc (68000 only): CYC_SCC_R_FALSE was defined, not used, and misnamed as the extra 2 cycles happens when CC is true: now used and renamed to CYC_SCC_R_TRUE. m68kmake.c: B) add/adda/and/or/sub/suba (68000 only): the 'extra 2 cycles' cases were not handled correctly: corrected to be effective on .l only, and also on register direct (previously, all sizes were affected, and only in immediate mode). C) jmp d(An,Xn) / pea (An) (68000/68010): tables corrected. D) movem (68000/68010): generated basecount were incorrect in many cases, so I added a dedicated table. m68k_in.c: E) movem.l d(PC),reglist / movem.l d(PC,Xn),reglist (68000/68010): changed basecount. F) asr/asl/lsr/lsl/ror/rol/roxr/roxl (68000/68010): added '+2n' cycles where missing, as the shift/rotate memory is the only case where '+2n' does not apply, and is treated in a specific opcode handler.
- 0.79u2             : Leon van Rooij fixed a m68kdasm bug.
- 0.79               : Fixed ASM 68k core to compile again [BUT].
- 0.78u3             : Aaron Giles fixed the inability to compile with asm 68k.
- 0.72u2             : Acho A. Tang fixed a bug in the C 68000 core with the SBCD Opcode. States of the sign(N) and overflow(V) flags after SBCD, ABCD and NBCD operations are "undefined" according to Motorola. The C core randomizes the V flag and sets the N flag like signed operations. Viofight expects determinant results of the two flags from SBCD or it gets stuck in a math loop. The V flag now returns zero and the N flag mirrors carry exactly like what the ASM core does.
- 15th August    2003: Acho A. Tang fixed Viewpoint from crashing with the ASM 68k core too.
- 0.69u3             : Razoola changed MULU timing in ASM 68k core so that it matches the C ones.
- 0.69a              : C 68k core is now default, this fixes collisions in Assault.
- 26th May       2003: David Haywood forwarded the 68k CPU core select and Neo Geo save states from MAME32 Plus!
- 25th October   2002: Mike Coates fixed the LSL / LSR opcodes in the ASM 68k core.
- 11th June      2002: Karl Stenerud updated the C 68k core to emulate address error exceptions.
-  9th May       2002: Olivier Galibert fixed the reset opcode in the ASM 68k core.

- 21st February  1999: Karl Stenerud has sent in a newer C m68k core.
- 0.35b2             : Added m68000\m68000.c, m68kconf.h, m68kmame.c/h, d68kconf.h and d68000.c/h. Removed m68000\m68kdasm.c, mc68kmem.c, cpufunc.c, cputbl.h, opcode0.c-e.c, dis68k.c and asm.bat. New 68000 C core [Karl Stenerud]. For testing purposes, this is also being used in the DOS version instead of the asm core. Differences: 1. Faster. This code is, barring ram fetch time, almost twice as fast as the existing C core in MAME. I've done extensive speed profiling on both engines. The only problem now is the slow memory access in MAME due to bankswitching et al. 2. Emulation more correct. I found many bugs in the MAME engine (and many, many more in mine for that matter) when I pitted them head-to-head. I have run random instructions from each opcode class at least 10 million times, comparing the resultant CPU states, and have left it running random instructions for 1 billion iterations. In every case, I have adhered to the specs defined in M68000PM/AD REV.1. 3. Disassembler is correct. The current M68000 disassembler in MAME has a tendency to disassemble instructions that have an invalid EA mode. 4. Cycle counting is 99.9% correct. The only instructions which don't have  correct cycle counts are divs, divu, muls, mulu and they're not worth counting correctly. (I'm not about to waste emulation time counting 0-1 and 1-0 sequences). 5. > 32 bit friendly. I've taken care to ensure maximum portability without sacrificing speed. The result is conditional compiling dependant on your architecture. I've also implemented and tested a compatible solution for  architectures that lack 8, 16, or 32 bit signed storage types. 6. The code is carefully laid out to be readable. (I beg to differ - NS).
- 0.35b1             : Added m68000\asm.bat. The 68000 based games no longer have to read and mix two 8 bit ports to get a 16 bit value [Brad Oliver].
- 0.34               : Bryan McPhail made several improvements and bug fixes to the Data East 68000 games (Midnight Resistance, Bad Dudes, Robocop, etc.).
- 0.34b6             : The x86 asm 68000 core: several bugs have been fixed (most notably, it now runs under pure DOS) but it is still not complete. For example, the two Metal Slugs hang shortly after game start. They will work if you recompile using the C core.
- 0.34b6             : Several games have experimental 68000 idle cycle skipping, for these games you should see increases of between 5% and 20%. Games currently using this method are: Puzzle De Pon, Karnov's Revenge, Wind Jammers, Street Hoops and Neo Bomberman. Note about the x86 asm 68000 core: several bugs have been fixed (most notably, it now runs under pure DOS) but it is still not complete. For example, the two Metal Slugs hang shortly after game start. They will work if you recompile using the C core.
- 0.34b5             : Added m68000\asmintf.c and make68k.c. x86 ASM 68000 core [Mike Coates, Darren Olafson]. This is a major speed improvement.
- 0.34b4             : Brad Oliver fixed bug in the 68000 interrupt handling which causes Rastan Saga to not boot correctly.

- 0.33b7             : Added m68000\cycletbl.h. Close to accurate 68000 instruction timing [Brian Verre]. Darren Olafson slightly improved speed of the 68000 emulator.
- 0.33b4             : The 68000 memory handlers can again be word-aligned instead of longword-aligned [Aaron Giles].
- 0.33b1             : Juergen Buchmueller improved speed of the C 68000 core (this is supposed to give a good speed increase, but I don't see any appreciable difference on my K6 - Nicola).
- 0.31               : Aaron Giles fixed 68000 emulator to properly handle interrupt priorities. Memory for the 68000 is allocated automatically. You no longer have to do it yourself. The memory interface reads/writes 16 bits at a time to improve performance. Writing a single byte is a bit tricky, because the 68000 can cause write to either the high or the low byte without affecting the other; thus the second parameter for a 16-bit write is a bit more complicated. The top 16 bits are a mask which is supposed to be ANDed with the 16-bit value already in memory; the bottom 16 bits are the actual data values, to be ORed with the result. To aid in doing these operations, use the macros READ_WORD(), WRITE_WORD(), COMBINE_WORD() and COMBINE_WORD_MEM() [Aaron Giles].
- 0.30               : Added m68000\m68kdasm.c and dis68k.c. Removed m68000\m68000.txt. Some changes to the 68000 emulator memory interface, and a new 68000 disassembler. Improved the 68000 CPU interface [Aaron Giles].
- 0.28               : Added m68000\cpudefs.h, cpufunc.c, cputbl.h, m68000.h, mc68kmem.c, opcode0.c - opcodee.c and readcpu.h. Jarek Burczynski adapted the M68000 emulator from the System 16 Arcade Emulator by Thierry Lescot. The only known problem of this emulator is that it doesn't count CPU cycles, only instructions. The first driver to use the 68000 is Rastan, also provided by Jarek.

3.82  M68010

- 0.151              : The 68010 does not perform a read before write during a CLR instruction (m68000\m68k_in.c). This fixed wrong colors on title screen and during gameplay in all sets in Hard Drivin' driver. NOTE: "clr insns on 68000 read before writing. This isn't so on the 68010, but we have no TARGET_68010." (http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/gcc/gcc-1765/gcc/config/m68k/m68k.c). "The special thing about a CLR (on the 68000, fixed in the 68010 and onwards I believe) is, that the processor does a source read before doing a destination write." (http://www.zophar.net/fileuploads/2/10544qufns/jag68k.txt) [Phil Bennett].
- 0.149u1            : Changed name '68010' to 'M68010'.

- 0.131u3            : CPUs actually take some time to reset. Changed the 68000/68010 to eat an appropriate number of cycles after a reset [Aaron Giles].
- 0.112u2            : Ernesto Corvi fixed behavior of MOVEC instruction on later 680x0 chips and in the disassembler.
- 28th January   2001: Karl Stenerud sent in an update to the C 68k core, containing the beginnings of 68000/010 and 68020 separation.
- 27th January   2001: Mike Coates separated the 68000/010 and 68020 cores so that the ASM 68k core can be used with the C 68020 core, giving a nice speed boost to all the 68k games.
- 0.36RC1            : Changed name 'MC68010' to '68010'.

3.83  M68020 / M68EC020

- 0.181              : Respect 68020 "freeze I-cache" bit; (MESS) 'Micro 20' 68020 cache test now passes [R. Belmont].
- 0.170              : Fixed (020+) bfins results and Z flag (m68000\m68k_in.cpp) [Till Harbaum].
- 0.166              : Fixed corner case for 020+ bitfield instructions (m68000\m68k_in.c and m68kops.c). Fixed 020+ PACK/UNPK nibble ordering [Till Harbaum, R. Belmont].
- 0.164              : Fixed '020 cache emulation corner case [Hans Ostermeyer].
- 0.159              : Emulated instruction cache for 68020/68EC020 (MC68020 User's Manual, Section 4 - On-Chip Cache Memory). Drivers tested gained anywhere from 3-10% unthrottled on Taito F3 and Konami GX games, 10-12% on the Mac II and 140% on Semicom's Dream World [R. Belmont].
- 0.158              : Implement FTRAP instruction and added "68020 with FPU" CPU type [R. Belmont].
- 0.150              : A regular 68000 processor will generate a read operation when using the clr.b/.w/.l opcodes, this was fixed and changed on the 020. I'm not aware of any software explicitly requiring this right now, but it would be detectable if you have read-triggered hardware and various 68k documents advise caution when using the opcodes and porting code using said opcodes to a 020 based machine for that reason. There was some private discussion with Charles before doing this, apparently it is detectable on the Genesis where a read from the VDP port will increment the internal address counter (cpu\m68000\m68k_in.c) [David Haywood].
- 0.149u1            : Changed names '68020' to 'M68020' and '68EC020' to 'M68EC020'.
- 0.145u5            : Allow FPU instructions on '020 (it's possible to have an external 68881/882) and fix missing break; in the FPU [Hans Ostermeyer].
- 0.144u5            : Fix for M680x0 case where the MMU trashed memory [R. Belmont].
- 0.141u3            : M680x0 updates [Hans Ostermeyer]: Instruction cache emulated on '020 and later. Fixed interaction between MMU and bfextu/bfexts/bfins.

- 0.128u4            : Aaron Giles fixed the 68EC020 CPU, which has graphics regression / game resets in most sets using the 68EC020 CPU.
- 0.128u3            : Aaron Giles updated cpuexec to compute the "perfect" interleave value taking into account the minimum number of cycles per instruction specified by the CPU core. Fixed incorrect minimum cpi in the 68020+ cores.
- 0.112u2            : Ernesto Corvi fixed behavior of MOVEC instruction on later 680x0 chips, and in the disassembler.
- 0.110u1            : Aaron Giles fixed max instruction bytes for 68020+ CPUs to avoid assertion in new disassembler.
- 0.80u1             : Fixed the opcode view which in some cases displayed too many bytes on 32 bit CPUs such as 68020 and Hyperstone [Bryan McPhail].
- 25th November  2001: Bryan McPhail resent an old bug fix to the 68020 CPU core which fixes a crash in Under Fire.
- 16th June      2001: Aaron Giles updated the ASM 68020 core, making the itech32 games playable with it but others not yet.

- 27th January   2001: Mike Coates separated the 68000/010 and 68020 cores so that the ASM 68k core can be used with the C 68020 core, giving a nice speed boost to all the 68k games.
- 15th January   2001: Bryan McPhail finally submitted his Taito F3 driver, which is not graphically perfect and crashes hard sometimes but has complete ES5505 sound emulation thanks to Aaron Giles, Ian Schmidt and R. Belmont. Not all games are working due to 68020 core bugs.
- 0.37b9             : The 68EC020 core now uses 32-bit memory handlers. The Psikyo driver has been updated to use the new interface. Unfortunately, this support has yet to make it into the x86 asm 68000 core, so it is once again disabled for this build [Aaron Giles].
- 17th October   2000: Aaron Giles updated the C 68k core to support 32-bit bus width in 68020 emulation.
- 0.37b8             : The x86 asm 68000 core now has limited 68020 support and runs the Psikyo games, so is reenabled by default [Darren Olafson].

3.84  M68030 / M68EC030

- 0.159              : Emulated instruction cache for 68020/68EC020. Drivers tested gained anywhere from 3-10% unthrottled on Taito F3 and Konami GX games, 10-12% on the Mac II and 140% on Semicom's Dream World [R. Belmont].
- 0.149u1            : Changed name '68EC030' to 'M68EC030'.
- 22nd March     2012: R. Belmont - I worked with Hans Ostermeyer to integrate his branched Apollo workstation driver into mainline MESS; it's now in there and you can successfully install and run Domain/OS in the emulation. He fixed several issues in our 68030/68040 emulation along the way, which is good for everything.
- 0.144u5            : Fix for M680x0 case where the MMU trashed memory [R. Belmont].
- 0.143u3            : M68040 FPU opcodes are somewhat available on a 030 when the FPU is added [O. Galibert].
- 0.141u3            : M680x0 updates [Hans Ostermeyer]: Instruction cache emulated on '020 and later. Fixed interaction between MMU and bfextu/bfexts/bfins. Added fsgldiv, fsglmul and fscc FPU instructions. Fixed fault address in stack frame. Fixed supervisor violation bit in MMU status register. Added fmovem modes 1 and 3. Various other MMU fixes.
- 0.140u2            : Many M680x0 FPU and PMMU fixes and enhancements [Hans Ostermeyer].
- 0.139u4            : 68030 MMU now emulates translation cache; fixed misinterpreted MMU opcodes [R. Belmont].
- 0.137u2            : M680x0 FPU updates [R. Belmont]: BCD packed decimal now supported, including k-factor. Improved FSAVE/FRESTORE including FPU reset when restoring a NULL frame. FREM instruction supported. Better disassembly of FPU instructions.
- 0.137u1            : 680x0 FPU updates [R. Belmont]: Rewritten to use SoftFloat instead of unportable native FP math. Support added for Motorola 96-bit extended floats. More addressing modes and conditions supported. Implemented FMOVECR. Added load extended PC relative indexed support. Cleanup some duplicated code.
- 0.137              : Show FPU registers in the debugger for 68030+. Improved disassembly for various FMOVE forms [R. Belmont].
- 0.136u4            : John R. Hauser added MAME-ified version of SoftFloat library (lib\softfloat\softfloat.c). NOTE (R. Belmont): There's no portable way to use the host's FPU for high-precision floating point. GCC has extensions which map to Intel's 80-bit extended floats, but support on non-x86/x64 is sketchy and MSVC doesn't support floats > 32 bits at all. I plan to use SoftFloat for the 68030/040 FPU up front, but it will also be useful in the future for emulating the 386/486/Pentium/etc FPUs (Bochs uses it for exactly that purpose).
- 0.135u1            : MC680x0 update [R. Belmont]: Reworked PMMU/core interface so PMMU now sees all cop 0 instructions. Improved disassembly of PMMU instructions. Fixed disassembly for EC/LC variants of '030/'040.
- 0.135              : 680x0 update [R. Belmont]: Support PMOVE modes from PMMU. Allow the FPU to be used for both '030 and '040. Added byte and word FPU loads/stores. Fixed buggy FPU 64-bit stores in the (An) addressing mode.

- 0.106u9            : Improved M68040 FPU emulation [Ville Linde].
- 22nd June      2006: Ville Linde - I have made some major improvements to the Taito JC System driver. First I improved and fixed bugs in the M68040 FPU. Then I found the missing vertical blank interrupt, after which things really started to work. After that, I needed to figure out how the 2D graphics works. Turns out the 2D graphics chip is just a basic object processor, not too different from the one in Konami's Firebeat hardware. Landing Gear and Side by Side 2 already run through their attract modes. Densya De Go! also shows some graphics, but hangs pretty soon. Apparently it needs a bit more of the train controller emulated.
- 0.105u1            : Ville Linde added many FPU opcodes to the M68040 core.
- 10th April     2006: Ville Linde - I picked up the Taito JC System driver again in hopes of getting it to do something interesting. The two major roadblocks were the missing FPU stuff from the M68040 core and the missing TMS320C51 DSP core. The TMS DSP emulation already works well enough that the basic communication and ROM tests are already working. There's also enough of the 68040 FPU emulated that the games won't just crash when they hit FPU opcodes. None of the games still show anything interesting graphics-wise, but progress is progress nevertheless.
- 0.97u5             : Ville Linde added very basic 68040 support to the 68000 core.
-  8th April 2004: David Haywood - I don't think I'll be finishing this one myself somehow, needs a 68040 core (currently running on the 68020) and various other bits and pieces before it stands a chance of working. WIP driver should be included in the next update tho.

3.86  M68301/MC68307

- 0.154              : Removed machine\68307ser.c/h. Updated 68307's 68681 to an actual sub-device instead of pairing it in the game driver [David Haywood]. Using delegates for 68307 [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.152              : Updated BFM Fruit drivers to use the N68681 device (machine\68307.c/h and 68307ser.c/h) [Osso].
- 0.149u1            : Changed names '68301' to 'M68301' and '68307' to 'MC68307'. Added machine\68307.c/h. Moved cpu\m68000\68307bus.c/h, 68307ser.c/h, 68307sim.c/h and 68307tmu.c/h to emu\machine\. Now that we're modern treat the 68307 like other modern CPUs by using a derived type with the peripherals in emu\machine instead of being glued into the CPU core [David Haywood].
- 0.145u7            : Improved the serial emulation in 68307 and added some logging, removing the hack in bfm_sc4.c. More work on 68307's [David Haywood].
- 0.145u6            : Added m68000\68307bus.c/h, 68307ser.c/h, 68307sim.c/h and 68307tmu.c/h. Added preliminary on-board peripherals to 68307 and 68340 [David Haywood].

- 0.188              : Added configuration macros and callbacks for 8 bit ports A and B (machine\68340.cpp). Added 8 bit ports A and B, updated LOG system (machine\68340sim.cpp) [Joakim Larsson Edstrom].
- 0.178              : Memberize public non-member function of m68340cpu_device [AJR].
- 0.154              : Should be READ32_MEMBER( m68340_internal_serial_r ), not READ32_HANDLER (machine\68340.h and 68340ser.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.150              : Make it a bit more obvious cupidon.c is a video based system, not a screenless fruit machine one [David Haywood].
- 0.149u1            : Changed name 'Freescale 68340' to 'MC68340'. Moved cpu\m68000\68340dma.c/h, 68340ser.c/h, 68340sim.c/h and 68340tmu.c/h to emu\machine\. Added machine\68340.c/h. Untangle the skeleton 68340, where the code ends up is TBD. The actual core type of the 68340 is CPU32, so it is now derived from that [David Haywood].
- 0.145u8            : Misc 68340 related progress [David Haywood].
- 0.145u6            : Added 68340dma.c/h, 68340ser.c/h, 68340sim.c/h and 68340tmu.c/h. Added preliminary on-board peripherals to 68307 and 68340 [David Haywood].
- 0.143u5            : Preliminary support for MC68340 (CPU32). Reorganized to facilitate C++ conversion [David Haywood]. Use 68340 instruction table for 68340, cpXXX instructions are 020/030 only, add CINV, CPUSH stubs for 040 [R. Belmont].
- NOTES: The MC68340 is a high-performance 32-bit integrated processor with direct memory access (DMA), combining an enhanced M68000-compatible processor, 32-bit DMA, and other peripheral subsystems on a single integrated circuit. The MC68340 CPU32 delivers 32-bit CISC processor performance from a lower cost 16-bit memory system. The combination of peripherals offered in the MC68340 can be found in a diverse range of microprocessor-based systems. Systems requiring very high-speed block transfers of data can benefit from the MC68340.

- 0.134u4            : Andrew Gardner fixed DSP56156 DO & BSCC opcode bugs.
-  6th October   2009: Andrew Gardner - Polygonz attack! The other day i figured out one of the things I was doing wrong with the dsp56156 CPU core. Adding a little logic allowed Polygonet Commanders to go "in-game." Arbee and Haze hooked up the ROZ layer, giving us a dandy little sky. Of course there isn't any 3d since that isn't emulated yet, but that's the part of MAME that i like doing. To that end, I captured a bunch of the data that the 68020 was sending across to the DSP56k. Here is the first round of polygonal uploads from the main CPU to the sub CPU.
- 0.134u2            : Hacked in the DSP56156's "Long Interrupts". Added SUB opcode. Polygonet Commanders now goes in-game! [Andrew Gardner].
- 0.134u1            : Andrew Gardner fixed various issues with the DSP56156 disassembler.

- 0.128u3            : Continued rewrite of the Motorola DSP56k CPU core [Andrew Gardner, PhilB, RBelmont]: Added proper clock speed to plygonet.c and internal divider to dsp56k.c. Fixed up disassembler add/sub, 05xx and bsr ops. Handle mysterious uuuuF instruction found in plygonet add op.

Partially implemented tfr op. Polygonet now allows test mode to be run for a few seconds. Most IO is now known, though coin2 is still a mystery. Partially implemented move, asr4 and mpy ops.
- 0.128u1            : Rewrite of the Motorola DSP56k CPU core [Andrew Gardner]: Complete rewrite focusing on legibility and extensibility. 27/121 opcodes (mostly) implemented. Bugfix for reset status of interrupt priority bits. Bugfix for disassembly of register-to-register parallel data move. Added additional branch, move and bitfield ops. Polygonet Commanders now passes its memory test and uploads a new program. Implemented tst, or, jsr, rti, tst2, and 2 new movec ops. Added opbase handler to Plygonet driver.
- 0.127u6            : Andrew Gardner added additional Motorola DSP56k reset behavior.
- 0.127u5            : Rewrite of the Motorola DSP56k disassembler [Andrew Gardner]: Removes arbitrary opcode groupings in favor of flat decode model. Fixes a number of small issues with unknown opcodes. Added the final ALU parallel move ops. Fixes branch relative offset decoding.

- 0.110u5            : Improvements to the Polygonet Commanders driver [Andrew Gardner]: Implemented various dsp56k opcodes. Polygonet Commanders now gets past the memory tests.
- 27th November  2006: Andrew Gardner - As far as the network error (in the network) goes, it should be fairly straightforward to fix up - there remain a hearty hunk of writes that aren't going anywhere, and who knows, maybe I can convince Arbee to take another look at this'shizzle after i touch up a few more unimplemented dsp56k opcodes...
- 0.110u1            : Polygonet Commanders update [Andrew Gardner]: Added more accurate host interface to dsp56k core. Removed a bunch of hacks in plygonet.c.
- 0.106u6            : Improvements to Polygonet Commanders [R. Belmont]: Fixed Z80 IRQ/NMIs to go to the right CPU again, modernized memory map and added network status bit, so the initial test passes well enough to make the DSP56k crash on unimplemented opcodes.
- 11th June      2006: R. Belmont - Polygonet Commanders now passes POST again and now hits unimplemented opcodes in the 56156 DSP. Over to you, Andrew.
- 0.106u1            : Some improvements to the Polygonet Commanders driver [Andrew Gardner]: Adds change_PC() calls to the dsp56k core, removed hacky dsp56k initialization, enabling and disabling, added preliminary implementation of banking hardware tied to the dsp56k in Polygonet Commanders.
- 0.104u5            : Some small improvements to the Polygonet Commanders driver [Andrew Gardner]. Added DSP56156 (10MHz) CPU2 and K054539 (48000 Hz) sound.
- 0.99u6             : Renamed (dsp56kdasm.c) to (dsp56dsm.c) and (dsp56kops.c) to (dsp56ops.c).
- 0.99u3             : Added cpu\dsp56k\dsp56k.c/h, dsp56kops.c and dsp56kdasm.c. Andrew Gardner added DSP56k CPU core and hooked it up to the Polygonet Commanders driver.
- 15th July      2005: Andrew Gardner - The Motorola (now Freescale Semiconductor - Motorola owned them at the time) DSP56k series of processor is a strange beast in many ways... Nothing too crazy - variable length opcodes, strange decoding criteria, a few addressing modes, but honestly nothing to offer too much opposition for the would-be conqueror... To save you the trouble of guessing why I'd be writing a CPU core for such a thing (and why I'd mention R. Belmont and his infinite benevolence), here's the system16 link to the arcade games that use it : http://www.system16.com/konami/hrdw_polygonet.html (Konami's Polygonet Hardware). Polygonet Commanders is currently in MAME as a non-working driver and Belmont's got the sound hooked up and some hacks to get the thing to pass its memory tests. Then it stops ticking... I haven't looked at why it stops working yet, but I'm guessing it has something to do with the giant hole where a DSP56156 CPU core should be! Anyways, to my knowledge, the other game on the hardware, Poly-Net Warriors, has not been dumped (I'd be impressed if someone out there has even seen it in person), so it looks like it's just me and Polygonet. If anyone knows of any other interesting things that use a DSP56156 (so I can bug-squish the core some more) - feel free to mail me - I'll pass your knowledge on via this page and hopefully enhance the core using it... But here's the news : last night I finally managed to make the first real strides towards a truly working DSP56156 core in MAME. I removed a single memory-test hack Belmont put into the polygonet driver. Basically, the 68000 used to send a message to a nonexistent DSP56156. This message went nowhere, but Arbee knew the message was going to result in the DSP56156 filling a portion of memory with some simple values, and instead filled the proper piece of memory (using hard-coded C) with data the 68000 was expecting. Now, when the 68000 sends that message, it gets received (via a communications hack I put in :P) by the DSP56k core and it whirrs up, runs a few dozen opcodes, and fills the memory with the proper information! Now this may not seem all that interesting, and I can't show cool screen shots to back up the work, but rest assured, I'm totally stoked over the fact that my DSP56156 is running in tandem with a 68000, and they're actually getting along :)... Next on the todo list is to get the second memory test un-hacked. This is going to be a lot trickier though, as I'm going to need to do some arithmetic on the chip, and it seems to have a somewhat strange way of handling math in its 40-bit accumulator buffers.

4.    Signetics

4.1   S2650

- 0.187              : I/O modernization. Replaced fake S2650_SENSE_PORT address with line read callback (set_input_line should also work). There are still some doubts regarding whether VBLANK should be inverted in various drivers. Replaced fake S2650_CTRL_PORT and S2650_DATA_PORT addresses with... well, these aren't dedicated parallel ports, so they actually haven't gone away. They have, however, been moved to a new 1-bit address space, since the ports share the main data bus and are distinguished from each other by an address line. Allow program counter to be properly tracked by debugger. A few small status register-related refinements [AJR].
- 0.180              : Changed the S2650 disassembler to use 'std::ostream &' internally [Nathan Woods].
- 0.176              : Removed irq_line methods from S2600 and replace uses with DEVCB_INPUTLINE [AJR].

Replaced FLAG fake IO port with a DEVCB2 callback. Fixed placement of some MCFG_S2650_FLAG_HANDLER entries (drivers\dkong.c and zac_1/2.c) [smf]. Fixed recent S2650 regression in Galaxia driver [hap].
- 0.151              : Wilbert Pol fixed problem with S2650 uninitialized member in debug builds.

- 0.134u1            : S2650 improvements [Couriersud]: Added S2650_FO_PORT fake port for flag output line. Made CHECK_IRQ_LINE an inline. Verified irq handling (with help from Quench).
- 0.128u4            : Pointer-"ified" the S2650 core [Couriersud].
- 0.122u5            : Zsolt Vasvari fixed 2650 disassembly of the sense and flag bits. Fixed incorrect argument order in OUT instruction. Corrected spacing.

- 0.107u1            : Minuous fixed a S2650 register overflow bug.
- 0.101u2            : Aaron Giles added save state support to the S2650 CPU.
- 0.98u3             : Improvements to the S2650 core [Manfred Schneider]: Fixed LPSU opcode. Changed cycle counts to match technical documentation.
- 0.89u6             : Juergen Buchmueller updated S2650 CPU core to count more accurate clock cycle counts.
- 10th June      2002: Aaron Giles fixed the clock speeds in some games that use the S2650 CPU.
- 31st May       2000: Mike Coates fixed the Zaccaria 2650 games to work with MAME 0.37b3.

- 19th August    1999: Mike Coates fixed a bug in S2650 which made Hunchback miscalculate things, and sent in a driver for Hunchback running on Donkey Kong hardware.
- 0.33b6             : Added s2650\s2650.c/h, s2650cpu.h and 2650dasm.c. Signetics 2650 emulator [Juergen Buchmueller].
- GAMES: Lazer Command (Meadows Games 1976), Meadows Lanes (Meadows Games 1977), The Invaders and Super Invader Attack (Zaccaria/Zelco 197?), Dead Eye (Meadows 1978), Gypsy Juggler (Meadows 1978), Hunchback (Century 1983), Herbie at the Olympics (CVS 1984)

5.    Cinematronics CPU

- 0.180              : Changed the CCPU disassembler to use 'std::ostream &' internally [Nathan Woods].
- 0.170              : Latching of external_input makes "state_string_export() const" to work by Juergen [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.149u1            : Changed name 'CCPU' to 'Cinematronics CPU'. Modernized CCPU cpu core [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.128u5            : Pointer-ified the CCPU core [Aaron Giles].
- 0.123u4            : Aaron Giles fixed CCPU and QB-3 to no longer rely on cpu_scalebyfcount(). Fixed busted timing in the CCPU core. Changed watchdog to count internally rather than using external watchdog support. Altered CCPU to accept interrupt signals from the driver. Updated clocks in the cinemat driver to be derived from the clock crystal.
- 0.109u5            : Aaron Giles converted the CCPU disassemblers to the new format and added step in/out support where it was obvious.
- 0.87u3             : Removed cpu\ccpu\ccputabl.c.
- 11th October   2004: Aaron Giles - I started looking into adding QB-3 to the Cinematronics vector game driver when I realized that I was going to have to make changes to the CCPU core to actually get the game up and running.
- 0.78u4             : CPUs with an implicit address shift (e.g., the TMS34010 shifts addresses right 3 bits; the TMS32031 shifts addresses left 2 bits) now automatically get that shift applied to addresses in their memory maps and in calls to install_memory_read/write_handler(). This eliminates many ugly macros in the memory maps. Affected CPU cores are the ADSP210x, CCPU, PIC16C5x, TMS3201x, TMS3202x, TMS32031, and TMS340x0. Note that the CPU cores themselves still need to pass shifted values to the core read/write routines. All drivers using these cores have had their icky macros and bitshifts removed. * Harvard architecture CPUs now have data memory fully implemented now. Affected CPUs are the ADSP210x, TMS3201x, TMS3202x, PIC16C5x, and CCPU. All cores have been modified to fully split program and data memory. All drivers using these cores now specify explicit program and data memory maps. This also gets rid of a ton of ugly macros used in memory maps [Aaron Giles].
- 0.37b9             : The CCPU core is now a full 16-bit core. Appropriate changes to the drivers that use them have already been made. This fixes the input ports on the Cinematronics games [Aaron Giles].
-  6th September 2000: Brad Oliver fixed a small bug in the CCPU core.
- 0.35b10            : Removed cpu\ccpu\cinedbg.c.
- 0.35b9             : Removed cpu\ccpu\ccpu.new.
- 0.35b8             : Changed name 'C-CPU' to 'CCPU'. Added cpu\ccpu\ccpu.new.
- 0.35b6             : Added cpu\ccpu\ccpu.c/h, ccputabl.c, ccpudasm.c and cinedbg.c.

6.    Intel


6.1   I4004

- 0.188              : Changed cpu\i4004\i4004.cpp/h and 4004dasm to cpu\mcs40\mcs40.cpp/h and mcs40dasm.cpp. Rewrote 4004 core and disassembler: Renamed to MCS-40. Emulated 8-clock instruction cycle, interruptible at any point. Converted TEST input to an input line. Added SYNC and CM output lines. Added support for 4040 CY output, logical operations, extended registers, ROM banking and disassembly. Made I/O space mapping more flexible to support the variety of peripherals available. Notable missing features are 4040 interrupt and halt, and "program memory" space. MCS-40 update: Make disassembler/debugger use syntax closer to what ASL accepts. Use 2D lookup to make debugger tables more compact. Allow 4-bit registers to be set independently. Save state fixes. Implemented WPM/RPM instructions. Expose some signals from a 4008/4009 or 4289. Can't use opram when program and opcodes are not related in the slightest. Check for disabled side-effects! Better reflection of 4289 timings for performing program read/write. Added support for 4040 stop/ack and HLT instruction, hook up stop/single step buttons in (MESS) INTELLEC 4/MOD 40. MCS-40 updates: Splitted ROM and RAM port address spaces. Splitted RAM memory and status address spaces (no more read/modify/write). Fixed bug in FIN handling. Exposed cycle callback [Vas Crabb].
- 0.186              : Changed name 'Intel I4004' to 'Intel 4004'.

6.31  I8039 / MCS-48

- 0.186              : Converted MCS-48 ports to devcb: T0, T1 and PROG handlers are now 1-bit rather than 8-bit. Eliminate several T0/T1 handlers that DEVCB macros can take care of now. T0 CLK output emulation (untested) [AJR].
- 0.180              : Changed the MCS48 disassembler to use 'std::ostream &' internally [Nathan Woods].
- 0.154              : Fixed usage of uninitialized member in mcs48_cpu_device [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.150              : Modernized MCS-48 cpu core [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.148u1            : Added a default handler to the disasm switch/case (cpu\mcs48\mcs48dsm.c) [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.144u5            : Curt Coder fixed I8021/I8022 clock divider (MCS48).
- 0.129              : Merged i8x41 (UPI-41) core into MCS-48 core [Aaron Giles]: All code now lives in mcs48.c. Rewrote disassembler as unified MCS-48/UPI-41 disassembler. Changed UPI-41 interfaces to match MCS-48. Added new master read/write interfaces for external access. Unified interface to 8243 expander chip. Converted tnzs and decocass to the new interfaces. Some minor MCS-48 cleanup. Added 8040/8050 variants. Aaron Giles changed videopkr MCS-48 P4 control register to the PROG line, which is more likely. The way to toggle the PROG line is to read/write/and/or to ports 4-7. Since the board doesn't list an 8243 port expander, it is likely the "writes" to port 4 are really just a mechanism to get the PROG line to toggle to clear the interrupt. Aaron Giles removed bogus port 4-7 definitions from MCS-48. Added i8243 implementation. Connected 8243 properly to monsterb and system 16a sound. Changed draw80pkr to connect the PROG line like videopkr. Aaron Giles cleaned up MCS48 to be dependent on a single makefile define, rather than separate defines for each CPU which didn't really buy us anything in terms of code size or performance.
- 0.128u5            : Aaron Giles fixed most sets using MCS48/51.C: Fatal Error when using -cheat trigger.
- 0.128u4            : Switched MCS48 to new memory functions [Couriersud].
- 0.128u3            : Couriersud converted the MCS-48 core to reference data via pointers.
- 0.127u5            : Aaron Giles fixed AF calculation in MCS48.
- 0.127u3            : Aaron Giles fixed memory handling of internal banks. They should be LOWER priority than the driver's memory maps. Reverted recent changes to MCS-48 core that were very hacky and which crashed many games. You can now properly override the internal memory map and do your own banking.
- 0.127u2            : Couriersud changed MCS-48 core to write p1 and p2 on reset. Use banking to handle EA line. Added MCS48_INTERNAL_ROMBANK define to header. Drivers which need to control the EA line have to initialize banking for internal/external rom. This is not yet optimal but works as expected with existing drivers and modified mario.c. Changed MCS-48 EA line handling to use an explicit bank for now. Aaron Giles changed all MCS-48 chips to have a 12-bit address space, regardless of internal ROM size.
- 0.127u1            : i8039 -> mcs48 [Aaron Giles]. Changed cpu\i8039\i8039.c/h and 8039dasm.c to cpu\mcs48\mcs48.c/h and mcs48dsm.c. Significant cleanup/rewrite of the MCS-48 CPU core [Aaron Giles]: Renamed from i8039 to mcs48. Changed to use data address space for internal RAM. Added internal memory maps for variants with internal RAM/ROM. Added a number of variants from documentation. Removed redundant and unused definitions from header file. Renamed constants and functions to be MCS48* prefixed. Re-verified all opcode behaviors and timing. Changed illegal opcodes to count 1 cycle to avoid infinite loops. Changed EA behavior so that it is a push from the driver instead of a pull on each opcode fetch (this may change further in the future). Reimplemented IRQ generation and timer behavior according to documentation. Updated all drivers accordingly. Fixed several uses of PULSE_LINE, which no longer works.
- 0.124u3            : Wilbert Pol fixed I8039 DAA instruction when A is > 0xF9.
- 0.122u6            : Couriersud fixed regression on i8039 T1 counter mode. i8039.c/mario.c updates [Couriersud]: Fixed movd instructions. Add MB8884 and M58715 cpu types. Moved timer hack to M58715. Added ram_mask for internal ram access. Added R.A11 as 'M' to DASM flags. Added EA "IO" port. mario now uses M58715 as sound cpu. Hooked up EA line for M58715. Fixed portA startup value. Documented hardware changes to use a I8039 on a mario board.
- 0.121u3            : Couriersud corrected a potential issue if more than one 8039/8035 is used by a driver. Also should fix a potential inconsistency between saving and loading a state.

Changed to a single HAS_808X define for both cores. Fixed several drivers that used 8080/8085 interrupts in odd ways.
- 0.128u6            : Miodrag Milanovic fixed EI handling in the 8080/85 core to have a shadow like the Z80.
- 0.128u5            : Miodrag Milanovic fixed 8080 interrupt handling: 1. Previous implementation cleared interrupt enable bit on interrupt trigger which is wrong since interrupts should stay enabled. 2. Service interrupt number was not cleared after interrupt is executed, so if same one is triggered it will not be catched.
- 0.127u5            : Miodrag Milanovic fixed all drivers using a 8080 CPU: 8080 core has problem with score/credit counts and other variables.
- 0.127u3            : 8080/8085 CPU core updates [Miodrag Milanovic]: ANA/ANI instruction, HF flag was not set right because error in calculation of it (missing brackets). 8080 have NF flag always set (it is not used flag but bit is always set). Added support for status output lines.

- 0.133u4            : Intel 8085 [Curt Coder]: Refactored callbacks to use DEVCB.
- 0.133u3            : 8085 changes [hap]: Fixed cycle deduction on unconditional CALL / RET, it took about half too many cycles. Added cycle tables and cleaned up source layout. This was done very carefully, it should be errorfree. Removed HLT cycle eating (earlier, HLT after EI could theoretically fail). Fixed parity flag on add/sub/cmp. Bug was caused by Z80 overflow detection accidentally left in. Renamed temp register XX to official name WZ. Renamed flags from Z80 style S Z Y H X V N C  to  S Z X5 H X3 P V C and fixed X5 / V flags where accidentally broken due to flag names confusion.

Changed to a single HAS_808X define for both cores. Fixed several drivers that used 8080/8085 interrupts in odd ways. Aaron Giles added the concept of a cpu_state_table, which is supplied by the CPU cores and which describes all the register state accessible to the debugger and other subsystems. The format of the table is such that most data can be simply fetched from memory without the further involvement of the CPU core, including the display of common formats. Extensibility points are available for custom display and for importing/exporting the data to intermediate variables for more complicated scenarios. Updated the 8085 core to use this.
- 0.128u6            : Curt Coder added INTE and state word callbacks to i8085. Pointer-ified the i8085 CPU core [Aaron Giles]. Miodrag Milanovic fixed EI handling in the 8080/85 core to have a shadow like the Z80.

- 0.122u7            : i8085.c updates [Couriersud]: 8085 has an internal clock divider by 2. Changed i8085.c to reflect this for I8085. I8080 still at 1. Changed driver clocks to reflect internal clock divider. Added some FIXME: Comments where clocks for I8085 are outside specs. Zsolt Vasvari fixed saving I8085 callbacks across a reset. Added 'pull' callback for the SID pin. This is needed by the Red Alert voice board.

Previously, if pages were not ordered in contiguous RAM, then a cross-boundary read or write would read partially incorrect data or write some of the data in the wrong page. Oliver Stoeneberg gave some fatalerror() calls in the i386 proper messages.
- 0.136u4            : Small fix for the i386 core, correcting the LLDT instruction. This fixed sets up the LDTR base and limit values correctly, fixing use of the LDT [Barry Rodewald]. John R. Hauser added MAME-ified version of SoftFloat library (lib\softfloat\softfloat.c). NOTE (R. Belmont): There's no portable way to use the host's FPU for high-precision floating point. GCC has extensions which map to Intel's 80-bit extended floats, but support on non-x86/x64 is sketchy and MSVC doesn't support floats > 32 bits at all. I plan to use SoftFloat for the 68030/040 FPU up front, but it will also be useful in the future for emulating the 386/486/Pentium/etc FPUs (Bochs uses it for exactly that purpose).
- 0.136u1            : Improved i386 CPU accuracy of the various emulated models, makes CPU detection programs detect the correct CPU (in MESS) [Dirk Best]: eflags mask added.

- 0.135u1            : i386 core fixes [Barry Rodewald]: Added Nested Task flag, and I/O Privilege flags. They aren't implemented in any way, but can now be set or reset. Can be used to detect a 80386 or later CPU. Implemented ENTER instruction. Made IRQ vectors treated as 8 bytes when in protected mode, and made the addresses pushed onto the stack 32-bit if the gate descriptor used is a 386 interrupt or trap gate (also when in protected mode, will always be 16-bit if in real mode).
- 0.134u4            : Angelo Salese implemented I386 SLDT & STR opcodes.

- 0.136u4            : John R. Hauser added MAME-ified version of SoftFloat library (lib\softfloat\softfloat.c). NOTE (R. Belmont): There's no portable way to use the host's FPU for high-precision floating point. GCC has extensions which map to Intel's 80-bit extended floats, but support on non-x86/x64 is sketchy and MSVC doesn't support floats > 32 bits at all. I plan to use SoftFloat for the 68030/040 FPU up front, but it will also be useful in the future for emulating the 386/486/Pentium/etc FPUs (Bochs uses it for exactly that purpose).

- 0.104u4            : Aaron Giles fixed the debugger errors out when you try to run a game using the i960 cpu core. It displays the following error "disasm_generate_bytes: unknown size = 32".)
- 0.88u1             : R. Belmont and Stephan Cecchinel fixed errors in atanr and logepr opcode.
- 0.88               : ElSemi fixed bug in movl opcode.
- 17th October   2004: R. Belmont - ElSemi found a major i960 core bug. That combined with some work I was doing to make a lot of the Model 2 games run better.
- 0.87u2             : i960 updates [R. Belmont]: Added spanbit. Fixed error noted by ElSemi in spanbit and scanbit. Added non-queued interrupts to support games with the interrupt table in ROM (this fixes the colors and hanging in Sky Target, and Pilot Kids will need it too). Added the ability for read/write handlers to declare themselves "noburst", for memory regions which don't auto-increment the address on i960 bulk transfers. General cleanup of the interrupt handling to remove duplicated code. There should be no functional difference. Hack to make Last Bronx run while I track down an i960 core bug that's haunting it.
- 0.87u1             : i960 updates [R. Belmont]. Added support for the following opcodes: nor, addc, subc, atanr, sinr, cosr, tanr, atanrl, logrl, sinrl, cosrl and tanrl.

Fixed cmpr and cmprl - they were comparing garbage instead of the correct registers. Added disassembly for movrl. Added scanbit. Rewrote flushreg, it was *totally* wrong before. HOTD now runs, among others. Added hack to divo so divide by zero doesn't crash MAME (some games read back 0 from the not-yet-existing DSP and do this). More disassembler improvements. Added NAND, EDIV, SCALER, SCALERL, ROUNDR, ROUNDRL, EXPRL, MOVRE, and CPYSRE opcodes. Fixed some errors in interrupt handling. Solves corrupt graphics in fvipers and crashes in fvipers, schamp and dynamcop. Added REMR opcode.
- 29th September 2004: R. Belmont - Added Sky Target (which refuses to set it's palette properly - go figure). Also fixed an i960 core bug that was causing crashes and corrupt graphics in Fighting Vipers and Sonic Championship, among other things.
- 27th September 2004: R. Belmont - A few games that needed some additional i960 core work...Daytona USA, Gunblade, Topskater, Virtual One and Desert Tank.
- 25th September 2004: R. Belmont - You have the right to remain silent! (3 "cop" themed games are now running) - Dynamite Cop, vcop. Actually, being silent is boring so I added sound to all the Model 2 games.
- 24th September 2004: R. Belmont - Even more Model 2 and i960 work... dynabb, The House of The Dead, fvipers, schamp, Zero Gunner and vf2.
- 22nd September 2004: R. Belmont - More Model 2 and i960 work (no new pictures yet, but many more games now start up - Speed Racer). A very nice side effect of the i960 work has surfaced however...
- 21st September 2004: R. Belmont - Added a bunch of i960 opcodes and started picking up one of the pieces left by Olivier Galibert's disk failure (Sega Model 2). Indy 500, Behind Enemy Lines and Virtua Striker will going to be a "Modeler" style driver until further notice. 2D layers, inputs and sound/music only, IOW.
- 0.85u1             : R. Belmont fixed debugger crash when using F10 with the i960 core.
- 0.84u2             : More i960 bugfixes [R. Belmont]: Fixed a brown-paper-bag bug where the PC and AC registers were getting swapped on return from interrupts. Rewrote the frame cache mechanism using a simple FIFO concept (Final Lap R now runs further). Aligned reads and writes now use the full-size paths through the core instead of always breaking everything down into bytes.
- 0.84u1             : R. Belmont fixed bugs in the i960 concmpo, concmpi and modi instructions. Added "text" and hex displays of the AC register for debugging. Added TESTx opcodes to the disassembler.
- 0.82               : Olivier Galibert added a bunch of i960 floating point opcodes and stylistic fixes.

- 0.151              : New AM_(DEV)SETOFFSET feature for address maps (Specifies a handler for a 'set address' operation. The intended use case for this operation is to emulate a split-phase memory access: The caller (usually a CPU) sets the address bus lines using set_address. Some component may then react, for instance, by asserting a control line like WAIT before delivering the data on the data bus. The data bits are then sampled on the read operation or delivered on the write operation that must be called subsequently. It is not checked whether the address of the set_address operation matches the address of the subsequent read/write operation. The address map translates the address to a bucket and an offset, hence the name of the macro. If no handler is specified for a bucket, a set_address operation hitting that bucket returns silently).

7.53  TMS32031

- 0.186              : TMS3203x RTPS should be RPTS [Philip Bennett].
- 0.184              : Removed direct update handler [O. Galibert].
- 0.180              : Changed the TMS3203x disassembler to use 'std::string get_indirect [Nathan Woods].

- 0.155              : Removed static configs in favor of inline config+devcb [Fabio Priuli].
- 0.147u4            : Added internal boot loader programs to the TMS3203x core and support a switch between microcomputer (bootloader) and microprocessor modes via the TMS3203X_MCBL input. This is required for Rise of the Robots, whose boot code jumps into the middle of the bootloader ROM. Changes tested with primrage, sfrush and speedup [Phil Bennett].
- 0.146u5            : hap fixed edge cases with overflow/carry flag (cpu\tms32031\32031ops.c) and fixed warnings.
- 0.146u4            : hap fixed OR_C_ADD(a,b,r) opcode, SUB is left-to-right, ADD is equal both ways (cpu\tms32031\32031ops.c).
- 0.146u2            : Two TMS32031 fixes [Daniel Filner]: Don't set underflow when doing a floating point subtract that results in 0. Don't overwrite the exponent during a FIX operation. This fixed Off Road Challenge - Game now playable.
- 0.141u2            : Aaron Giles converted TMS3203X to a modern device.
- 0.128u4            : Pointer-ified the TMS32031 core [Aaron Giles].
- 0.125u9            : Aaron Giles fixed TMS32031 so that it doesn't call the debugger if not enabled.
- 0.122u2            : TMS3203x core updates [Aaron Giles]: Fixed interrupt handling. Added support for edge-triggered interrupts on '32. Expanded interrupt support for the '32. Updated drivers using TMS3203x core to deassert interrupts. Added externally accessible functions for converting '3x floating point format. Updated gaelco3d driver to use new functions.
- 0.120u4            : Aaron Giles fixed TMS32031 ABSF opcode to work as documented and not produce a proper negative. Fixed display of floating point TMS32031 registers in the debugger.
- 0.120u2            : Aaron Giles added NORM implementation to the TMS32031 core.
- 0.113u3            : Couriersud added save state support to TMS32031.
- 0.109u5            : Aaron Giles converted the tms32031 disassemblers to the new format and added step in/out support where it was obvious.
- 0.102u1            : Aaron Giles added new inline math functions to mamecore.h, along with mechanisms for the OSD layer to override them with platform-specific variants: count_leading_zeros, count_leading_ones, and fixed_mul_shift. Updated the TMS32031 core to make use of the first two.
-  2nd March     2004: Aaron Giles - After getting Radikal Bikers working well, I decided to figure out what was up with Surf Planet. Turns out they were relying on unspecified behavior of the TMS32031 by placing a CALL statement at the end of a repeat block. They tell you several times in the docs for the CPU never to do this, but hey, I guess if it works more power to them. With that fixed and some rendering tweaks, I'm currently getting about 30-50% of full speed on my 3GHz machine. If I turn off bilinear filtering and run at half resolution, both games are playable near 100%. Of course, I don't have the sound working yet, and that will kill the speed nicely (it's a DCS-like ADSP chip, sorry!).
- 0.79u3             : Aaron Giles fixed a TMS32031 bug that was causing some problems in Radikal Bikers.
- 24th February  2004: Aaron Giles - Fixed a subtle bug in the TMS32031 core that was causing problems with Radikal Bikers. Now at least all the geometry shows up okay. I'm still at a loss to explain alpha blending, Z buffering, or perspective correction. The incomplete driver should be in u2, so if you know some 3D math, feel free to have a look and see if you can't help me figure it out!
- 0.79u2             : Aaron Giles added support for the IACK and IDLE commands in the TMS32031 CPU core.
- 24th February  2004: Aaron Giles - Fixed a subtle bug in the TMS32031 core that was causing problems with Radikal Bikers. Now at least all the geometry shows up okay.

The incomplete driver should be in u2, so if you know some 3D math, feel free to have a look and see if you can't help me figure it out!
- 0.78u4             : CPUs with an implicit address shift (e.g., the TMS34010 shifts addresses right 3 bits; the TMS32031 shifts addresses left 2 bits) now automatically get that shift applied to addresses in their memory maps and in calls to install_memory_read/write_handler(). This eliminates many ugly macros in the memory maps. Affected CPU cores are the ADSP210x, CCPU, PIC16C5x, TMS3201x, TMS3202x, TMS32031, and TMS340x0. Note that the CPU cores themselves still need to pass shifted values to the core read/write routines. All drivers using these cores have had their icky macros and bitshifts removed [Aaron Giles].
- 0.77               : TMS32031 fixes [Aaron Giles]: Many fixes to the TMS32031 core; Offroad Challenge is almost playable as a result, minus the fact that the clipping plane seems to like clipping out the cars during the race. But the terrain problems are fixed at least.
-  6th November  2003: Aaron Giles fixed the unmapped memory access logging to show the effective address (taking the address shift into account on CPUs like TMS34010 or TMS32031).
-  5th November  2003: Aaron Giles improved the TMS32031 core a lot, making Offroad Challenge almost playable.
-  8th December  2002: Aaron Giles fixed a lot of things in the TMS32031 CPU core.
- 0.62               : Added cpu\tms32031\tms32031.c/h and 32031ops.c and dis32031.c. TMS32031 CPU emulation [Aaron Giles].
- 28th October   2002: Aaron Giles sent in a TMS32031 CPU core and Williams V-Unit driver supporting Cruis'n USA and Cruis'n World complete with perfect sound emulation. P4 - 4 GHz or Athlon XP 4000+ recommended.

7.55  TMS32051

- 0.181              : Removed address_spacenum. That's an elaborate way to do a nop [O. Galibert].
- 0.180              : Changed the TMS32051 disassembler to use 'std::ostream &' internally [Nathan Woods].
- 0.174              : Changed cpu\tms32051\32051ops.inc to 32051ops.hxx.
- 0.170              : More TMS32051 bug fixes (32051ops.inc, dis32051.cpp and tms32051.cpp/h). Fixed accumulator conditions (32051ops.inc) [Ville Linde].
- 0.169              : Added TMS32053 CPU. Hook up TMS32053 DSP to Taito Power-JC System driver. Added TMS32051 idle instruction and I/O space. TMS32051 various fixes. TMS32051 disasm fixes [Ville Linde].
- 0.155              : Poking around with Dangerous Curves (cpu\tms32051\tms32051.c). Added op_add_s16_mem and op_bldd_sbmar (tms32051\32051ops.c) [hap].
- 0.153              : Modernized TMS32051 cpu core [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.146u4            : hap fixed add/sub overflow/carry flags (tms32051/32051ops.c). OV flag is cleared on (OV-)branch-and-call instructions. On 'C2x-compatible opcodes that set treg(0), treg1/2 are set too if TRM=0. Some cleanup. Simplify add/sub a bit.
- 0.146u3            : Stack emulation is more accurate now. Make it obvious that some of the reset code is a hack cause of missing internal rom. Small optimization on condition checks [hap].
- 0.143u4            : Angelo Salese fixed TMS32051 debug memory viewer. Work-around for TMS32051 crash on Taito JC system soft reset. Fixed a debugger crash if you try to view data memory in TMS32051.
- 0.128u6            : Pointer-ified the TMS32051 CPU core [Aaron Giles].
- 0.111u2            : Taito JC driver improvements [Ville Linde]: Various bug fixes and some new opcodes to the TMS320C51 core. Moved video hardware emulation to video\taitojc.c. Implemented 3D hardware emulation.
- 25th December  2006: Ville Linde - One of the most interesting parts of the Taito 3D hardware is the math co-processor that has been integrated into one of the Taito custom chips. The coprocessor does two functions. The first function does 3D point projection to 2D, and was quite straightforward to understand from the DSP disassembly. The second function however, required a lot more head scratching. Eventually I figured out that this function is used to calculate polygon intersection calculations while clipping the polygons against the viewport. The reason why yet another math unit is needed may not be clear at first. But once you look at how the math functions work, it becomes more clear. Both of the math functions are dividing something, and a quick look at the TMS320C51 datasheet reveals that it doesn't have a division unit at all. The emulation of the math co-processor, coupled with some additional TMS320C51 bug fixes gives us almost perfectly working 3D.
- 17th December  2006: Ville Linde - I've been working on fixing bugs in the TMS320C51 core and trying to understand the 3D hardware in Taito's JC System. So far I've managed to figure out the polygon format and texture mapping. As a result Side by Side 2 already shows the road polygons and some other stuff.
- 0.107u3            : Taito JC update [Ville Linde]: Some general improvements to the driver. Added some more opcodes to the TMS320C51 core.
- 0.106u9            : Improved the TMS320C51 core [Ville Linde].
- 0.105u1            : Added cpu\tms32051\tms32051.c/h, dis32051.c and 32051ops.c/h. Added TMS320C51 cpu core [Ville Linde].
- 10th April     2006: Ville Linde - I picked up the Taito JC System driver again in hopes of getting it to do something interesting. The two major roadblocks were the missing FPU stuff from the M68040 core and the missing TMS320C51 DSP core. The TMS DSP emulation already works well enough that the basic communication and ROM tests are already working. There's also enough of the 68040 FPU emulated that the games won't just crash when they hit FPU opcodes. None of the games still show anything interesting graphics-wise, but progress is progress nevertheless.

- 0.168              : Unsigned value can't be less than zero (m_tcount < 0) [Vas Crabb].
- 0.150              : Added cpu\tms32082\dis_mp.c and dis_pp.c. Removed dis32082.c. Another bunch of TMS32082 stuff. Improved vector op disasm and more disasm fixes. Added more opcodes. Added Parallel Processor + more MP opcodes. Splitted MP and PP disassembler. PP disassembler progress (tms32082\dis_pp.c). More PP disasm fixes (cpu\tms32082\dis_pp.c). MP interrupts and more PP disasm work. More MP opcodes [Ville Linde].
- 0.149u1            : Added cpu\tms32082\tms32082.c/h, dis32082.c and mp_ops.c. Groundworks for TMS320C82 core. Added internal address map and few opcodes. More improvements [Ville Linde].

7.6   TMS340xx

7.61  TMS34010

- 0.186              : Fixed DASM of MOVB/MOVE absolute to absolute [Robbbert].
- 0.180              : Changed the TMS34010 disassembler to use 'std::ostream &' internally [Nathan Woods].
- 0.174              : Changed cpu\tms34010\34010fld.inc, 34010gfx.inc, 34010ops.inc and 34010tbl.inc to 34010fld.hxx, 34010gfx.hxx, 34010ops.hxx and 34010tbl.hxx.
- 0.162              : Fixed moving TMS34010 CPU core to inline config in MAME 0.155, fixes "GSP TIME OUT ERROR" in harddriv, racedriv, steeltal, strtdriv and racedrivpan (ID 05911).
- 0.155              : Work around Clang shift overflow warnings (build\flags_clang.mak and 34010gfx.c) [Wilbert Pol]. Converted to use inline config, devcb and delegates [Osso]. Fixed compile on MSVC 2012 & 2013 (34010gfx.c) [Peter Ferrie]. Disabled -Wconstant-logical-operand again for Clang and tms34010\34010gfx.c cleanups [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.154              : Fixed issue with Battletoads (cpu\tms34010\34010gfx.c), but re-break some gfx in Little Robin/Mega Phoenix in the process. Needs somebody who knows the TMS better [David Haywood]. Use the CONVSP/CONVDP registers to adjust source and destination addresses when window clipping or y-reverse is applied (cpu\tms34010\34010gfx.c). Mirrored TMS34010 RAM at 0x7fc00000 and 0xffc00000 in machine\inder_vid.c. With the previous TMS34010 change, this fixes the window clipping issues at y=0 [Phil Bennett]. Modernised TMS34010 cpu core [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.153              : Make the TMS34010 a bit safer when 8-bit writes are used (Mega Phoenix does this). I suspect Skeet Shot will need more improvements along these lines because it's hooked up to an 8-bit CPU? This at least means we don't have to overclock the 68k by a silly amount on Mega Phoenix, and fixes round 4, although it doesn't fix all the graphic corruption, of note round 6 [David Haywood].
- 0.150              : Placed some of screen update functions in TMS34010 cpu core classes as result removed some scrlegcy.h includes [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.148u2            : Fixed Clang warning in cpu\tms34010\34010gfx.c:1518:14: warning: shift count >=width of type [-Wshift-count-overflow] [Phil Bennett].
- 0.144u6            : Major bitmap-related changes throughout the system [Aaron Giles]. Added independent ind16 and rgb32 callbacks for TMS340x0 devices.
- 0.138u1            : Couriersud fixed TMS34010 memory window jumps to weird addresses when trying to view memory in all set of the Hard Drivin' driver.
- 0.137u2            : Alex Jackson fixed TMS34010 parameter in the Midway T-Unit driver.
- 0.128u7            : Aaron Giles added the concept of a cpu_state_table, which is supplied by the CPU cores and which describes all the register state accessible to the debugger and other subsystems. The format of the table is such that most data can be simply fetched from memory without the further involvement of the CPU core, including the display of common formats. Extensibility points are available for custom display and for importing/exporting the data to intermediate variables for more complicated scenarios. Updated the TMS340x0 core to use this.
- 0.128u6            : Atari Ace modified the tms34010.h interface to eliminate some more global Machine variables. More deprecat.h includes eliminated.
- 0.128u4            : Aaron Giles converted TMS340x0 cores to be pointer-based.
- 0.123u5            : Zsolt Vasvari changed TMS34010 to take a screen tag instead of screen number.
- 0.115u1            : Aaron Giles added support for misaligned PIXBLT operations in the TMS34010 core. The code still needs cleanup but improves the new JPM driver.
- 0.114u4            : Aaron Giles simplified register and flags management in the TMS34010 core. Reviewed all flag handling and fixed a couple of minor discrepancies.
- 0.114u2            : Aaron Giles cleaned up internal interrupt handling in the TMS34010 core.
- 0.114u1            : Aaron Giles substantially changed the TMS340x0 interfaces to allow the CPU emulator to directly manage the video screen. Glitches in several games are now fixed as a result (for example the flashing screens in NBA Jam are now gone at last).
- 0.113u3            : Phil Bennett changed the TMS340x0 core to clear the HSTCTLH NMI bit on an acknowledge. Phil Bennett fixed display of immediate word and long operands in the TMS340x0 disassembler.
- 0.113u1            : Zsolt Vasvari began converting drivers over to the new more accurate video timing functions (video_screen_* functions instead of cpu_*). This first batch includes all the games using the TMS34010 chip and the Atari games that use atarigen.c.
- 0.113              : Zsolt Vasvari removed cpu_gethorzbeampos() and replaced it with calls to video_screen_get_hpos(). Also changed TMS34010 configuration to take a screen number, and changed atarigen_get_hblank() to take a screen number as well.
- 0.109u5            : Aaron Giles converted the tms34010 disassemblers to the new format and added step in/out support where it was obvious.
- 0.96u3             : Aaron Giles fixed TMS34010 reverse blitters so they didn't perform extraneous source memory fetches.
- 0.96u2             : Aaron Giles fixed window mode 1 in the TMS34010 core, as well as bugs that prevented misaligned stack accesses from working and a bug that didn't force the PC to be 16-bit aligned.
- 0.96               : Added step in/out support to TMS34010 disassembler [Aaron Giles].
- 0.84u5             : Andrea Mazzoleni fixed memory crash in the TMS34010 core (removed an illegal free()).
-  3rd June      2004: Olivier Galibert fixed a save state crash that occurred in some games that use the TMS34010 CPU.
- 0.78u4             : CPUs with an implicit address shift (e.g., the TMS34010 shifts addresses right 3 bits; the TMS32031 shifts addresses left 2 bits) now automatically get that shift applied to addresses in their memory maps and in calls to install_memory_read/write_handler(). This eliminates many ugly macros in the memory maps. Affected CPU cores are the ADSP210x, CCPU, PIC16C5x, TMS3201x, TMS3202x, TMS32031, and TMS340x0. Note that the CPU cores themselves still need to pass shifted values to the core read/write routines. All drivers using these cores have had their icky macros and bitshifts removed [Aaron Giles].
-  6th November  2003: Aaron Giles fixed the unmapped memory access logging to show the effective address (taking the address shift into account on CPUs like TMS34010 or TMS32031).
- 0.75               : Aaron Giles removed 4x executes per loop which screwed up timing and fixed internal interrupt generation to get consistent timing results.

7.62  TMS34020

- 0.144u6            : Major bitmap-related changes throughout the system [Aaron Giles]. Added independent ind16 and rgb32 callbacks for TMS340x0 devices.
- 0.128u7            : Aaron Giles added the concept of a cpu_state_table, which is supplied by the CPU cores and which describes all the register state accessible to the debugger and other subsystems. The format of the table is such that most data can be simply fetched from memory without the further involvement of the CPU core, including the display of common formats. Extensibility points are available for custom display and for importing/exporting the data to intermediate variables for more complicated scenarios. Updated the TMS340x0 core to use this.

- 0.130              : Olivier Galibert added two missing instructions to TMS57002 and hack up the coef update. The real way coefficient updates are handled is a little too complex for now, but the hack throttles the update speed to the real rate given the way konami uses it (once per sync). It's near impossible to use it in a different way anyway.
- 0.129u6            : Don't abort on unimplemented TMS57002 instructions [Olivier Galibert].

8.3   HD63701

- 0.186              : Quick and dirty split of most MC6801/MC6803/HD63701 features from base M6800 class. The code remains generally archaic and awful and in need of a sweeping rewrite. At least one static variable is no more [AJR].
- 24th December  2010: Dr. Decapitator - The MCU (HD63701) from Double Dragon has been decapped. The readout matched the existing bootleg MCU dump in MAME, so the pirates in the 80's must have read it out correctly as opposed to coding their own. You can see a picture of it wired up for reading below.
- 11th July 2010     : Dr. Decapitator - Work has started on the 63701 that Technos used in Super Dodge Ball and Double Dragon. Below is a photo of the 63701 from Super Dodge Ball.

- 17th November  1999: Ernesto Corvi fixed sound in all the games using Namco sound system driven by a HD63701 (incl. Baraduke and Metrocross).
- 0.36b8             : Tatsuyuki Satoh finally fixed the CMPX instruction in the 680x core. On the 6800 it does not affect the C flag, on the others (6803, 63701) it does.
- 0.36b7             : Some fixes to HD63701 IRQ handling, and support for ICI (Input Capture Interrupt) [Tatsuyuki Satoh].

- 0.177              : Changed endianness of H8 ADC register (cpu\h8\h8_adc.cpp). This was broken in a rewrite a long time ago, breaking the controls in some Namco System 12 (and probably 23) games. This commit improves controls in golgo13, g13knd and technodr. H8 SCI improvements. This should hopefully prevent the sub CPU from locking up (and making controls unresponsive) in technodr [Superctr].
- 0.174              : Added cpu\h8\h8_dma.cpp/h, h8_dtc.cpp/h and h8_watchdog.cpp/h. Added DTC, DMA and watchdog to H8. Lot of fixes [O. Galibert].

Fixed enable handling in timers. Prettify registers/flags in debugger. For tools\unidasm.c we need to find a H8 solution there. Get some speed back in Namco System 23 driver. Implement the 8-bits timers, Namco System 23 coins work again [O. Galibert]. H8 dec16/inc16 fix [Fabio Priuli]. Fixed H8 build [Mike Naberezny]. Fixed integer constant is too large for 'long' type" error on GCC 4.4.7 [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.84u2             : Added cpu\h83002\h83002.c/h, h8disasm.c, h8periph.c and h8priv.h. Added a core for the Hitachi H8/3002 MCU [R. Belmont]. It was originally written by the Zinc authors The_Author & DynaChicken for Zinc. R. Belmont have fairly extensively rewritten it and adapted it to MAME semantics with their permission. Cycle counts are probably not right because the manual's a bit confusing, but they're at least ballpark.

- 0.186              : Added DMA channels and RTMCSR register to H8/3002 [BartmanAbyss].
- 0.177              : Updated H8/3002 frequency for namcos12 and namcos23. This is based on sound driver research, and comparing the H8/3002 ND-1/ND-2 programs with the System 12 and 23 programs. The figures are similar to the previously measured clock speeds so chances are the earlier values were just measurement error [Superctr].
- 0.153              : Added cpu\h8\h83002.c/h. Removed cpu\h83002\h8.h, h8_16.c, h8_8.c, h8disasm.c, h8ops.h, h8ops.h, h8periph.c, h8priv.h and h8speriph.c. H8 rewrite [O. Galibert].

- 0.103u3            : H8 update [R. Belmont]: Limited vector reads to 24 bits. Added SHLL.W, EXTU.L, SUBS.L #2, and SUBS.L #4 opcodes.
- 0.102u3            : Updated the H8/3002 emulation [R. Belmont]: Added more bXXX.b #imm, (@)Rn instructions. Added subtract with carry instructions.
- 0.99u1             : cync fixed several problems in the H8/3002 core. Improves sound in Namco System 12 and ND-1.
-  5th August    2005: R. Belmont - Got a nice present today from a coder who goes by cync: a set of major bugfixes to the H8/3002 CPU core. As you know, this is the "sub-CPU" in many later Namco games. So what do the fixes do? They correct most of what was wrong with the sound and music in all of the ND-1 (NCV1/NCV2) and System 12 games. All the games involved now sound way better, and of course I've already backported the fixes to ZiNc so the music's better there too. Paca Paca in ZiNc is now reasonably playable, since the music now actually sounds like music. And games that had decent sound before like Fighting Layer are pretty much perfect now. It's awesome. Thanks, cync!
- 0.95u6             : Fixed h8_group7 opcode (case 0x8) and disassembler.
- 0.86u3             : R. Belmont fixed H8/3002 btst #imm, @Rn instruction - it was giving reversed results, which crashed ncv2's MCU program.
-  2nd September 2004: R. Belmont - Fixed a bug in the H8/3002 CPU core. Got it on speaking terms with the 68000 on the Namco ND-1 hardware. Result: Namco Classics Collection volumes 1 and 2 are both fully playable with full sound and music.
- 0.86u1             : R. Belmont fixed endianness problem in H8/3002.
- 0.84u5             : R. Belmont fixed an issue in the H8/3002 core where the timer start register would mess up timers that were already running. Improves the music tempo for S12 games.
- 0.84u2             : Added cpu\h83002\h83002.c/h, h8disasm.c, h8periph.c and h8priv.h. Added a core for the Hitachi H8/3002 MCU [R. Belmont]. It was originally written by the Zinc authors The_Author & DynaChicken for Zinc. R. Belmont have fairly extensively rewritten it and adapted it to MAME semantics with their permission. Cycle counts are probably not right because the manual's a bit confusing, but they're at least ballpark.
-  8th July      2004: R. Belmont - More H8/3002 work. Rewrote the timers to use MAME's timer system so music speeds should be accurate now. Need to finish the ITU cleanup now.
-  4th July      2004: R. Belmont - The H8/3002 work continues along. I've fixed a ton of bugs that The_Author left in the original core now.
- 29th June      2004: R. Belmont - Started cleaning up ZiNc's H8/3002 core for MAME submission (this will add sound and fix protection on Namco Classics 1 & 2 and the System 12 games). Fixed some flag calculations on the ADD opcodes and some "edge cases" on the C352 to improve music in NCV1/2. Still need to fix some issues with the controls in Aqua Rush and Paca Paca.

Added H8/3007 & H8/3044 variants with their memory maps. Preliminary implementation of the H8/3007 timers.
- 22nd April     2007: Luca Elia - I've been working on two games by Taiwanese Subsino. They use the Hitachi H8/3044 CPU, which features an undumped internal ROM, and whose emulation in MAME is somewhat incomplete. Add to that a bit of protection, and the prospects of getting the games to work were limited. Fortunately, though, it looks like the internal ROM is not critical, as I got Bishou Jan (Smiling Jan) (Subsino 1999) to work, albeit with some issues. The video hardware is tilemap based. At the moment there is no sound: the sound chip is unknown, nor do I see sound related writes. Furthermore I had to slightly patch the interrupt routines, and skip what appears to be protection checks. I also had to fix/add the emulation of several instructions in the CPU core. The other Subsino game is Last Fighting, a Bomberman clone currently in MAME as non-working. Same CPU but different, blitter based, video hardware. I'm starting to implement that and, even if much work is still needed, I'm now hopeful to get it to run.
- NOTES: The H8/3044 is a H8/3002 with 24bit address bus and has 32k MASKROM and 2k RAM, clock input is 16.000MHz [32/2]. MD0,MD1 & MD2 are configured to MODE 6 16M-Byte Expanded Mode with the on-chip 32k MASKROM enabled.

8.6   Z180

- 0.186              : Added support for DREQ and TEND signals. Fixed DMA0 count and DREQ handling [BartmanAbyss]. Fixed obvious type detected by Coverity (software) [O. Galibert]. Tried to make Z180 table allocation/setup a bit safer [Vas Crabb].
- 0.184              : Correct MMOD bit for Z180 DMA [AJR]. Count of 0 means 0x10000, as with other DMA controllers. Fixed scheduling so burst mode DMA is always serviced immediately with no CPU ops interleaved [R. Belmont].
- 0.182              : Reconfigure Z80 daisy chain behavior to use the standard vector for an external IRQ, rather than a bogus one from the last device in the chain. Enabled Z80 daisy chain on Cedar Magnet sound board (fake IRQ still necessary, though vectors are correct now). Source note regarding IM 2 behavior contrary to Zilog datasheet (was fixed way back in 0.35b11). Simplify daisy-chain IRQ ack routine (get rid of delegate member) (cpu\z80\z80daisy.cpp) [AJR].
- 0.181              : Decapped, deprotected, dumped and hooked up the HD647180X MCUs for Vimana, Fire Shark and Teki Paki [CAPS0ff].
- 21st December  2016: CAPS0ff - Decapping HD647180. Includes: #19: Vimana HD647180 QFP80, #58: Teki Paki HD647180X QFP80 and #102: Fire Shark HD647180X QFP80. Decapping revealed an unknown film covering the die. Sometimes chips have polymide or silicone passivation. However, this material is white clear (not yellow polymide) and a dry film (not silicone). While decapping did not remove the film, it did loosen it. Several test chips were cleaned up by carefully pulling it off with tweezers. While this works, we were ideally looking for a solution that minimized poking near fragile bond wires. Another experiment showed that hot sulfuric acid removes the film. As the decap solution contains some sufuric acid (mostly white fuming nitric acid with a touch of sulfuric acid), it was suspected that letting it cook a bit longer would remove the film. This proved successful and we successfully cleaned a test die. Now that we finally have a clean die it was imaged for analysis. The dark area in the lower section of the die is our target: EPROM. The die image provides a good guess as to the location of the fuse lock bits. Upon closer inspection we learn the layout is similar to other previously deprotected Hitachi parts (not shown). Here it is on the HD647180. ROM is masked to protect our data, while leaving the fuse bits exposed during UV erasure. The helpful arcade community let us know someone had previously designed a breakout PCB for experimenting with HD647180 MCU. Very helpful! Success! To be sure, we masked basically everything but the suspected fuse. Which also worked. While PLCCs are great for early development (easy swap on dev board), the real chips are QFP (we don't have a socket). So basically went through the same decap process on QFP. And masked it to successfully read out the chip. After several successful QFP dumps it was time to move onto the real chips. Here's #56 decapped and masked. Deprotection succeeded, but the dumper hardware detected a continuity fault and the ROM was missing data bits D0, D1, and D3. Impedance check to ground verified we had a problem on those pins: While other D's read ~20k those were open. Closer visual inspection revealed a bond wire defect. Some gentle probing verifies D3 is in fact broken. After weighing options we repaired them with conductive epoxy. Success! We proceeded to decap and deprotect the rest of the HD647180s. Both #19 and #58 required repair. #102 failed continuity but dump seems okay. Interestingly enough, while all three Toaplan samples had serious bond wire defects, none of the test PLCC nor test QFP samples did (although harmless marks are barely visible). We suspect these defects are tooling marks from the bonding machine used to build the packages. We have been told this MCU is commonly found failed on Toaplan games, perhaps this is the reason.

-  6th January   2012: Charles MacDonald - I recently dumped the internal ROM for Wing's "7 Smash". The ROM was trojaned in a similar way to Pinkiri 8 and other Wing games that are now emulated in MAME. This board uses a HD647180 MCU (in a huge 90-pin SDIP package) with 16K of internal ROM and up to 128K of external ROM. The external ROM contains program code so it isn't particularly hard to get control of the system by inserting your own software into the ROM once you've made a NOP sled or identified the entry points. To get the internal ROM data out I used my 8-bit EPROM emulator which can also emulate RAMs. The two red wires in the picture are used to tap into the system reset signal from the MB3771 and part of the glue logic which generates a write strobe for memory locations. This allows the trojan program to write back into emulator memory to store data. Once it had copied the internal ROM to RAM (and generated a checksum) I just had to download the emulator RAM and that was it. If any more of these games come up in the future it should be fairly easy to get them dumped.
- 16th June      2010: Angelo Salese - Charles MacDonald extracted the internal ROM on the Eagle 909 HW games (Janshi, Ron Jan and Pinkiri 8). Me and Haze recently did some efforts to emulate this HW, that is a Z180 with a fancy video emulation (that isn't yet fully working). Janshi and Ron Jan have an original thought of the mahjong game, on which you can see what type of tile is with different tilesets for the back.
- 10th June      2010: Charles MacDonald - I trojaned the internal ROM from the CPU module used by "Pinkiri 8". This game uses an external program ROM that is not encrypted (like Lucky Girl was), so I used my 32K ROM emulator to run a small program that relocated to work RAM and copied the internal 16K ROM of the HD647180 CPU to the emulator RAM, and then saved that RAM to disk. The only hard part was probing around the board to find the circuit that generated the memory write strobe, and after that it was pretty easy. UPDATE: Turns out this method worked for three related boards Brian Troha sent earlier, so now those are all dumped too!
- 0.138u1            : Couriersud improved Z180 timer and HALT processing. This fixes severe slowdown after initials are entered in Ms. Pac-Man/Galaga - 20 Year Reunion. Rewrote Z180 cycle accounting to create a basis for more exact internal I/O and timer operations as well as implementing interrupt priorities. Removed unused BIG_SWITCH code as well. Improved Z180 interrupt and timer handling. Added some missing save state entries and fixed HALT.
- 0.135              : Phil Bennett fixed access violation in all drivers using Z180 CPU.

- 0.133u2            : hap removed DAA tables from the 8085 and Z180 implementations in favor of just computing the values. Also fixed code in 8085 to prevent accidental multiple reads due to macro overuse.
- 0.128u7            : Aaron Giles added the concept of a cpu_state_table, which is supplied by the CPU cores and which describes all the register state accessible to the debugger and other subsystems. The format of the table is such that most data can be simply fetched from memory without the further involvement of the CPU core, including the display of common formats. Extensibility points are available for custom display and for importing/exporting the data to intermediate variables for more complicated scenarios. Updated the Z180 core to use this.
- 0.128u6            : Pointer-ified the Z180 core [Aaron Giles].
- 0.122u8            : Zsolt Vasvari fixed reset crashes in all Z180 games. Removed the various busy loop and non-exact optimzations from the Z180 core.
- 0.119u1            : Improvements to the Z180 core [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]: Added the 2 Programmable Reload Timers. Fixed the Internal I/O Registers remapping. Added logical -> physical memory translation. Disabled loops hack. Removed "extra icount". Changed interrupts handling. Now they're checked as in Z80 core. Simplified RETN and EI opcodes. Fixed PRT interrupts. Cleared both interrupts flip flops when taking any irq. Added _IFF2 = _IFF1; just before _IFF1 = 0; when taking an NMI.
- 21st September 2007: Pierpaolo Prazzoli - After having fun with a simple decryption and with  a couple of fixes to the Z180 core, I could get a first screenshot from the game. But there's something else going wrong now, that causes the game code to crash. I don't know yet if it's another cpu core bug or protection... As a bonus, with those fixes to Z180 core I could get sound working in galaga game inside 20pacgal.
- 0.109u5            : Aaron Giles converted the z180 disassemblers to the new format and added step in/out support where it was obvious.
- 0.98u2             : Aaron Giles rewrote the Z80/Z180 daisy chaining logic to work a little closer to the hardware (added cpu\z80\z80daisy.c).
- 27th August    2004: Guru - As an update to the previous news, there seems to be another way we can get at the data in the HD647180 MCU. Not directly, but we can side-step around it with this device (http://www.advantech.com/products/Model_Detail.asp?model_id=1-KLY4E&PD=), which allows us to snoop on what any chip is sending to any other chip, and what it receives from any other chip. It can be used to monitor and capture any data travelling to/from it's Data and Address lines. Even a Logic Analyser is no good because to capture all the data we need would require a Logic Analyser with a HUGE amount of on-board RAM (typical Analysers have only 512k or less RAM on-board which would allow capturing only a fraction of a second of data). We can't get a direct dump of the internals (we'll never get that), but the captured data will allow us to develop an accurate HLE of the chip's end functions. I believe this is similar/identical to the device that is being used to break the Hitachi FD1094's used on many Sega boards. I would guess that it can be used to snoop on many other Microcontrollers too, I'm sure. So probably this is the next gizmo we will look at buying...
- 25th August    2004: Guru - I finally located the Teki Paki board and attempted to dump it's HD647180 (QFP80) using the recently-arrived adapter. Bad news unfortunately, it's protected. So there's is virtually no hope of ever seeing sound emulated in those Toaplan games that use this chip. Adding to this dilemma, I swapped the Vimana chip with the Teki Paki one and the board had no sounds at all, which tells me the contents of each chip per game is different. Of course, when I put the chip back onto the correct PCB, it works fine :) In other (bad) news, I've also attempted a dump of the HD647180 PLCC84 chip on Gaelco's Masterboy. This is also protected. This is the main CPU code, so the game will not run at all without it. Masterboy is a pretty crap game anyway, so no loss there.

- NOTES: The Z180 (HD647180) is a sound cpu with internal rom (32k). It uses a 8-bit microprocessor (DIP64), code compatible with the Zilog Z80. The Z180 family adds higher performance and integrated peripheral functions like clock generator, 16-bit counters/timers, interrupt controller, wait-state generators, serial ports and a DMA controller.[2] It uses separate read and write strobes, sharing similar timings with the Z80 and Intel processors.[3] The on-chip memory management unit (MMU) has the capability of addressing up to 1 MB of memory. It is possible to configure the Z180 to operate as the Hitachi HD64180.

8.7   FD1089

- 0.186              : Changed name 'FD1089A' to 'Hitachi FD1089A Encrypted CPU' and 'FD1089B' to 'Hitachi FD1089B Encrypted CPU'.
- 21st July      2014: Charles MacDonald - I've updated the FD1089 key management tool to support a brute-force LCG seed search function for the MC8123. This was used to produce a key for Sega's Center Court that was recently dumped and added to MAME. Some plaintext must be provided to carry out the search. It only took 8 bytes of data from Passing Shot to make a match, in this case the code for the NMI handler that sends ADPCM data to the uPD7759 was used as it was the least likely to be altered in Center Court. The tool supports searching for plaintext within a range of addresses so that matches can be made if the encrypted code or data is a different location than expected.
- 0.154              : Added complete dump of the FD1089B 317-0027 key to SDI - Strategic Defense Initiative [Charles MacDonald, ShouTime, The Dumping Union]. Document the newly redumped FD1089A 317-0027 along with it's unencrypted data range [Charles MacDonald].
- 0.153              : Updated FD1089 documentation [Charles MacDonald].
- 31st December  2013: Charles MacDonald - The FD1089 key tool has been updated with a faster and more accurate method for generating keys from raw table dumps. Now it supports non-standard key data, such as the kind extracted from a FD1089 with a dead battery. I also had a chance to rewrite the control software for the 68K analyzer board and optimize the dumping functions. It can extract a complete FD1089 table set in a few hours instead of several days.
- 0.149u1            : Minor doc update [Brian Troha].
- 0.147u3            : More OO & consistent in FD1089 [smf].
- 20th October   2012: Charles MacDonald - Here's the current version of the fdtool program (http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/zip/fdtool-102012.zip) which is used to work with and manipulate FD1089 tables and key data. It has a few modes of operation: * Search through a table set to find a LCG seed that can generate the tables. If the tables are damaged or incomplete it can usually still derive a likely candidate for the seed, it just won't confirm it as being correct. * Generate a key file from a LCG seed and list of encrypted code/data memory ranges. This is for building keys where we know the seed but haven't dumped it, so the encrypted code/data ranges have to be guessed. * Generate a table set from a key file, mainly for validating keys. * Turn a directory of old-format individual table files to a single file. I've been using it to make key data for the "wb35a" ROM set in MAME and a new Fantasy Zone (317-0016) set. The original keys were made by Chris Hardy and I'm converting them to the new key format. These should be added in the near future along with the redumped sjryuko 317-5021 key. The dumping hardware design files and control program will get released next. I'm using it to get a better idea of how the 68000 runs on a cycle by cycle basis, but the hardware needs some slight modifications to fully enable this type of clock control. Once that's done and tested it will be ready for the public.
- 13th October   2012: Charles MacDonald - The FD1089 work discussed earlier is nearly done. I finished a program that can search for LCG seeds and used it to generate a complete key for 'Sukeban Jansi Ryuko', to replace the partial key we had in MAME. Together with the dumping circuit any FD1089 can be preserved now. There's a lot of partial dumps in MAME so if you can help out and loan a FD1089 to be read out, please get in touch.
- 0.146u5            : Converted FD1089/FD1094 into proper devices, derived from M68000. They now handle their own decryption and memory management, so we can remove all the calls for initialization/reset/etc. The key now lives as a 'key' subdevice under the CPU, and the FD1089/1094 are now specified just like any other CPU [Aaron Giles].
- 17th August 2012   : Charles MacDonald - While FD1094 dumping has been a plug-and-play affair, we've never had a good solution for the FD1089. We recently acquired a FD1089-based game to be redumped to complete the partial table set that's already in MAME. This was a good opportunity to approach the FD1089 again from a new perspective, given the last work I had done on it was back in 2005. Here's the dumping circuit I developed (http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/img/fdtool.png). This is a variation of the custom Z80 dumping board I made for the Free Kick-type CPU modules. There's a lot more chips underneath the top PCB, and the empty sockets were for some alternate ideas that I ended up not needing to use. The new automated dumping process works like this: * Reset CPU 256 times and present each possible value for the low and high words of the PC vector, then force a bus error during the first instruction fetch. The decrypted PC is pushed to the stack and captured. This generates encryption tables for addresses 4,6 that can be used for 0,2 and 10 through 16, which is enough to encrypt our own PC, SP, and a short fragment of code. * Cycle the stack pointer through all addresses and execute the instruction "MOVE.L (A7), (A7)". This allows two adjacent data words to be decrypted and captured, so tables for the entire data space can be dumped. * Cycle the stack pointer through all addresses and execute "MOVE.L -$12(PC,A7.L), (A7)". This allows two adjacent program words to be decrypted and captured so the entire program space can be dumped. I used the FT2232 chip in MPSSE mode to control the I/O expanders which are SPI peripherals. Even at 10 MHz it's still a little slow, but since everything works automatically I don't mind letting it run in the background for a while. Being able to control the 68000 at the bus-cycle level makes a lot of interesting behavior readily apparent. You can see the prefetch mechanism, including dummy fetches that result in unused data, and the out-of-order stack writes during exceptions. Plus a lot of invalid instruction encodings don't cause exceptions at all, which isn't what I expected. Rather than being useful undocumented instructions I think they are just aliases for other valid ones. Anyway it would be worthwhile to look into this further.
- 0.127u1            : Atari Ace moved FD1089 decryption keys to external files.
- 0.126u5            : Nicola Salmoria updated the FD1089 decryption algorythm to use the real keys generated by the LCG as found by Andreas Naive. The algorithm is more complex than it should be, but I haven't been able to simplify it more. The keys are still embedded in the source. It would now be reasonable to move them to external files; however, for several games we only have partial keys so the files would need to be BAD_DUMP.
- 0.125u4            : Added machine\fd1089.h.
- 0.92u1             : FD1089 Update [Nicola Salmoria, Charles MacDonald]. Complete table for 317-0033 (Alien Syndrome) and 317-0034 (Super Hang-On).
- 0.90u4             : FD1089 update [Nicola Salmoria, Charles MacDonald]. Improved decryption logic. Added complete table for Enduro Racer and more data to Super Hang On Table.
- 0.90u1             : Added machine\fd1089.c. FD1089 decryption [Nicola Salmoria, Charles MacDonald]. 100% accurate emulation of FD1089A, FD1089B should be considered 99% because it will have to be verified with other CPUs (it is 100% for all currently supported games). Complete tables provided by Charles MacDonald for 317-0018 (Action Fighter), 317-0022 (Dunk Shot), 317-0168 (Aurail). Partial tables derived by comparison with the unencrypted versions for Enduro Racer, Alex Kidd, 317-0024 (Time Scanner), 317-0033 (Alien Syndrome, 3 versions), 317-0027 (SDI). (actual working cpus are needed to obtain full tables).
-  3rd January   2005: Aaron Giles - A bit sooner than I expected! Nicola submitted the first pass at the FD1089A/B decryption, and it's quite impressive. There are a number of new games this enables, including Action Fighter and Dunk Shot, as well as a number of alternate versions of Alien Syndrome, Alex Kidd, SDI, Time Scanner and Aurail. Luckily, as Charles guessed, Action Fighter seems to work fine on MAME, without the graphics issues he mentioned on his site. The game appears to be something of a Spy Hunter ripoff, letting you pilot various vehicles, chasing down bad guys. Dunk Shot needed some tweaking to get working, but it's fully playable now as well, including controls for all four players. All the new variants of existing games are hooked up now and their controls are working. Hopefully I'll get the chance to finish up the sprite consolidation in the next couple of days so that I can submit this giant updated mass of goodness!
- 11th December  2004: Charles MacDonald - Got Dunk Shot fixed, works fine now. The weird thing is that it's a System 16B game but the video hardware seems to be a little different. I developed a utility to encrypt a test program for direct use on the Dunk Shot FD1089A, and have confirmed that it cannot execute unencrypted code. So patching the original game code on a per-game basis to extract data seems to still be necessary, at least for the time being. This makes the process more difficult but certainly not impossible-
-  5th December  2004: Charles MacDonald - Here's Dunk Shot (System 16B, 317-0022) decrypted and running. Thanks to Dave Widel for donating the CPU, and ShinobiZ & COY for providing the original and bootleg Dunk Shot ROM sets. This is the first FD1089A game that has been decrypted. While it it's encryption method is less complex, finding the right place to insert your own decryption routine is extremely difficult. This is because all data as well as code is encrypted (no vector table changes, hard to know where code starts/stops) and there are no direct instructions, which was the most important finding that led to the FD1094 being figured out. As eight of every 16 bits are encrypted, you have a 50/50 chance of identifying code sequences, which improves as the size of the search data increases. A disappointing aspect of the FD1094 is that you cannot easily restore a non-working game. It's possible to manually put together an unencrypted ROM set from the original data and several decrypted program ROM images (one for each state used), but it is difficult to be 100% sure the result is correct and these kinds of hacks are frowned upon. Luckily this is not the case with the FD1089A. While opcodes and data are encrypted, there is no state mechanism so the decrypted data is just two copies of the program ROM image, one decrypted as code, and the other as data. You could write these to a larger ROM and have the 68000 FC0 pin drive the high order address line to select the decrypted opcodes or decrypted data portion. What remains to be seen is how difficult it is to decrypt other FD1089A based games. I was able to make progress with Dunk Shot because I had a bootleg set and could get an idea of the what the game code did, so it could be patched. For a game with no bootleg it's trickier since you can only make guesses about the game's program flow, what instructions are used at which addresses, etc.
-  3rd December  2004: Charles MacDonald - Progress on the FD1089A/B is on hold at the moment, as I'm waiting for more CPUs to run tests on. Not a problem, just need to determine what the common points are between games rather than what's specific to Dunk Shot.
- 12th November  2004: Charles MacDonald - I've been examining a board which appears to implement the FD1089A workings using regular TTL parts and some programmable logic. It's pretty old (1985) and finding information for some of the components has been difficult. If anyone can help out, I'm looking for information (datasheets, primarily pin assignments) for the following parts: Harwin M3-7643B-5 / Intersil M37643B, Harwin M3-7649-5 / Intersil M37649, Fujitsu MB7142E and Toshiba TMM24128AP (just a 128kx8 EPROM, need a pinout though). I'm also looking for dead or unwanted FD1089A or FD1089B CPUs from any game to run tests on.
- 29th October   2004: Charles MacDonald - I've been able to decrypt a large portion of the game "Dunk Shot" which uses a FD1089A. It turns out the program ROMs from the bootleg dump (used as a reference to locate code in the encrypted ROMs) weren't completely bad, the decrypted data and opcodes are stored separately and in unusual locations within each ROM. There should probably be more data (about 1/3 of the original content is accounted for) but it was more than enough to get started with. The FD1089A is fairly interesting: both code and data are encrypted, and a wider range of address bits seem to be used for the decryption (compare to FD1094 where the encryption 'wrapped' on 16K boundaries). Everything from the program space is encrypted identically, so using an instruction with a PC-relative EA mode allows you to read the PC/SP vectors, game code, interrupt handler code, etc. Thankfully no 'states' this time to deal with, as the FD1089A is very different from the FD1094. One problem with encrypted code and data is that it's harder to determine where sections of code start and end. Also there are no 'direct' opcodes so it isn't easy to program the FD1089A at all. An advantage with Dunk Shot (and possibly other games) is that only bits $FC48 of each word are encrypted, the remaining bits are unmodified. So you can search for a sequence of data and get fairly good matches, the longer the search data is the more accurate the results are. For example longer instructions like 'move.l #imm32, $mem.w' are easier to find, and from there the unencrypted bits of the opcode can be changed to modify the EA mode to something more desirable. There's plenty of work left to be done, but some initial progress has been made.
- NOTES: The FD1089 is a 68000 with built-in encryption. It contains some battery-backed RAM, when the battery dies the CPU stops working. Both opcodes and data are encrypted, using different (but related) mappings. Decryption works on 16-bit words, but only 8 bits are affected, the other 8 are left untouched. A special value in internal RAM disables the encryption, this is necessary otherwise RAM would not work as expected (writing data and reading it back would return a different number). The FD1089A and FD1089B work in the same way, but the decryption tables are different. The internal RAM contains the 8-bit key to use at every address (only 12 bits of the address are used, so the encryption repeats). The FD1089 design is clearly derived from the MC8123. The MC8123 is a Z80 so it made sense to encrypt all 8 data bits and use 12 of the 16 address bits. It makes a lot less sense to encrypt only half of the 16 data bits; using 12 of the 24 address bits might be ok, but not in the way it was done. The choice of address bits to use was probably dictated by the need to not encrypt data in certain areas of the address space, so they had to include the top 8 bits of the address. However this means that if you pick e.g. area 000000-00FFFF, where most of the program code resides, just 4 address bits affect the encryption, making it very weak when compared to the MC8123. Out of the 16KB of internal RAM, you need less than 128 bytes to decrypt a whole game - the rest is not used. A waste of space and security. Also, since only 8 of the 16 bits are encrypted, it is very easy to use the unencrypted ones to search for known sequences of code or data. Like for the MC8123, the contents of the internal RAM were generated using a linear congruential generator, so the whole key can be generated starting from a single 24-bit seed. Note however that the "don't decrypt" data sections need special treatment so it's not possible to derive the precise key without access to the CPU.

Refactored FD1094's decryption code in order to make the function more amenable to inversion. FD1094's documentation updates & cleanups [Andreas Naive].
- 31st December  2013: Charles MacDonald - I've added framework for analyzing 68K behavior at a bus cycle or clock cycle level, which I used to look into a quirk of the FD1094 with more detail. Back when the inital FD1094 research was being done I noticed the FC2-0 pins didn't seem to behave normally, but didn't have a way to examine this closely. These pins are used to indicate if a memory access is for program code or data. It turns out the FD1094 drives these low at all time (which is an undefined state) and only asserts them to indicate an interrupt acknowledge cycle. This makes it harder to track what the CPU is doing. It's not really a factor in terms of emulation or extracting table data, but it's an interesting security measure added to the hardware to make things challenging for bootleggers.
- 0.146u5            : Removed machine\s16fd.c. Converted FD1089/FD1094 into proper devices, derived from m68000. They now handle their own decryption and memory management, so we can remove all the calls for initialization/reset/etc. The key now lives as a 'key' subdevice under the CPU, and the FD1089/1094 are now specified just like any other CPU. Created a helper class for managing fd1094 decryption caches. Removed the horrible s16fd and s24fd files. Good riddance [Aaron Giles].
- 17th August 2012   : Charles MacDonald - Thanks to ShouTime we finally got Last Survivor dumped and emulated. It's a good reminder that there are still working FD1094 CPUs out there, and we do need to get them dumped as soon as possible. Between this and Bullet we have had good fortune finding rare games, so who knows, maybe we'll find Charon next.
- 0.128u7            : Added machine\fddebug.h.

- 29th March     2007: Aaron Giles - #1 With A...: I took a break from Excite League and decided to look at Bullet instead, mainly because it was a bigger unknown than a baseball game. After some more aggressive improvements to my analysis tools and many hours of tedium, I managed to get almost all of the code for the game successfully idenitified. Out of the 8192 key bytes, I'm down to less than 100 ambiguous cases, and have over 67% of the mystery bits in the key identified. With this work, I'm finally able to get the game up and running. It passes all tests, the attract mode runs, and the game is pretty playable, though I think there are a few minor glitches that still need to be worked out. Interestingly, it appears to be the only 3-player dual-joystick game I can think of. Haven't gotten far enough into the game to really get a feel for what it's like, but I will include the current partial key with the next MAME update so you can have a look yourself.
- 21st March     2007: Aaron Giles - FD1094 Analysis, part 3: Unfortunately, just knowing the pseudo-random number generation formula is only good enough to identify the low 6 bits in 8188 out of the 8192 bytes of the key. The top two bits aren't generated by the formula, and the first four bytes are completely independent. The first four bytes of the FD1094 key are what's known as the 'global' key. The first byte indicates which internal mode the FD1094 switches into whenever an interrupt is taken (the FD1094 has 256 different modes that it can be in, and programs can switch between them at will while running). The three bytes following affect how the bit permutations work across the entire key, which is why we generally refer to it as the 'global' key. In order to decrypt a given word of the program code, we take the 8-bit value from the key at the corresponding address, plus the 24 bits from the global key, plus the 8-bit current mode, and use those 40 bits to determine how to shuffle the bits to produce the final result. Fortunately, there are some patterns in the global key that help reduce the keyspace by a few bits (each bit that is 'locked' reduces the search space by a factor of 2, so each bit counts!), so in the end we only have to search all 8 bits of the first byte, and 16 bits over the next three bytes, so 24 bits total. Add that to the 22 bits necessary to fully describe a seed value for the random number generator, and we're up to 46 bits worth of 'root' key data necessary to generate all of the full 8192-byte key, minus the top two bits. So, what's in those top two bits of the rest of the key? Well, as I mentioned in part 1, bit $80 is set consistently at addresses from $0004-$0FFF, and bit $40 is set consistently at addresses from $1004-$1FFF. So actually, for most of the bytes, one of the two remaining bits is a constant value. It's that final bit that is the tricky part. One of the features of the FD1094 is that, after all the bit permutation has completed, certain decrypted values are thrown away and replaced by the value $FFFF. This was likely done either to prevent the use of certain opcodes, or (more likely) so that $FF fills-which are a common encryption weakness-could be encrypted in a random fashion. Regardless of the reasons, the final bit has a significant effect on this $FFFF replacement step. If the bit is 0, a certain subset of decrypted values are replaced; if the bit is 1, a more expansive set of decrypted values are replaced (including all of those that get replaced if the bit is 0). To simplify the following explanation, I'm going to break the decrypted values into 3 categories. Category A opcodes are never converted to $FFFF. Category B opcodes are always converted to $FFFF, regardless of the state of the mystery bit. And Category C opcodes are only coverted to $FFFF if the mystery bit is set to 1. Thus, at encryption time, the programmers had to be careful about what opcodes were present in the original code stream. Obviously opcodes in Category A were fine. However, opcodes in Category B are always converted to $FFFF, so they had to completely avoided; presumably there was some mechanism to avoid that problem. And for the opcodes in Category C, it had to be ensured that the mystery bit was set to 0 in the key. Now, there are several potential theories about how the mystery bit was generated for the key. One theory is that the bit comes from the random number generator, but is then modified to change the bit to 0 wherever there is an opcode from Category C in the path. Statistical analysis of all the existing keys disproves this theory: if it were true, then the mystery bit should be set to 0 consistently less than 50% of the time. In reality the mystery bit varies quite a bit; on some games it is 0 in 30% of the bytes, and on others it goes as high as 70%. A second theory is that by default the mystery bit is set to 1 everywhere except where there is an opcode from Category C. This would mean that the mystery bit is strictly determined by the original code. This theory seems more likely. A quick analysis of the simplest game (Sonic Boom) reveals that the mystery bit is only 0 if there is at least one Category C opcode present, and is 1 in all other cases. This is not definitive, but it is a good indication. So, how can we figure out what that last bit is? That's the trick, and the reason that I've been pounding away at creating some new debugger extensions. It involves a lot of tedious work, and I don't think we'll get 100% perfect results, but I'm hopeful we can get something playable at least. It essentially involves analyzing all possible decrypted combinations that you get when you decrypt the code with the mystery bit set and clear, discarding any invalid opcodes, and then manually selecting the right answer based on analysis of the code. Through this mechanism I've managed to get the title screen of Excite League to come up, and have identified over 30% of the mystery bits in Bullet.
- 0.113u3            : Added machine\fddebug.c. Aaron Giles added extensive (but still WIP) FD1094 debugging tools for help in brute force searching for keys.
- 21st March     2007: Aaron Giles - FD1094 Analysis, part 2: The next step in analyzing the FD1094 keys was to see if I couldn't replicate the pattern of the existing keys using a linear congruential generator (LCG). A LCG is typically written in the form: x' = (a * x + b) % c  which requires three constant parameters a, b and c to be determined. Assuming that this was done with 32-bit math, that would be 2^32 x 2^32 x 2^32 = 2^96 possible combinations. That's a bit much to brute-force examine. Fortunately, thanks to the fact that the bit sequences repeat at even powers of two, we can eliminate c from the equation entirely, since it is just a mask. Furthermore, a property of LCGs with even power of 2 values for c is that bit n repeats with a frequency of 2^n. Beyond these two factors, if you think about it, bits in x that sit higher than the one we are interested in don't really matter. For example, if we are interested in bit 8, and a is $7F and b is $42, then we will get the same bit sequence in bit 8 as we would if a were $F87F and b were $10442 (you may need to do the math to convince yourself - I did). Thus, only the bits below bit 8 matter when searching for a and b. Given these additional constraints, our search space got significantaly smaller. Taking, for example, a bit that repeats with a frequency of 8192 (2^13), we need only look at 2^13 values for a and 2^13 values for b, or 2^26 total possibilities. Not bad at all. Of course, for each a/b combination, we had to generate the sequence of 2^13 bits in order to compare against our existing data. After doing some searching across all the keys, eventually I found that a consistent value for a worked to generate the low six bits of all the keys, when combined with an initial seed value, one of 5 different initial values for b, and one of 6 different shift amounts (i.e., compute x', then shift right by a given amount, and mask against $3F to get the low six bits). It turned out that every single one of the existing FD1094 keys could have its low six bits generated in this fashion, and through this mechanism, I was able to fix single-bit errors in several keys. At last, the analysis was starting to pay off! Nicola noticed something odd about the values for a and b, and further reduced the equation to: t = a * x and x' = t + (t << 16). The nice thing about this equation is that it gets rid of the arbitrary shift and b values entirely, leaving only an initial seed value which is unique for each game. So, with the mystery of the low 6 bits solved, and one of the two remaining bits fixed across most of the key, all that is left is to figure out what the final bit is for each of the 8192 bytes of the key. Unfortunately, it turns out that this bit does not appear to be algorithmically generated. More on that in part 3.

- 19th March     2007: Aaron Giles - FD1094 Analysis, part 1: As you might have noticed, there has been some good recent progress on emulating the remaining encrypted Sega games, even though we don't have the CPUs available for analysis. This has stemmed from some analysis of the keys used in the games. For the MC8123-based games, Nicola has taken the analysis to its final conclusion and successfully generated full keys. Unfortunately for the FD1094, it's not quite that simple, but progress is being made, and I'm still hopeful the game code can be decoded. Now, I'm no encryption expert (as I've said many times before), but for a while now I've had the sneaking suspicion that that keys stored in the FD1094 CPUs used by Sega were too large to be anything other than algorithmically generated. About a month ago, I posted the idea to the MAME developer list, asking if anyone else thought this might be an avenue worth pursuing, but didn't get much of a response. So I decided to start an analysis of the FD1094 keys that we currently have. I started by looking for obvious patterns. There are a couple of interesting ones. Namely: Bytes in the key at addresses $0004-0FFF all have bit $80 set. Bytes in the key at addresses $1004-1FFF all have bit $40 set. And Bits 0-5 of each key are very uniformly random (almost exactly 50/50 0's versus 1's). Armed with this knowledge, I decided to start looking for repetitions in each of the low 6 bits of all the keys we had. The theory I was going under is that some sort of pseudo-random number generator was responsible for producing these bits. At the time these devices were created, there was not a big focus on cryptographically secure random number generation, so I was hoping they used some kind of simple linear congruential generator (LCG - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator). If they did, then eventually any sequence they generated would repeat. My initial theory was that there was one generator, and that by stringing together bits from different keys, we might be able to reconstruct the algorithm that generated them. So I wrote a program that read in all the keys and looked for sequences where the ending set of values from one key overlapped the starting set of values from another key, taking each bit independently. Sure enough, it didn't take long to discover that there were what looked to be several long sequences of bits, some of which repeated at regular intervals. The interesting thing here is that the bit sequences I was finding repeated at even power of 2 intervals, which initially made me think that perhaps the algorithm for generating the keys was more of a bit permutation than an LCG, but OG helpfully pointed out that an LCG with a modulus of an even power of 2 will repeat its bits at an even power of 2 frequency. Even more interesting was the discovery that in the cases where bit 0 of a key had a period of 2^n, bit 1 would have a period of 2^n+1, bit 2 would have a period of 2^n+2, etc. This indicated that it was quite likely the case that the low 6 bits were generated all at once with a single LCG. This was even better news than I had hoped. The next step, then, was to figure out what the parameters of the LCG were. I'll talk about that in part 2.

-  2nd January   2006: Charles MacDonald - I converted a dead System 18 AliFD1094-based game (Alien Storm) to use a decrypted ROM set. It works perfectly, and can be done with a ROM replacement and a simple circuit that goes between the 68000 and program ROMs.

Emulation of Sega FD1094 encrypted 68k CPUs [Charles MacDonald - extracting data from CPUs, Nicola Salmoria - decryption code]. This will allow for significant progress in the emulation of the remaining encrypted Sega games. Note that we require working CPUs to extract encryption data from in order to emulate the encrypted titles, see http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/ for more details. As a result of this code several of the encrypted games will now boot (astorm, ddcrew, wb3a, wb3b, tetris, ddux, sonicbom etc.).
- 21st October   2004: Charles MacDonald - Should be a lot of FD1094's coming in the next week or two, that will make up for the lack of updates. I've still been doing plenty of tests with the FD1094 and dumping table data in the meantime, which is useful but not exactly worth discussing. I ran some tests on the System 24 hardware to see how CPU performance is affected when one CPU accesses memory or a device on the other one's bus.
- 0.87u4             : Added machine\fd1094\317-0092.c. Nicola Salmoria added code to decrypt FD1094 CPU 317-0092 in states 0x00-0xff (0x00 is reset, 0x10 is IRQ) this is the CPU used by tetris, code is not hooked up yet.
- 25th September 2004: Charles MacDonald - I wrote a new, reasonably fast version of the table dumping software. It works entirely using direct opcodes with no reliance on encrypted data, so you can start dumping tables from any FD1094 without modifying the software. It also only resets the FD1094 once and doesn't rely on double exceptions to halt it, as it's been theorized that resets or other unusual behavior may cause additional drain on the battery, possibly as a tamper-proofing feature. A 16K block is provided for any state initialization (compare instructions or to enter an interrupt) so data from any state can be retrieved. It's been optimized as much as I can and the time it takes to dump tables is fixed regardless of the amount of state setup code. I will be releasing a software package with documentation for how to build the Sega board <> PC link, which I have simplified into a USB-based two chip design. It's easy to make, cheap and all you need is a device programmer to burn some EPROMs and a PLD. I'll be including the decryption programs and other code for System 24 software development. When I have the time, I'd like to write some example programs for System 16/18/C2/Mega Play as well, to go along with the System 24 stuff.
- 18th September 2004: Charles MacDonald - Great news, I've been able to sucessfully decrypt any 16K block from D.D. Crew. It should be possible to decrypt the entire game at this point. Because D.D. Crew is so large, I'm going to work on Tetris first. The argument to the compare instruction has an effect the decryption state for all following data. Most of it's 32 bits do something, though there are plenty of settings that give the same decrypted output. All you have to do is make the FD1094 execute compare instructions as they come up in the code, and the rest of the data can be decrypted. From what I've seen the result is not cumulative, so just need to run the last compare instruction instead of all prior ones. The catch is that because the decryption state can be changed by the programmer at almost any point in the game's code, you have to trace through the code which is a tedious process. D.D. Crew changes the state a lot but only uses the same few arguments, so one solution would be to decrypt the entire ROM multiple times with different compares being used, and then patch together the correct parts. Tetris only changes the state four times in the startup code and doesn't do anything afterwards, making it a better choice to work with. What's really exciting is, assuming no other problems arise, the technique I'm using is applicable to any FD1094 module. There is no restriction on the source ROM size or the memory map (none of the original code is executed except for the compares). The only work that needs to be done for each game is to get the initial PC (which can be automated) and determine which instruction changes the decryption state, but from what I've seen in other bootlegs it's always the same one.
-  6th September 2004: Charles MacDonald - I've been getting some good tips and ideas from people. I modified the way data is captured using a shorter 'move.w #$imm, d0' instruction so data can be decrypted without needing tables for two adjacent words. Then a TRAP instruction can be placed after the test code to jump to a code fragment that stores D0 to memory. Currently the decrypting code works fairly well, and it takes about 5 minutes to get all the data from a single location. This is mainly because resetting the CPU makes it go through it's startup code each time before the first TRAP can be taken to the test code. This allows data following the first decrypted location to be decrypted too, I've done about 8 sequential positions now. At some point I'll come up against the code fragments used to do the test write and result store, but I can relocate those in the earlier decrypted range of data. The real problem is time and storage; for the first issue I can try to automate the PC-hosted program to dump data, look up the opcode from the resulting table, and proceed with the next word. The table data should amount to 1GB (table size is 128k, 8k positions to test) which is too much for me to put at my website for interested parties. :) Because the area being decrypted starts later in the ROM, you'd think the earlier data would be unrecoverable. But since the decryption wraps on 16K boundaries, I can just decrypt the first few hundred bytes of the next 16K to get the tables needed to decrypt the earlier parts. In theory, of course, as this is based on current assumptions. Stability is an issue because the FD1094 thinks it's in a System 16 environment and tries to do things that don't agree with the System 24 hardware when booting up. This can cause lock-ups, which would interrupt the process if it could be automated. On another subject, does anybody have a scan of the PCB for a Mega Play cartridge? I should be getting a Mega Play PCB soon but have no carts, and want to see what kind of differences there are between Mega Play and Genesis cartridges.
-  5th September 2004: Charles MacDonald - While comparing the Tetris data dumps, there appear to be a very specific group of values that are never generated as a result of the decryption function. These are all opcodes that access data with the PC relative addressing mode. Instructions like LEA and PEA aren't present because they only use the program counter to generate an effective address. The operands are all set to zero, since their value doesn't actually matter. It's interesting that these specific ones are omitted, in fact I haven't seen any bootlegs or unencrypted originals that have encrypted counterparts which use these types of instructions. I think the FD1094 designers prevented their use to get around having an 'easy' way to access memory in the supervisor program space. A smart move for them, but bad news for us. :) A majority of the values decrypted by the CPU have a unique output. The Tetris data shows that for the ones that don't, they nearly always map to $FFFF, $4E73, $0612, and $0404, and to a much lesser degree the values are in the 4xxx-6xxx range. It makes you wonder how (for example) an immediate operand can have all 64k possible values represented if the decrypted output has a smaller range than that. I guess I'll keep working with Tetris, for the life of me I cannot get E-Swat to behave. The bootleg code is too out of sync with the original to get an idea of what's going on. I also have a CPU for D.D. Crew but I believe that game has no bootleg for a reference. It may be possible to get tables of data from a few more locations in Tetris, but I don't think I'll bother with that unless somebody makes a request.
-  4th September 2004: Charles MacDonald - With the PC link working on my System 24 board, I have been doing tests on the Hitachi FD1094 CPU that Tetris uses (the 317-0092) because there is a very similar bootleg to it. I can also try E-Swat, but those are the only CPU modules I own that also have bootlegs. Tetris has the following instruction: 00005D0: 6945 BD0B 535B     move.w #$1111, $E0F6.w - My goal was to modify the immediate word operand and capture the decrypted value written to $FFE0F6. I modified the Tetris code to take a TRAP exception to this location, then added a RTE after it. Later in the game's code, a marker is written to RAM which is used to check when the write has occured. The other CPU can monitor this location and change the operand in a loop. Here is a table of the decrypted data: Update: I've added data from several other addresses too. This gives a better example of which values are position-independant and which ones change based on their address. Also I byteswapped all the files to be LSB first. (the other one wasn't, oops) tetris-data2.zip (1.3MB) - The 5d2.tbl table above has all 64k values of the word at address $0005D2. The results are fascinating, for example many values like 0E71 are decrypted as 4E71, which was the correlation I discussed earlier between the 4xxx group of opcodes. Even more interesting, the decrypted data has a lot of duplicate results, such as many values being decrypted as $FFFF. I had assumed every input would have a unique output. Remember that the decryption hardware also takes the current address into account, so some of the values would be different for another address, except for the 'fixed' results like the 4xxx group. Anyway, while it's not much, it's a first step to understanding how the FD1094 works. If anybody has some ideas for me to try, or notices anything interesting in the data, please let me know. I'll try to get some tables of data from other locations, though there are other experiments I want to run first. Update: One other point of interest: I tried relocating code fragments at different offsets and it turns out only bits 13-0 of the address are used when decrypting. Bits 23-14 are unused. So you can position the code at any 16K boundary and it will be decrypted in the same way. This means the 5d2.tbl file of decrypted data can be used in other locations. For example, in Tetris again: 00045D2: 799D CE7F BF3F     cmpi.b #$1E ($51, a6) - The decrypted value of $799D from the table is $0C2E. And in the bootleg version: 00045D2: 0C2E 001E 0051     cmpi.b #$1E ($51, a6) - There you have it, a perfect match. Tetris is pretty small so I can't give any more examples, but I think this shows the idea.
-  2nd September 2004: Charles MacDonald - I finished the prototype of a PC communications card that fits into the 30-pin expansion connector found on many Sega arcade boards. The transfer rate is about 180K per second in either direction, which is perfectly adequate -- most of the boards I own have less than 64k of RAM for program storage anyway. The limiting factor is the how fast the 68000 (10 MHz in this case) can process data. One experiment I tried was to have my System 16 emulator upload the video RAM contents to a Shinobi board during gameplay. There is quite a lot of flicker from the color and sprite RAM writes, and it doesn't run at full speed, but was nevertheless cool to watch. I think a better application in an emulator would be to have a hotkey that uploads the video state to the target hardware when pressed, so you can compare the software rendered display to what the real one should look like. Now that the communication code is working fairly well on both ends, I'll see about adapting it to the System 18/24/C2 platforms. In theory, this will conveniently solve the problem of ROM swapping on the System 24 board (no more bent pins!) so I can get back to playing around with the FD1094 and disk controller again. I've been running low on working flash memory chips and didn't want to risk wasting any more. Apart from just loading programs, the other nice aspect is that large amounts of data can be saved to disk instead of printed on the screen. This will be handy for testing the math chips that E-Swat uses.
- 23rd June      2004: Charles MacDonald - I've found out something really interesting about the Hitachi FD1094 instruction encoding. In comparing the bootleg or unencrypted original versions of several games to their encrypted counterparts, I noticed a group of instructions have a similar encoding to the original 68000 opcodes, that are always encoded in the same way regardless of position. The operands are encrypted, however. Normally instructions are encrypted based on their value and their address, so for example two ADDX.W instructions in sequence would have two very different opcodes. But in this case, a stream of identical opcodes have the same value. The group seems to be most of the 68000 $4xxx ones, most notably LEA is absent. In the FD1094 they are replaced as $0xxx.
- NOTES: The FD1094 is a custom CPU based on the 68000, which runs encrypted code. The decryption key is stored in 8kB of battery-backed RAM; when the battery dies, the CPU can no longer decrypt the program code and the game stops working (though the CPU itself still works - it just uses a wrong decryption key). Being a 68000, the encryption works on 16-bit words. Only words fetched from program space are decrypted; words fetched from data space are not affected. The decryption can logically be split in two parts. The first part consists of a series of conditional XORs and bitswaps, controlled by the decryption key, which will be described in the next paragraph. The second part does a couple more XORs which don't depend on the key, followed by the replacement of several values with FFFF. This last step is done to prevent usage of any PC-relative opcode, which would easily allow an intruder to dump decrypted values from program space. The FFFF replacement may affect either ~300 values or ~5000, depending on the decryption key. The main part of the decryption can itself be subdivided in four consecutive steps. The first one is executed only if bit 15 of the encrypted value is 1; the second one only if bit 14 of the _current_ value is 1; the third one only if bit 13 of the current value is 1; the fourth one is always executed. The first three steps consist of a few conditional XORs and a final conditional bitswap; the fourth one consists of a fixed XOR and a few conditional bitswaps. There is, however, a special case: if bits 15, 14 and 13 of the encrypted value are all 0, none of the above steps are executed, replaced by a single fixed bitswap. In the end, the decryption of a value at a given address is controlled by 32 boolean variables; 8 of them change at every address (repeating after 0x2000 words), and constitute the main key which is stored in the battery-backed RAM; the other 24 don't change with the address, and depend solely on bytes 1, 2, and 3 of the battery-backed RAM, modified by the "state" which the CPU is in. The CPU can be in one of 256 possible states. The 8 bits of the state modify the 24 bits of the global key in a fixed way, which isn't affected by the battery-backed RAM. On reset, the CPU goes in state 0x00. The state can then be modified by the program, executing the instruction CMPI.L #$00xxFFFF, D0 where xx is the state. When an interrupt happens, the CPU enters "irq mode", forcing a specific state, which is stored in byte 0 of the battery-backed RAM. Irq mode can also be selected by the program with the instruction CMPI.L #$0200FFFF, D0. When RTE is executed, the CPU leaves irq mode, restoring the previous state. This can also be done by the program with the instruction CMPI.L #$0300FFFF, D0. Since bytes 0-3 of the battery-backed RAM are used to store the irq state and the global key, they have a double use: this one, and the normal 8-bit key that changes at every address. To prevent that double use, the CPU fetches the 8-bit key from a different place when decrypting words 0-3, but this only happens after wrapping around at least once; when decrypting the first four words of memory, which correspond the initial SP and initial PC vectors, the 8-bit key is taken from bytes 0-3 of RAM. Instead, when fetching the vectors, the global key is handled differently, to prevent double use of those bytes. But this special handling of the global key doesn't apply to normal operations: reading words 1-3 from program space results in bytes 1-3 of RAM being used both for the 8-bit key and for the 24-bit global key.

- 0.151              : Show effective address in disassembly of PC-relative instructions (cpu\sh2\sh2dasm.c) [R. Belmont, based on a patch by Darksoft].
- 0.150              : Changed name 'SH-2' to 'SH-2 DRC'. Made both DRC and Non-DRC compile for MIPS, RSP and SH2 core and added option to enable/disable DRC from command line (-drc -nodrc by default it's on). Added command line option to force DRC C backend (emu\emuopts.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.149u1            : SH-2 CPU core timing changes [notaz]: JMP should be 2 cycles, according to the manual. OR #imm,R0 should be 1 cycle and OR #imm,@(R0,GBR) should be 3 to match the manual and other ops.
- 0.148u3            : Fixed labelnum usage in SLEEP. Also removed a useless branch equivalent to: if(sleep!=1) { sleep=1; } (cpu\sh2\sh2drc.c) [hap].
- 0.148u2            : Fixed SH-2 compilation without USE_SH2DRC [Oliver Stöneberg]. Fixed SH-2 DMAC irqs, fixes at least hard-locking on Baroque (cpu\sh2\sh2comn.c and sh2drc.c). SH-2 watchdog i/f is quite exotic, implement it so it can be debugged properly. Fixed SLEEP opcode in non-DRC SH-2. Fixed endianness (sh2\sh2drc.c) [Angelo Salese].
- 0.148u1            : Some notes on SH-2 Cache functionality (cpu\sh2\sh2comn.c). Fixed SH-2 non-DRC compile. Added illegal opcode handling for SH-2 CPU (added illegal opcode exception handling, side effect of some Saturn games on loading like Feda or Falcom Classics Vol. 1 (i.e. Master CPU Incautiously transfers memory from CD to work RAM H, and wipes out Slave CPU program code too while at it)). Illegal opcode is the start of the undefined address [Angelo Salese]. Fixed cpu\sh2\sh2drc.c [R. Belmont].
- 0.143u3            : R. Belmont fixed SH2 fractional FRC increments.
- 0.139u4            : Implemented support for SH-2 cycle steal mode, used by Fever Soccer [David Haywood]. R. Belmont fixed a SH-2 with TSTM opcode. Fixed BSRF and JSR in SH2DRC so delay slot insns can trash the calculated PR if they want. Fixed PC relative MOV in SH2 delay slot. Further improvements to PC_relative loads in the delay slot.
- 0.139u2            : Phil Bennett added missing save-state registration entries to the SH-2 core.
- 0.138u4            : Atari Ace fixed SH-2 interpreter.
- 0.129u6            : Aaron Giles moved SH2 set info functions to direct calls.

- 0.128u6            : Pointer-ified the SH2 CPU core [Aaron Giles].
- 0.128u5            : Aaron Giles fixed subtle timing calculation problems that affected SH-2 timers.
- 0.128u4            : Aaron Giles removed cpu_num info from SH2 in favor of just keeping the device object.
- 0.127u8            : R. Belmont fixed SH2 DRC's handling of internally generated IRQs, and fixed compiling in interpreter mode.
- 0.127              : SH-2 DRC updates [R. Belmont]: Moved IRQ handling front-end into recompiled code. Added TSTM/ANDM/XORM instructions. Oliver Stoenberg removed more unprintable characters in SH-2 disassembler.
- 0.126u3            : SH2DRC [R. Belmont, based on an idea by Mariusz Wojcieszek]: Add PC-relative load optimization and ability to disable if necessary. SH2DRC [R. Belmont, Aaron Giles]: Add SUBV, replace ADDV with C version as a precaution. (Fixes most of Bug #2026, except the part which is a separate bug). Added new implementation which uses flags directly, keeping the C versions in reserve in case they are needed. Aaron Giles simplified SH2 DRC shift/rotate instruction implementations. Oliver Stoenberg removed of unprintable chars (newlines) in SH-2 disassembler.
- 0.126u2            : R. Belmont fixed logging for the SH-2 has been left on.
- 0.126u1            : Added cpu\sh2\sh2drc.c and sh2fe.c. UDRC-based SH-2 dynamic recompiler [R. Belmont]: All games on all drivers should work as before except "colmns97" and "stress" which crash due to sound system trouble. All idle skips are still included. They are quite a bit less effective than they were on the interpreter, but they still give a boost. Fast RAM bypass is not included yet so this does not represent final performance. That said, it's consistently faster than the interpreter even now. Example: sfiii3 on 0.126 gets 609% on the interpreter and 961% on the DRC.
- 13th July      2008: R. Belmont - The initial version of the SH-2 UDRC frontend has been submitted. It's missing the *direct RAM* feature that will make it much faster, but performance is already promising. For example, a -nosound -nothrottle -str 120 run on sfiii3 gets 609% on stock 0.126 and 961% with the DRC. The results are less flashy on more intense games like diehard (230% on 0.126, 278% on the DRC), but there's still a consistent gain over the interpreter and hopefully more to come.
-  3rd July      2008: R. Belmont - The SH-2 DRC successfully got Cyvern past the on-screen POST last night, but that revealed a problem with cycle counting that was making MAME timing and interrupts work poorly at best. I fixed that, but there's now a bug where it crashes trying to resume after handling an interrupt. Never a shortage of fun with this stuff!
- 0.125u9            : Added cpu\sh2\sh2comn.c/h. SH2 core [R. Belmont]: Refactored to separate out things that aren't part of the interpreter. Converted context struct to go through a pointer.
-  2nd July      2008: R. Belmont - I've been working on a MAME UDRC frontend for the SH-2 for just under a week now. Last night it finally made it all the way through the suprnova BIOS and into the Cyvern boot code without errors (including handling interrupts). There are still several instructions left to implement before it actually shows something, but so far so good so what, right? This will speed up ST-V (and Saturn in MESS), Kaneko SuperNova, Psikyo SH-2, and CPS3. And SH-2 is a pure subset of SH-4 (aside from different boot vector semantics) so once done this frontend will make a fine starting point for an SH-4 UDRC.
- 0.109u5            : Aaron Giles converted the sh2 disassemblers to the new format and added step in/out support where it was obvious.
- 0.102u4            : Mariusz Wojcieszek introduced cpu_readop16() for opcode fetching.
- 0.99u3             : Mariusz Wojcieszek fixed 64 bit / 32 bit division in division unit and added callback called when cpu reads FTCSR register (intended for idle loop skipping for slave SH-2 CPU in ST-V).
- 0.89u5             : SH-2 bounds overflow fix [Mame32Plus].
- 0.79               : Fixed a problem with the SH2 speedup previously added [Olivier Galibert].
- 0.78u4             : Some slight SH-2 speedups [Carlos Santillan].
- 16th October   2003: David Haywood fixed a DMA problem in the SH-2 CPU core that caused broken tile graphics in Shienryu, so Shienryu is now mostly playable although some sprite colors are off.
- 15th October   2003: Olivier Galibert fixed some bugs in the SH-2 DMA thanks to information from sthief.
- 0.75u1             : Cleaned up SH-2 core a bit and added a possible kludge for Sol Divide's Music [Olivier Galibert].
- 12th October   2003: Olivier Galibert and Aaron Giles fixed more bugs in the timer system and SH-2 CPU core.
- 0.74u1             : Various SH2 fixes improving master/slave support, this improves Shienryu on ST-V but its not yet playable due to incomplete ST-V emulation) [Olivier Galibert].
- 15th September 2003: Olivier Galibert sent in fixes to the SH2 CPU core to make it work in a dual setup, and he fixed the DMA1 interrupt vector in it.
- 26th April     2003: Sthief fixed a bug in the CMPSTR instruction in the SH-2 CPU core.
-  3rd February  2003: Sthief fixed a small bug in the SH-2 CPU core but it does not seem to affect any games.
- 0.62               : Implementation of the SH7604 internal timers, giving sound to Sol Divide and the Super Kaneko Nova System games [R. Belmont].
- 22nd October   2002: Olivier Galibert updated the SH-2 CPU core with some cleanups and added mirror addresses to the division box.
- 20th October   2002: Olivier Galibert fixed a few things in the SH-2 CPU core.
- 15th September 2002: R. Belmont fixed the SH7604 internal timers so that the music in the Super Kaneko Nova System games is fixed and the controls work in the Taisen Hot Gimmick games.
- 14th September 2002: R. Belmont implemented the SH7604 internal timers which gets music and sound running in the rest of the Super Kaneko Nova System games, but the music still suddenly stops working after a while in the games. It also added sound to Sol Divide and gets the Taisen Hot Gimmick games working.
- 13th September 2002: Spice fixed a SH-2 CPU core bug which caused the freezing boss in Strikers 1945 II.
- 27th July      2002: Olivier Galibert fixed NMIs in the SH-2 CPU core.

-  1st March     2002: R. Belmont fixed a bug in the SH-2 CPU core which fixes the missing background graphics in Strikers 1945 II, although they still aren't perfect due to other unemulated features.
- 24th February  2002: Olivier Galibert fixed a bug that caused SH-2 registers fail to appear in the debug mode.
- 21st February  2002: David Haywood reported some progress in emulating Hitachi SH-2 based Psikyo games. Strikers 1945 II and Space Bomber are playable, although they miss a lot of graphics, have some wrong colors and no sound. S. Glaize reported progress on Super Kaneko Nova System which also uses the Hitachi SH-2 CPU. Gal's Panic S and Gal's Panic 4 work up to the title screen, Panic Street, Cyvern, Jan Jan Paradise, Sen-know and Tel Jan work up to the actual gameplay but crash after a while, and Puzz Loop isn't playable although the attract mode shows something.
- 0.37b14            : Removed cpu\sh2\sh2.c and sh2dasm.c.
-  7th February  2001: Sylvain Glaize fixed some bugs in the SH-2 CPU core.
- 0.37b10            : Added cpu\sh2\sh2.c, sh2.h and sah2dasm.c.
-  ???           2000: Juergen Buchmueller added the SH-2 CPU core.

- 0.141u1            : Cleanup and better SH4 common/interpreter separation. Port preliminary SH3 support from DRC [R. Belmont].
- 19th August    2009: R. Belmont - I'm making good progress on a dynamic recompiler for the SH-3 and SH-4 CPUs (NAOMI/Atomiswave/Dreamcast and friends, and eventually some of the later Cave games like Ibara). It helps that these processors are back compatible to the SH-2 which I previously wrote a DRC for, so that previous work serves as a well-tested base on which to add support for the newer features of the newer processors. With only 1 new instruction added the new DRC already can run the entire Atomiswave BIOS and start executing the actual cartridge (that BIOS is very minimal - it's roughly 4k of total code). No, I don't know how much the speed will improve, and there's plenty of work to go yet.
- 10th May 2009      : R. Belmont - A little more work on the SH-4 DRC (the front end "pre-scanner" is basically completed now, so it's almost time to start adding the new SH-3 and SH-4 opcodes to the actual codegen).

- 0.131u2            : Angelo Salese added a work-around for the UART FIFO read only status register on the SH-4 to make Tetris Kiwamemichi happy to boot. It crashes shortly after that like La Keyboard though (jumps to an unmapped address).
- 10th May 2009      : R. Belmont - A little more work on the SH-4 DRC (the front end "pre-scanner" is basically completed now, so it's almost time to start adding the new SH-3 and SH-4 opcodes to the actual codegen).
- 0.130u3            : ElSemi and Angelo Salese added direct mode JVS command, used by the I/O for the later NAOMI games.
- 0.128u6            : Pointer-ified the SH4 CPU core [Aaron Giles].
- 0.127u1            : SH4, NAOMI and Hikaru updates [Samuele Zannoli]: Fixed SH-4 core to support multiple SH-4s. Fixed LDCSR instruction. Fixed SH-4 I/O ports. Skeleton Hikaru driver with memory maps and both SH-4s. Fixed JVS/Maple translation so NAOMI 2 BIOS runs.

- 0.123u4            : R. Belmont fixed SH4 refresh ticks value of 0, makes awbios not blow up the timer system.
- 0.123u2            : Samuele Zannoli added missing SH4 instructions and bugfixed the FPU. Improved NAOMI I/O board emulation and added working controls.
- 0.122u2            : Samuele Zannoli added initial FPU support to the SH4 core.
- 0.120u3            : Samuele Zannoli corrected some errors in the SH4 core and implemented store queues and the basics of DMA. Added a call to simulate DMA transfers with external devices.
- 0.117u2            : More SH-4 core improvements [Samuele Zannoli]: Fixes some problems in the disassembly and instruction execution from the previous patch. Adds interrupt management. Implements register bank switching. Adds RTC timer counters. Adds memory refresh timer. Adds three timers of the TMU. Adds a configuration structure that specifies the processor mode pin settings. Internal processor clock frequencies calculated from mode pins and cpu clock. Systems using the sh4 processor secify its configuration structure.
- 0.116u1            : Added cpu\sh4\sh4regs.h. SH4 CPU core improvements [Samuele Zannoli]. Corrected opcode decoding and decodes all opcodes of SH4. Corrected disassembly and added support for all instruction of SH4 not in SH2. Now disassembles all fpu instructions. Changed cpu to little-endian (SH4 can be either big or little). Corrected which data is read and written from memory. Added registers fpul and dbr. Added (non-fpu) instructions of SH4 non present in SH2. Added four fpu instructions. Modified memory-mapped internal register management so that all internal registers can be actually used. Added file sh4regs.h with defines for all sh7750 internal registers.

9.2   uPD7725 / uPD96050

- 0.184              : Fixed uPD7725 disassembly [smf]. Added Air Rescue's uPD7725 DSP and load its roms. Disabled for now, since the uPD7725 CPU core will need some features added before this can work. Added preliminary IRQ support. Handle the LSB-first load from SI properly, for when SI gets hooked up in the future. Added siack and soack registers and their requisite jumps, not used yet. Fixed missing si register and flags registers savestate registration. Fixed an off-by-one error when loading uPD96050 roms for SNES games (bus\snes\upd.cpp). Fixed LSB-first bit ordering for SO reg, not used yet. Use accessors to access the SR p0 and p1 bits, rather than masking. Corrected which registers are actually reset by /RESET and fixed/updated IRQ system, should behave more properly now [Lord Nightmare].

- 0.141u1            : Added cpu\upd7725\upd7725.c/h and dasm7725.c. Added uPD7725 16-bit DSP core and hookups for SNES hardware [BYUU, R. Belmont]. NEC DSP updates [R. Belmont, BYUU, Dr. Decapitator]: Now supports uPD96050. Hooked up SNES common code to use uPD96050 for ST-010/011. Removed ST-010 HLE simulation.
-  2nd January   2011: R. Belmont - Dr. Decapitator recently read out the internal ROMs for the Super NES "DSP-1", "DSP-2", "DSP-3" and "DSP-4" chips. These are all fairly low-powered NEC uPD7725 16-bit DSPs used to offload 3D trig calculations in games like Pilotwings and Super Mario Kart. BYUU wrote an emulation core for this chip for bsnes and kindly donated it to MAME/MESS so now SNES in MESS has perfect math on games using the DSP as well. And the great thing is the previous HLE simulation code used for these games was larger than both the 7725 core and the ROMs. So you save a little compile time and memory and get guaranteed perfect results. I love it!

9.44  uPD7810

- 0.188              : Created C-Chip device with correct CPU type in it and a bunch of notes (pinout etc.). Use internal ROM map for other uPD78C10 chips as it's always present [David Haywood].
- 0.183              : Replaced fake I/O space with callbacks. Preparing for future use [AJR].
- 0.180              : Changed the uPD7810 disassembler to use 'std::ostream &' internally [Nathan Woods].
- 0.156              : Fixed ADC output register range. ADC functions should return bytes. Sample and hold ADC value at start of conversion process. Clear sample and hold on ADC reset. Removed removed code duplication in timers 0 and 1 and in ETIMER. Set ETIMER interrupts. Removed gamemaster hack for INTFE1. The extended timer has been properly implemented in upd7810. Tested with (MESS) Continental Galaxy 2020. Treat NMI like other interrupts. Correctly deal with external interrupts. Return meaningful value when PC3 is in control mode. When PC3 is in control mode, it acts as INT2 and external Timer Input. INT2 may be set by connected devices through set_input_line(), so its value can be used when reading or writing to PC3. There is currently no code to support external timer input. Fixed bug introduced in extended timer simplification. ECNT clear control happens after capture control. ixed, export and improved timer/event counter output. The timer/event counter outputs (CO0 and CO1) are set differently when EOM changes and when a timer update occurs. Most EOM values are cleared on use. The document at [0] is confusing regarding these bits. An older document [1], easier to understand, was used instead. [0] NEC Electronics User's Manual, April 1987. [1] NEC uCOM-87AD Family 8-Bit Microcomputers uPD78C1X Users Manual. Use intermediate flip flops for extended timer/event counter. The extended timer/event counter uses intermediate flip flops (LV0 and LV1) before writing the output to CO0 and CO1. The introduction of LV0/LV1 addresses three issues: Level inversion occurs after the flip flop is output, not before. The intermediate flip flop can be altered without affecting the output of CO0/CO1. upd7810_write_EOM() didn't work properly when the level inversion bit was set along other bits [Ramiro Polla]. Some uPD7810 fixes and code simplification. Interrupt-related fixes. Fixed and improved timer/event counter [Miodrag Milanovic]. Fixed uPD7810 sound/hang regressions in some MAME drivers. Fixed Puzzli sound [Alex Jackson].
- 0.154              : Added cpu\upd7810\upd7810_macros.h. Changed cpu\upd7810\upd7810_dasm.c, upd7810_opcodes.c and upd7810_table.c to 7810dasm.c, 7810dasm.c and 7810tbl.inc. Reorganize uPD7810, compile source files seperately instead of including them into the main source [Dirk Best].
- 0.153              : Changed cpu\upd7810\7810ops.c to 7810ops.inc and 7810tbl.c to 7810tbl.inc [Oliver Stöneberg]. Modernized uPD7810 cpu core [Wilbert Pol]. Added ADC support [Ramiro Polla].
- 0.149              : Removed a no longer needed hack [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.146u2            : Fixed uPD7810 setting of flags in the ACI_[VABCDEHL]_xx functions. Fixed handling of Carry flag in the DAA instruction [Wilbert Pol].

9.5   MC-8123

- 0.186              : Make MC-8123 into a device (chinsan.cpp, freekick.cpp, ninjakd2.cpp, segae.cpp, segas16b.cpp and system1.cpp). Fixed IRQ-related regression in Gigas (freekick.cpp) [AJR].
- 0.183              : Make MC8123 a bit more readable [Vas Crabb].
- 0.176              : Minor doc update [Brian Troha].
- 0.122u4            : "Simplified" MC8123 decryption, though it's still more complicated than I'd like it to be [Nicola Salmoria].
- 0.113u3            : Added machine\mc8123.h. Nicola Salmoria added proper MC8123 decryption code. Hooked up a number of games that were using the chip, making many of them playable.
- 16th March     2007: David Haywood - Now that the MC8123 it's been decrypted I've gone back to looking at Ganbare Chinsan Ooshoubu. The hardware seems quite simple. Fixed colors. And the final previously unemulated game that Nicola's MC8123 work allows to be emulated is DakkoChan House, another Mahjong title, this one running in the system1.c driver. In order to work properly it needs the mahjong control panel emulating correctly (otherwise it hangs when booting) I've started looking at this.
- 15th March     2007: David Haywood - Nicola found a weakness in the way Sega generated their keys for the M8123 which made decrypting Fantasy Zone 2 and Opa Opa much easier than anybody had expected. Both games (running on the System E arcade platform) work fine with the SMS emulation from HazeMD. I need to port this over to MAME so that they work properly in MAME too. Aaron should be thanked too for noticing that the FD1094 keys were generated by a Psuedo-Random number generator rather than actually being Random, this was also found to apply to the MC8123 and was the basis of Nicola's work.
- 14th March     2007: R. Belmont - Nicola has fully cracked the Sega MC8123 encrypted CPU. This means, among other things, that games like Opa Opa and Fantasy Zone 2 now run. MAMEdev was afraid those games might be lost forever, since no working examples were known, but now they'll be back to life.
- 0.112              : Nicola Salmoria improved decryption of MC8123-0054 based on a new dump.
- 0.93               : Pierpaolo Prazzoli and Nicola Salmoria added MC8123 317-0064 decryption table to Ufo Senshi Yohko Chan.
- 0.89u6             : MC8123 update [Nicola Salmoria]. Expanded the decryption tables, they change when bit 15 of the address is set. Table for 317-0066 (Altered Beast) almost complete, but there are still some uncertain values for opcodes above 8000 (not actually needed). Incomplete table for 317-0054 (Shinobi). Still not enough to decrypt the program. Tables for 317-0043 (wbml) and ninjakd2 derived by comparison of the original with the decrypted bootleg. They are incomplete but enough to fully decrypt the program. Unfortunately Block Gal and Perfect Billiards cannot be done in the same way because encrypted and decrypted programs are different versions.
- 0.89u3             : Added machine\mc8123.c. Decryption of MC-8123B 317-0066 encrypted Z80 used by altbeas2 [Nicola Salmoria, Dave Widel].
- NOTES: The NEC MC-8123 is a Z80 with built-in encryption. It contains some battery-backed RAM, when the battery dies the CPU stops working. It was used in a few games; for now, only 317-0066 has been decrypted. It is still not know how much the encryption can vary from one CPU to the other. I've assumed that the encryption tables are hardcoded, and the internal RAM only contains the code of the table to use.

9.69  V53

- 0.161              : Fixed PIT timers, makes BGMs to sound better [Angelo Salese].
- 0.160              : Added cpu\nec\v53.c/h. Start an internal map for the V53. Few bits of V53 stuff, start dynamic peripheral mapping, attempts to set up timers at least. Timer Unit is functionally identical to uPD71054 (which in turn is said to be the same as a pit8253) so give the V53 one of those other peripherals aren't quite identical, just close to other devices (often missing modes or with other limitations). Don't crash V53 on garbage values Roads Edge/Samurai Shodown 64 write on startup. Couple of notes about what the various NEC chips in V53 seem to be cloned from thanks to Carl and R. Belmont, added them for now, will try to hook them up and see how things align in a bit. The V53 SCU is a i8251 clone, but with the command / mode registers separated, and only Asynchronous transfer mode available, this splits the function into something we can use for that purpose. Exposed V53 device callbacks to users. Provided access to the interrupt V53 lines. Hooked V53 irq ack callback so that it can get the correct vector from the controller [David Haywood].
- 0.146u1            : David Haywood added some bits to get the V53 (V33 core) running at least some sane sound code for hng64.c There is no sound yet tho, and the banking mechanism will need hooking up but the initial banks should be correct.
- NOTES: V53 and V53A (V53 below) are one of the NEC V series micrcontrollers. These are microcontroller that integrated some peripherals with V33 cored. Its peripherals are equivalent to V50's peripherals, so that V53 is a microcontroller that replaced V50's core-processor from V30 to V33. And V33 core-processor has compatible instruction set as Intel 8086/80186 microprocessor. Difference between V53 and V53A: It is difference on the core-processor V33 and V33A. At the V33, some intrurupt vector number such as undefined instruction fault are differnt to intel i80X86. At the V33A, these number are re-defined same as intel i80X86 prcessors.
- NOTES: Core-Processor: V33 compatible. Serial I/F: 1 channel (8251 compatible). Timer/Counter: 3 channels (8254 compatible). DMA: 4 channels (8237/8271 compatible). Intrerupt Controller: 8 lines (8259 compatible). BUS I/F: Address: 24bit (selectable address expantion capability like an EMS), Data: 8/16bit (Dynamic bus sizing), Address and Data bus are separated. Minimum two clocks/access, Programmable wait controller (0-7 wait) and DRAM refresh controll. Package: 132pin PGA, QFP120. Operating conditions: Operating Frequency: 2-20MHz and Power consumption: 900mW (@16MHz)

10.4   DECO 45 / HuC6280

- 0.186              : Changed name 'H6280' to 'HuC6280'.
- 0.180              : Changed the H6280 disassembler to use 'std::ostream &' internally [Nathan Woods].
- 14th November  2014: Charles MacDonald - PC Engine FPGA development board: Back in May I designed a development board for the PC-Engine that plugs into the expansion port instead of the card slot. The extra hardware will automatically disable itself when a HuCard is inserted so the console still functions like normal. The new functionality added is as follows: 512K boot ROM (Flash), 1MB SRAM for loading games and programs, High speed USB interface, Stereo audio and RGB video outputs, Nexys2 FPGA development board connector and Reset and IRQ2-triggering buttons. The digital video bus of the PC-Engine is routed to the FPGA connector, allowing the video signals to be processed externally. I'm using it to implement an all-digital line doubler that outputs 31 kHz VGA video. It works by snooping the VCE bus to keep track of color table access and duplicating that information internally, and then performing the raw pixel to color look-up while scanning out the video that was captured. This approach gives one scanline worth of lag from the input to the output, so you don't get the noticable 16ms delay that framebuffer based scan-doublers often have. While the Nexys2 VGA output is slightly limited (having one less bit of blue color resolution than the PC-Engine has) the results look fantastic. What turned out to be troublesome was handling the different pixel clocks the VCE can generate but there are a fixed number of those to deal with at least. Eventually I'd like to make a dedicated scan-doubling card with a pass-through connector so CD games can still be used. It should be possible to make it significantly more compact once the development functions are removed, and with a custom board the video output can be corrected to match the actual VCE color depth.
- 0.153              : Removed h6280\h6280ops.h and tblh6280.inc. Moved contents of .inc into .c to removed #define pollution when including h6280.h. Replaced #defines with inline functions. Renamed functions with upper case names to lower case to avoid #define collisions [smf].

Added 1 cycle for decimal mode ADC and SBC instructions. Changed cycle counts for CSH and CSL instructions to 3. Added T flag support to the SBC instruction. Fixed ADC T flag to set the Z flag based on the value read. Added 3 cycle penalty to ADC, AND, EOR, ORA, and SBC instructions when the T flag is set.

Fixes the following: Mesopotamia: Music tempo & in-game timer, Dragon Saber: DDA effects, Magical Chase: Music tempo and speed regulation, Cadash: Allows the first level to start and Turrican: Allows the game to start. Changed PLX and PLY to set NZ flags. Fixes: Afterburner: Graphics unpacking and Aoi Blink: Collision detection with background. Fixed the decimal version of ADC/SBC to *not* update the V flag, only the binary ones do. Fixed B flag handling so it is always set outside of an interrupt; even after being set by PLP and RTI. Fixed P state after reset to set I and B, leaving T, D cleared and NVZC randomized (cleared in this case). Fixed interrupt processing order (Timer has highest priority followed by IRQ1 and finally IRQ2).
- 0.101u4            : Aaron Giles updated the H6280 CPU to use the new address translation system.
- 20th February  2005: Charles MacDonald - The PCBs for my PC Engine development board arrived last week and I've been working on debugging them since. Most of the problems seemed to be about how the HuC6280 handles a bus transaction when reading or writing memory, it's not nearly as simple as the patents would lead you to believe. The glue logic was implemented on a GAL22V10, which was a good choice as I've been reprogramming it a lot to tweak the design. Once the hardware bugs are resolved, I'm hoping to do some serious work on TGEmu and my PC Engine documentation. I may release the design to the public domain if there is sufficient interest, though it's not that much cheaper compared to Tototek's PCE-PRO 32M Flash Cart. But a DIY project is always rewarding, I was pretty excited when I had Blazing Lazers running for the first time.
- 31st January   2005: Charles MacDonald - I've been finalizing the design for a TurboGrafx-16 / PC Engine development board. It provides a USB interface to a PC to transfer programs, has 512k of flash memory, and 512k of NVRAM. The addressing decoding is flexible so programs can be stored in either or both memories, and "split" HuCard images can be executed out of NVRAM (up to 256k+256k max). I built a simpler prototype on a breadboard that worked fine, the next step is to get some PCBs manufactured after the board layout is verified.

10.7   DECO 102

- 0.174              : Fixed DECO 102 crypt separate compile [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.95u6             : Added machine\deco102.c.
- 0.95u5             : Nicola Salmoria figured out decryption of remaining DECO102 games.
- 0.95u4             : Nicola Salmoria added preliminary decryption to DECO 102 games.
- 22nd April     2005: Nicola Salmoria - Bryan noticed that changing a single value in the Pocket Gal Deluxe decryption (related to the address scrambling) revealed some clear text in Diet Go Go. THis means that the encryption key is almost hardcoded as I expected, but with some minor variation (maybe externally to the DE102 iself). I have isolated the variations in just two numbers, a 16-bit one for the address scrambling and an 8-bit one (or two 4-bit ones) for the data bits permutation and xor. Fine tuning the values to correctly decrypt data in Diet Go Go was easy enough. Double Wings required a little more works, but it was still easy. I just needed to brute force the 16-bit parameter. Doing that was easy because I just had to decrypt the ROM using each possible value for the parameter, and count how many zeros were in the decrypted data. When their number rised from a couple of thousands to tens of thousand, I had a "good enough" value for the parameter, which I could later tweak by hand. So, data was decrypted in all four games (the other one is Boogie Wings which decrypted with the same parameters as Pocket Gal Deluxe), but opcodes were still encrypted. However, most of the work was already done. Even if the opcodes are encrypted differently from data, the address scrambling must of course be the same, otherwise there wouldn't be a 1:1 correlation between logical address and physical address. Therefore, only the data bits permutation and xor changes. The obvious candidate for that variation was the 8-bit parameter. A brute force search was even easier in this case. I just had to try all possible values and count how many times 4E75 (the opcode for RTS) appeared. When it increased from a couple of times to several hundreds, I had the key. So all four known games using this CPU (Pocket Gal Deluxe, Diet Go Go, Double Wings and Boogie Wings) should now be fully decrypted. Non of them is working; for that, the driver will have to be finished, and possibly some more protection worked around. But the first hurdle has been overcome.
- 20th April     2005: Nicola Salmoria - The recent discovery of a decrypted bootleg of Pocket Gal Deluxe was a pleasant surprise. This is one of a handful of games that use the same encrypted custom CPU - called DE102. It is now confirmed that the CPU is a 68000. Thanks to the bootleg, I was able to figure out the decryption algorithm. It is quite straightforward, and it involves: (1) Address scrambling. When the CPU wants to read a word from logical address N, it fetches it from ROM space at address N'. The scrambling of the address requires 16 conditional XORs with 16-bit values. (2) Data bits permutation. After reading the word from ROM, the order of its bits is altered. There are 16 possible permutations; which one to use depends trivially on the logical address and (3) Data XOR. After changing the bit order, the value is XORed with one of 16 other values. Which one to use depends trivially on the logical address. While working on Pcket Gal Deluxe, I was hoping that the DE102 would use a fixed key, which would have emant free decryption of a few other games. Unfortunately, this turned out to not be the case. The algorithm surely is the same, but the key is different. Determining the key without having a decrypted version to compare with is a lot more difficult, as you can imagine. Also, it seems that at least one of the other games encrypts data and opcodes differently, which makes things a lot more complicated. In the next days, I'll see if I can find a way to break the key somehow.

- 0.103u2            : David Haywood added BCD opcodes to 156 / ARM co-processor.
- 31st December  2005: Bryan McPhail - Due to pressing deadlines in 'real' work, this took somewhat longer than I thought to finish off. Unfortunately, although all Deco156 games now boot in MAME, only Night Slashers and Heavy Smash are properly playable. All the other games make use of a math co-processor which is not yet understood. Of the broken games Skull Fang works the most - the attract mode is fully correct, and it's playable up to the first boss. The other games mostly have serious gameplay errors (eg, AI players do not respond correctly in Hoops). Sound is also bust in all of the new games.
-  1st August    2005: David Haywood - Shortly after the release of u3 I made some further improvements to the 156 emulation, removing a kludge (allowing the Eeproms to work) and fixing the music.
- 0.98u3             : Fully emulated DECO 156 encryption [David Haywood, Nicola Salmoria, Olivier Galibert, Bryan McPhail].
- 31st July      2005: David Haywood - Final 156 update for tonight... General: Added Sprites, EEPROM settings don't work on any game and No Sound. Magical Drop / Magical Drop Plus / Chain Reaction: This is highly unstable and prone to crashing, I'm not too sure if its due to protection or CPU bugs, none of the other games behave this badly. Gameplay is also very sluggish. Osman / Cannon Dancer: Still doesn't boot without going into the debugger. Has problems with Sprite colours (16-bit ram on 32-bit bus maybe?) and tile banking. Also tilemaps don't seem large enough at the moment. Party Time: Seems quite playable, some tile bank problems. Charlie Ninja: Tilemaps aren't big enough, sprites are a bad dump, some scrolling problems on title screen (i'm sure it was ok before). Joe And Mac Returns: Playable, although I can set it to either a very fast speed, or a very sluggish speed depending on Vblank, I'm not sure which is correct... Completed a few levels and it didn't crash so it seems ok.
- 30th July      2005: David Haywood - 3 Weeks of staring at numbers solid until 4am, a bit of teamwork with key developers, and we have our first results... (Magical Drop (Deco 156) shows the message: WARNING - GAME MODE SETTING ERROR). Its not much, but maybe a sign of things to come. Update: I moved from Magical Drop to Joe and Mac Returns. Note that the tile roms on both sets are bad dumps, hence the corruption in the screenshots. Sprites haven't been added. Fixed the tile banking for the platforms. 2nd Update: Found a way to get Osman to boot via the debugger and it appears we can fix the Joe & Mac Returns tile rom by using bits from each of the bad dumps. None of these will be playable until the protection has been worked out however.
- 0.98u2             : Some progress on the Deco 156 encryption [David Haywood].
- NOTES: Data East MLC Hardware uses an encrypted CPU labelled 156, which is completely unknown. The encryption is likely very complex because the files in the archive that are encrypted don't compress at all. The decryption is internal to the chip which makes trojaning the board or manual decryption very difficult.
- NOTES: The Data East chip 156 is an encrypted ARM processor.

Fixed behavior of SMLAxy opcode (cpu\arm7\arm7drc.c). Not sure if this is correct, but it looks a lot more correct than before. I'm not actually sure what we have in MAME or MESS that uses ARMv5 opcodes. Fixed SMLAL opcode (looks like another dodgy one), SMULW and SMLAW opcodes [MooglyGuy].
- 0.145u5            : For v5 and later, Thumb POP can return to ARM mode in ARM7 (cpu\arm7\arm7thmb.c) [R. Belmont].

Fixed time running backwards on Thumb instructions. Fixed some ARM instructions doing indiscriminate change_pc()s.
-  9th August 2007   : R. Belmont - DisARMing: Another day, another bunch of dead ARM7 bugs. Good stuff from this batch includes both Metroid games (GBA) now being playable and improved music quality in some games. Cheat sheet on the MAME significance: A good-running ARM7 core will be necessary for future PGM games (as their protection programs are trojaned or decapped) and sound in NAOMI games if/when those are supported. It's much easier to test the core with GBA games though.
-  7th August 2007   : R. Belmont - Ryan and I fixed several more ARM7 core bugs and a few GBA hardware emulation issues, and now many more games boot or are playable that weren't before.
- 0.115u3            : More ARM wrestling: [R. Belmont]: Fixed error in carry propagation on ALU opcodes of the form ALU r1, r2, r3 SHIFTEROP #imm. Fixed Thumb ADD instructions where the PC is involved. Fixed LDMIA to mask off bits 0 and 1 of the destination address. MSR instruction now properly respects processor mode and field code flags.
- 30th May 2007      : R. Belmont - More ARM7 fixes (including several that were backported to the original ARM core - could someone check if it's now possible in 0.115u2 to beat the end boss on Dragon Gun?), so of course I have a few new GBA screens.
- 0.115u1            : Improvements to the ARM7 core [R. Belmont, Ryan Holtz]: Fixed 32-bit unaligned reads to "scramble" properly. Fixed carry flag calc for SUB/SBC/CMP family instructions. Fixed multiply-and-accumulate instructions. Added more instructions to the disassembler. Fixed logical and arithmetic shifts. Added more Thumb instructions. Fixed relative loads and stores. Fixed LSL/LSR with zero shift values. Fixed the disassembly of CMN. Verified behavior when ADD destination is the PC on real h/w.
- 13th May       2007: R. Belmont - More work on the ARM7 SUB/SBC/CMP in Thumb mode were miscalculating the carry flag, and I also improved a few more GBA hardware bits. More games are showing their faces and/or playing better music and/or showing better graphics.
- 0.115              : Additional ARM7 core fixes [R. Belmont]: Fixed SWI instruction in Thumb mode. Rewrote SWP instruction to work properly. Added some missing change_pc()s.
-  5th May       2007: R. Belmont - ARMed and dangerous: MooglyGuy and I shook the ARM7 core and some more bugs fell out, with these results. Keep in mind the GBA video emulation in the driver is extremely simplistic right now, so it's amazing the GBA stuff shows as well as it does. You can't tell here, but all the sound hardware is present and rockin' in most of these games too.
- 0.114u4            : Significant ARM7 update [R. Belmont]: Cleaned up disassembly. Added support for many more Thumb instructions. Removed unnecessary logging. Unaligned reads/writes are supported.
-  1st May       2007: R. Belmont - MAME/MESS's ARM7 core was misinterpreting the very important Thumb version of SWI (SoftWare Interrupt, used on GBA to call the very useful BIOS routines) as 'branch always'. Fixed that, and all sorts of things lit up.
- 0.111u6            : MooglyGuy fixed the disassembly, operation and cycle timing of many Thumb instructions in the ARM7 core.
- 0.109u5            : Aaron Giles converted the ARM7 disassemblers to the new format and added step in/out support where it was obvious.
- 0.105u4            : MooglyGuy improved ARM7 thumb mode disassembler. Big pile of updates/improvements to the ARM7 core thumb mode and the PGM drivers [David Haywood, ElSemi].
-  1st May       2005: David Haywood - Been doing some work with ElSemi updating the Thumb support in the ARM core based on the Nebula code. As a result these are improved (but don't work properly due to various core bugs.) They also run at about 25% speed because the ARM emulation is very demanding. Thanks to Mooglyguy for the original Thumb support.
- 0.104u5            : Preliminary Thumb implementation for the ARM7 core. Many opcodes present, but there are definite sign problems [Ryan Holtz]. Hooked up ARM7 protection CPU in KOV2. Boots but does not run or play due to the Thumb sign problems [R. Belmont].
- 0.91u1             : Trailing comma at the end of an enum (arm7/arm7core.h) [Lawrence Gold].

- 0.147u3            : Rewritten DECO222 encryption for The Real Ghostbusters, Psycho-Nics Oscar and Super Real Darwin to use the new model [Olivier Galibert]. Replaced M6502 CPU with DECO 222.
- NOTES: The DECO 222 or C10707 CPU is a custom 6502. Decrypt CPU1 or CPU2 (audio) roms - see driver btime.c or dec8.cpp
- PCB: C10707-1 (Boomrang, Kamikcab, Oscar, ProSoccer and Sdtennis), unknown 8303 C10707-1 in Shootout

11.1   N2A03

- 0.188              : Fixed cpu\m6502\n2a03.cpp/h [O. Galibert].

- 0.184              : Refactored clock definitions (includes other drivers using the N2A03) [kazblox].
- 0.147u3            : Removed cpu\m6502\opsn2a03.h and tn2a03.c. Added cpu\m6502\dn2a03.lst, n2a03.c/h and on2a03.lst. Rewrite M6502 to modern device, cycle-exact and interruptible. Put a second irq line logically-ored with the normal one in N2A03. Added virtual destructors [O. Galibert].
- 0.129u2            : Wilbert Pol improved implementations for undocumented instructions 63, 67, 6f, 73, 77, 7b, 7f, 9c, 9e, ab, e3, e7, ef, f3, f7, fb and ff in the n2a3 cpu core.
- 0.114u4            : Wilbert Pol improved accuracy of 6502 CPU cores (DECO CPU16, M4510, M6502, M6509, M6510, M6510T, M65C02, M65SC02 and N2A03) to implement the read/write that happens on every cycle. Moved the "undocumented" instructions from the 6510 cores into the main 6502 core, since there were several other versions of the 6502 cores which have the same undocumented instructions. Removed some of the #define override magic that was going on to make the code easier to read and understand. Updated the 6510 core port_read and port_write functions to include the ddr register in the parameters.
- 0.108u5            : Wilbert Pol updated the TN2A03 CPU to match the proper cycle timings and unsupported opcodes revealed by Blargg's NES chip test.
- 0.102u5            : Changed name 'NES' to 'N2A03'.

11.2   G65C816 / 5A22

- 0.185              : Removed a few legacy type macros (cpu\g65816\g65816cm.h). Eliminated uint type properly [AJR].
- 0.180              : Changed the G65816 disassembler to use 'std::ostream &' internally [Nathan Woods].
- 0.175              : Fixed back N5A22 clock steps (cpu/g65816/g65816cm.h; timing bug that was lingering for a while, no idea about what it fixes / breaks for SNES but it doesn't seem harmful from a quick random test) [Angelo Salese].
- 0.154              : Modernised G65C816 cpu core. Fixed SNES regression from modernization (cpu\g65816\g65816.c) [Wilbert Pol]. Fixed usage of uninitialized member in g65816_device [Oliver Stöneberg].

This should be made device_address_map in future but cpu core needs first to be converted to C++ (cpu\g65816\g65816.c and mess\drivers\snes.c) [Miodrag Milanovic]. Added missing mirror of the 5A22 regs (cpu\g65816\g65816.c) [Fabio Priuli].

Rewritten cycle steal code for SNES from scratch and nailed it directly in the G65816 CPU core [Angelo Salese, byuu]. Hooked up fastROM setting in the CPU core and FastROM resets at boot. Fixed a major bug with 5A22 timings, that was incorrectly taking extra steals at every read, write and rmw types of opcode. Moved multiplication and division operation from SNES to 5A22 CPU core file. Small clean-up. Moved MEMSEL as well [Angelo Salese].
- 0.145u7            : Stephane Humbert fixed dipswitches and coin inputs in SNESb driver (after verification of the 5A22 code).
- 0.141u2            : Fixed G65816 operation on PowerPC Linux where char is unsigned [R. Belmont, billb].

- 0.113u4            : G65816/M37710 CPU core updates [R. Belmont]: Fixed a race condition in the WAI instruction where the CPU could get stuck. (MESS bug #661, may have caused intermittent issues with Namco games in MAME too). Fixed block transfer instructions when the accumulator is in short mode. (Fixes some SNES games not booting, notably Final Fantasy Mystic Quest).
- 0.109u5            : Aaron Giles converted the G65816 disassemblers to the new format and added step in/out support where it was obvious.
- 0.107u3            : 65816/377xx update [R. Belmont]: Made block transfer instructions interruptable as they are on both actual chips (previously a single opcode could eat >400,000 cycles with obvious consequences for interrupt timing). Fixed M377xx block transfers (move one less byte than the 65816).
- 0.102u3            : Rob Bohms fixed the ADC and SBC opcodes in G65816 (for BCD math).
- 0.100u4            : Updated 65816 and 37710 cores [R. Belmont]: Fixed both CPUs to set the data bank register to the destination on an MVN/MVP. Some minor tweeks so the debugger works properly when the 65816 is executing out of a read handler (as it always is for the SNES).
- 0.94u2             : Patched G65816 [Nathan Woods]: Fixes a bug whereby the CPU could switch modes without entering the set of functions for that mode. Specifically, if a mode change occurs it will break out of the execute function and reenter the correct function.
- 0.93               : G65816 disassembler changes [Nathan Woods]. program_read_byte() is no longer used for disassembling and also the core now reports the PC as being the full PB or with PC.
- 0.92               : Nathan Woods added a hook that allows a driver to install a custom read handler for reading interrupt vectors (the 65816 has a signal that is asserted when reading a vector and certain hardware needs to reroute the read).
- 0.90u4             : Nathan Woods fixed 65816 DASM error.

- 28th May       2000: Karl Stenerud sent in a new SPC700 CPU core.
- NOTES: The Sony/Nintendo SPC700 CPU is 6502-based at heart but contains a lot of the extended opcodes of the Mitsubishi 770 and 7700 series 65xxx-based MCUs, plus a few special twists borrowed from the 68000. It was designed by Sony's Ken Kutaragi, later the "father of the PlayStation". Original emulation by Anthony Kruize and Lee Hammerton. Thanks to Anonymous, TRAC, Brad Martin, anomie, Blargg, and everyone else on ZSNES Technical for probing the darker corners of the SNES with test programs so we have a chance at getting things accurate.

11.4   DSP-1

- 0.141u1            : Removed machine\snesdsp1.c.
-  2nd January   2011: R. Belmont - Dr. Decapitator recently read out the internal ROMs for the Super NES "DSP-1", "DSP-2", "DSP-3" and "DSP-4" chips. These are all fairly low-powered NEC uPD7725 16-bit DSPs used to offload 3D trig calculations in games like Pilotwings and Super Mario Kart. BYUU wrote an emulation core for this chip for bsnes and kindly donated it to MAME/MESS so now SNES in MESS has perfect math on games using the DSP as well. And the great thing is the previous HLE simulation code used for these games was larger than both the 7725 core and the ROMs. So you save a little compile time and memory and get guaranteed perfect results. I love it!
- 16th December  2010: Dr. Decapitator - SNES DSP1B: The data was extracted by laser-cutting the top two ROM bits from the actual CPU logic (so it would read all opcodes as OP(00) or LD(11) opcodes depending on whether lines were pulled high or low, and neither OP nor LD can branch address), then microprobing, 8 bits at a time, the ROM outputs from before the cut. The program counter was also monitored to ensure that the data read started at 0x000 and didn't jump anywhere. The images included are: 24_bits_11addr.jpg: An overview of the program ROM showing the data bits and the program counter outputs. d77c25_sp_pc_20x.jpg: A closer view of the program counter showing most of the 4-bit parallel stack that is next to it. Thanks to Lord_Nightmare and BYUU+friends for their help with this.

11.8   RSP

- 0.186              : Wrap PC to 12 bits in a few more places (cpu\rsp\rspdrc.cpp and rspfe.cpp) [Happy].
- 0.184              : Let debugger disassembly windows track RSP PC. Flush RSP drc cache when SP DMA changes IMEM (machine\n64.cpp). Make element selection in vector load/store DRC C functions consistent with other implementations (cpu\rsp\rspcp2d.cpp) [Happy].
- 0.180              : Moved the declaration of rsp_dasm_one() to a header file. Changed the RSP disassembler to use 'std::ostream &' internally. Eliminated 'rsp_dasm_one(std::string &string,...' trampoline [Nathan Woods].
- 0.164              : Removed cpu\rsp\rspcp2s.c/h. Added cpu\rsp\clamp.h, vabs.h, vadd.h, vaddc.h, vand.h, vch.h, vcl.h, vcmp.h, vcr.h, vdivh.h, vldst.h, vmac.h, vmov.h, vmrg.h, vmudh.h, vmul.h, vmulh.h, vmull.h, vmulm.h, vmuln.h, vor.h, vrcpsq.h, vrsq.h, vsub.h, vsubc.h and vxor.h. Removed RSP SIMD version. Merging in direct RSP vector opcodes from CEN64. Fixed remaining N64 issues on 32-bit (video\rgbgen.h). Added MCFG_FORCE_NO_DRC option (cpu\rsp\rspdrc.c). Clamp DMEM fetches to 4kb (cpu\rsp\rspcp2.h and vldst.h). Fixed CTC2 and VCH opcodes in RSP SIMD code (cpu\rsp\rspcp2.c) [MooglyGuy]. Make the align declarations GCC-compatible (cpu\rsp\rspcp2.h) [O. Galibert].
- 0.163              : Moved m_op member into a struct so it can be allocated in the DRC cache (cpu\rsp\rspcp2.c). Fixes MT5953: Crash/segmentation fault when running DRC (Linux only) [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.156              : Added cpu\rsp\rspcp2.c/h, rspcp2d.c/h and rspcp2s.c/h. Added destination address support to the BREAK opcode (cpu\rsp\rspfe.c). Abort MIPS timeslice when unhalting RSP. Fixes many RSP tests. Avoid setting the DP_FREEZE bit, gets Banjo-Kazooie to boot (machine\n64.c). Added VNOP, VNULL and VRSQ instructions (cpu\rsp\rspdrc.c). Fixed up how negative values are handled in VRSQL/VRCPL (cpu\rsp\rspdrc.c). Fixed left-shift-of-signed-value issues (cpu\rsp\rspfe.c). Added undocumented ops VADDB, VACCB, VSUBB and VSUCB (cpu\rsp\rspdrc.c). Made the RSP interpreter core functional again. Splitted RSP vector opcodes into separate files for interpreter, DRC and DRC + SIMD. Breaks interpreter mode for reasons yet unknown. Fixed RSP interpreter. Removed timeslice yielding when un-halting RSP, is causing hangs in various N64 games. Optimized accumulator access in multiply instructions (cpu\rsp\rsp.c and rspcp2d.c) [MooglyGuy]. Fixed crash on Linux when recompiling BREAK opcode (cpu\rsp\rspdrc.c) [MooglyGuy, Firewave]. Added command-line option -[no]drc_log_uml to control DRC UML disassembly logging. Allows logging of DRC UML disassembly without re-compiling / removes. DRCUML_OPTION_LOG_UML and all the core-specific LOG_UML defines (cpu\rsp\rsp.c). Added command-line option -[no]drc_log_native to control DRC native diassembly logging. Allows logging of DRC native disassembly without re-compiling, removes DRCUML_OPTION_LOG_NATIVE and all the core-specific LOG_NATIVE defines, added logging() to drcbe_interface and added logging_native() to drcuml_state. Added assert for e.g. n64 -cart waveracej crash in rsp_device::generate_checksum_block() (cpu\rsp\rspdrc.c). Fixed compiling with old (MESS) Apple GCC (hs and hl are unsigned int, and therefore cannot be < 0) (cpu\rsp\rspdrc.c). Fixed Visual Studio warnings about truncated constant and fixed Clang warning (cpu\rsp\rsp.c). Fixed "unresolved external symbol" with RSP during linking with Visual Studio [Oliver Stöneberg]. Fix for compile on GCC 4.4.7 (cpu\rsp\rspcp2d.c) [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.155              : Changed name 'RSP DRC' to 'RSP'. Modernised RSP cpu core [Wilbert Pol]. Fixed "error: zero-length gnu_printf format string" compile issue [Tafoid].
- 0.154              : Moved RSP to use DEVCB2 [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.153              : Silence excessive printf spam in RSP core with -nodrc [Justin Kerk]. Temporarily split all RSP functions into SIMD and scalar versions so that they can more easily be run alongside each other for the purposes of regression testing. Currently SIMD ops introduce some lighting issues, but only when a light and model are axis-aligned, which makes it remarkably difficult to track down based solely on comprehensive logging, so this will eventually allow for running the scalar version of the opcode after the SIMD one in order to deduce exactly which SIMD opcode is divergent. N64 RSP changes [MooglyGuy]: * Added SIMUL_SIMD flag for easy finding of bugs in SIMD opcodes. * Fixed SIMD versions of SSV, SLV, SDV, STV, VSUB, VADDC, VSUBC, and VGE. * Removed SIMD optimizations from VMACF, VMADL, VMADN, as they were provided by the CEN64 author but do not appear to have the same results as MESS's scalar implementations, and so are not trustworthy [MooglyGuy]. Compile fix since not all have SSE3 enabled [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.151              : RSP SIMD changes [MooglyGuy, Marathon Man]: * Converted high and middle accumulator slices into SIMD vectors. * Converted flag registers into SIMD vectors. * Fixed unaligned accesses in CFC2 opcode. * Added SCALAR_GET_VS1, SCALAR_GET_VS2, and SET_ACCUM_H/M/L to act as a passthrough to either the non-SIMD implementation or individual element insert/extract ops in order to minimize #if USE_SIMD all over the place. * Ported SIMD implementations of VMUDL, VMUDM, VMUDN, VMUDH, VMACF, VMACU, VMADL, VMADM, VMADN, and VMADH from CEN64 with permission. * Resulted in an overall speedup of approximately 50% for RSP-bound scenes on a 2.5GHz i5 [MooglyGuy, Marathon Man]. Fixed non-SIMD mode (cpu\rsp\rspdrc.c). Refactored N64 RDP blender to use function arrays in order to flatten inner-loop branch structures for potential performance. Broke blender steps into individual #defines in order to make the functional differences between RDP modes more apparent [MooglyGuy]. N64 RDP and RSP improvements [MooglyGuy, Marathon Man]: * Fixed an RSP DMA edge case when transfer count is greater than 1. * Refactored the RDP blender implementation to use function pointers rather than deep if/else structures in order to reduce branch prediction penalties in the inner software rasterizer loop. * Reduced the likelihood that bad triangle commands due to an RSP crash will crash MESS.
- 0.150              : Changed name 'RSP' to 'RSP DRC'. Made both DRC and Non-DRC compile for MIPS, RSP and SH2 core and added option to enable/disable DRC from command line (-drc -nodrc by default it's on). Added command line option to force DRC C backend (emu\emuopts.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.149u1            : RSP SSE optimizations/changes [MooglyGuy]: Fixed load/store opcodes. Added SSE versions of the following opcodes: VMADH, VADD, VSUB, VADDC, VSUBC, VCH, VCR, VMRG, VAND, VNAND, VOR, VNOR, VXOR and VNXOR.
- 0.149              : Added USE_SIMD flag to RSP headers and began converting some opcodes to use SSE* intrinsics. Current plan is to target SSSE3-capable hardware (Core2 and up), with the resulting speedup theorized to be on the order of 5-10x when conversion is complete, though this applies only to situations where the emulation is heavily bottlenecked by the RSP. Turn off USE_SIMD. Added SIMD code for the rest of the RSP vector load instructions. Removed tmmintrin.h include from cpu\rsp\rspdrc.c [MooglyGuy].
- 0.147u2            : Made RSP core use callbacks (cpu\rsp\rsp.c, rspdrc.c and machine\n64.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.145              : N64 DMA / RSP / RDP optimization and documentation [MooglyGuy]: Start of mass variable renaming / documentation in the RDP core. RSP Opt: Shunt around the core memory system for RSP instruction / data fetches. DMA Opt: Shunt around the core memory system for SP and PI DMA transfers. RDP Opt: Replace 2D switch statement with function table for texel fetching. Replace 3x array lookup for 16-to-32 pixel expansion with 64K LUT. Remove setters / getters in favor of direct member access. Mario 64 saw a speedup from 34.96% to 51.80% in -str 60 -mt on my 3.2GHz i7 and Tetrisphere from 30.75% to 43.05%; global speedup of 1.4x to 1.5x is expected.
- 0.141u1            : Harmony removed fast IMEM and DMEM handlers from the RSP DRC in favor of the core memory system; fixes RSP DRC on 32-bit targets. Fixed RSP core VRSQL implementation.

- 0.138u4            : Angrylion fixed RSP sign issue in VCL opcode. Allow the non-DRC RSP core to build again (controlled by a #define like the SH-2 core) [Atari Ace].
- 0.137u2            : Harmony reworked the entire Nintendo 64 renderer to be class-based. More cleanup to follow. Harmony disabled DRC versions of certain vector load/store operations in the RSP core in order to avoid geometry issues.
- 0.137              : Harmony performed an initial code cleanup pass on the N64 rendering code to make use of booleans and inline variable instantiation, and removed a number of unused variables that were exposed as a result of the latter.
- 0.136u1            : RSP DRC changes [Aaron Giles]: Fixed misaligned 32-bit accesses. Disabled DRC_SQV implementation as it breaks music in Magical Tetris Challenge. Converted RSP callbacks into device callbacks. Removed a ton of tag-based queries in favor of using the device passed. Added profiler_mark() calls around rdp_process_list() so that the RDP time is separated from the RSP time.
- 0.136              : Harmony converted a number of vector opcodes to the RSP DRC core, unrolled and optimized a number of vector opcodes in the interpreter RSP core and fixed a few DRC-ized vector load/store opcodes in the RSP core. Aaron Giles re-implemented misaligned memory handling in the RSP DRC as before and explicitly sign-extend 32-bit indexes for load/loads/store on 64-bit machines to prevent overflow issues. Fixes DRC crash in 'Magical Tetris Challenge'.
- 0.135u4            : Added cpu\rsp\rspdrc.c and rspfe.c/h. Preliminary RSP recompiler, with all vector ops stubbed out to C functions for now [Harmony]. RSP recompiler improvements / optimizations [Harmony]: Split SATURATE_ACCUM into a signed and unsigned version to reduce stack usage. Corrected an issue with the 0h variants of VMRG, VAND, VNAND, VOR, VNOR, VXOR and VNXOR. Slightly optimized unaligned reads and writes. Optimized unaligned dword reads. Corrected an issue where badly-written RSP programs could jump to invalid addresses.
- 0.135u1            : Angrylion added missing BLTZAL opcode to the RSP core.
- 18th February  2009: MooglyGuy - I've decided to take a short break from working on renderer issues, insofar as pretty much every single game that doesn't run into some sort of bug lurking in machine\n64.c or some sort of MIPS CPU bug has largely correct graphics. The few games that do run up to a machine\n64.c-related bug or MIPS CPU bug also have largely correct graphics. Barring a few exceptional cases, these games would be playable if not for the aforementioned bugs and/or performance. Since I am not quite familiar enough with the N64's non-graphical functions to be comfortable bug-hunting in those realms, for now I'm going to concentrate on performance. Using MAME's built-in profiler to determine CPU load distributions across the main CPU, RSP, and everything else (mainly the RDP), I can break the games down into four categories: * Untestably broken: These games include Indiana Jones, Battle for Naboo, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Banjo-Kazooie, Banjo-Tooie, Donkey Kong 64, Mario Party 3, Paper Mario, Perfect Dark, Goldeneye, Yoshi's Story, Gauntlet Legends, Turok - Rage Wars, and I'm sure plenty of others. Games that don't show a single thing in MESS before running off into the weeds. * 2D Games: These games largely only use the RSP for audio processing, and limit their use of the RDP to things like Textured Rectangle commands. As a result, performance data indicates the RDP as being the main bottleneck for them. These games include Bust-A-Move 2: Arcade Edition and Bust-A-Move '99. * 3D Games: These games use the RSP to do a whole bunch of vector calculations, and use the RDP as much as they want. These are the majority of games, and include Super Mario 64, Mario Kart 64, Army Men: Sarge's Heroes, Tetrisphere, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, Madden 64, and Aidyn Chronicles: The First Mage. * Namco Museum 64: This game is Namco Museum 64. It does not use the RSP at all and does not use the RDP at all. It shoves PCM data out the stereo DAC by way of the main CPU, and it uses the N64's entire video system for nothing other than a framebuffer. As a result, it runs at around 160% when unthrottled, compare with 10% unthrottled for most 3D games and 25% unthrottled for most 2D games. It is the only game of its kind that I know of. In order to more accurately nail down the performance of 3D games, I've run a profile on three games: Castlevania, Tom & Jerry: Fists of Furry, and Super Mario 64. Unsurprisingly, due to the immensely small number of different microcodes that were ever used on the N64, the code profiles look largely the same. The percentages listed are the percentage of execution time spent in each function, not including children. As I see it, the first priority is to convert the RSP core over to use MAME's DRC system. Unfortunately, I'm not quite sure what sort of performance increase will be seen by DRC-ifying the RSP. The VMAC* and VMUD* opcodes have a rather large amount of code associated with them, and not only that, they loop 8 times across 8 elements. This was probably accomplished in parallel on the real RSP. Another piece of low-hanging fruit is the fact that around 10% of the execution time is taken up by memory accessors thanks to the RSP's less-than-optimal IMEM and DMEM implementation. The RSP has to hit the memory system for every single read and write that it does. However, in reality IMEM and DMEM are accessed far, far less often by the main CPU than they are by the RSP itself. It therefore makes better performance sense to have two 4kbyte arrays central to the RSP core itself, which it will access directly rather than going through MAME's core memory accessors. The main CPU will be able to access these memory spaces by querying the RSP core, and any RSP DMA accesses can be done by simply grabbing a pointer into the RSP's IMEM or DMEM arrays, just like it works now. Lastly, the plan is to wire the RDP emulation up to MAME's "work unit" system, which will allow it to distribute drawing commands across multiple CPU cores when available. Unfortunately, the RDP being as slow as it is, it will likely not have too terribly much of a performance impact on my laptop, but it might improve in the situation of a quad-core CPU. Anyway, that's the main plan. Here's hoping I can stick to it.
- 31st January   2009: MooglyGuy - I finally decided to figure out why the scene geometry in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is so screwed up. As it turns out, RSP DMA transfers should have their length rounded up to the next 8 bytes, not the next 4. Since it's kind of hard to get the dramatic change across with still shots, I broke out the -aviwrite parameter and uploaded a couple of videos to YouTube.
- 0.128u6            : Pointer-ified the RSP CPU core [Aaron Giles].
- 0.122u7            : RSP Changes [SGINut, Nicola Salmoria, Ville Linde]: Initialize RSP registers to 0 in lieu of mame_rand. Re-fix RSP single-stepping mode when set by another CPU. Reading the RSP PC returns only the least significant 12 bits. Fixed flag behavior when read out via CFC2. Fixed RSP VRCP instruction to match the real hardware results. Corrected VRCP element lookup. Corrected unaligned DMA behavior.
- 16th January   2008: MooglyGuy - One Step Forward and No Steps Back. A couple new discoveries: * The RSP's registers power up to a random state, excluding accumulators, which are initialized to zero. * The RSP executes exactly one instruction before kicking into single-step mode, rather than immediately changing modes. What's next? Who knows!
- 0.122u6            : Minor RSP fixes [SGINut]: Fixed accumulator state on powerup by testing against real hardware. Fixed single-step behavior by testing against real hardware.
- 0.121u2            : More formally separated the RSP core from the N64 driver [Atari Ace].
- 26th August    2007: MooglyGuy - Making progress on the RSP probe. Over the past few days I've been putting the polishing touches on the user interface for the RSP Probe section of the test suite; the only remaining task is to write the actual probe code itself. This isn't as absurd as it sounds; in fact, the probe code will be rather elementary, as I've already written standalone versions to test individual opcodes, and by and large it'll be a copy/paste job. The most difficult issue so far has been how to present the appropriate amount of data to the user for tweakage. The main issue with regards to the interface was how to deal with series of flag-affecting opcodes. I hadn't thought of this until I looked at opcodes on an individual basis, but there are some ops where the behavior is dependent on the compare, carry, or zero flags when entering the instruction, and can subsequently modify those flags for further use. As it turns out, the maximum number of chained instructions is around three, so it was a simple matter of having three opcode selectors that are enabled and disabled when the appropriate opcode is selected in the selector before it.
-  6th July      2007: MooglyGuy - I've started to work on RSP Probing. This is somewhat of a challenge from a user interface standpoint; previously, any testing was done by me hand-assembling RSP instructions and surrounding them with the appropriate MTC2, ADDI (to tweak the numeric parameters) and branch opcodes, converting the resulting binary into a header file containing an array of 4096 pre-defined bytes, and then recompiling the probe. In this case, I have to find some way of encapsulating that behavior into a pretty interface so that the end user doesn't have to recompile the probe every time he or she wishes to test a new opcode. My current plan of action is to let the user select the following parameters: 1. Opcode to test. 2. Vector parameter increment values for parameters 0 through 7. 3. Start and end values. 4. Load address and load values (for vector-load opcodes). 5. Store address (for vector-store opcodes). One issue to which I am acquainted is the fact that some vector opcodes use one vector as an input parameter, whereas others use two vectors. Some opcodes load a vector's parameters from DMEM, others store the parameters into DMEM. What I'm considering is having the probe simply fill the secondary input vector with parameters in the reverse order as the primary input vector in the case of opcodes that have two input vectors. The planned method for handling load and store opcodes is to have the necessary additional user-tweakable parameters appear when the user selects the relevant opcodes on the opcode toggle. This is going to be a bit of a pain, in that it will tax the UI framework that I've put together for the probe, but it shouldn't be anything that I can't handle.
-  5th July      2007: MooglyGuy - I've drawn up a basic block diagram of the N64's architecture. 1. RCP - Reality Central Processor. MIPS chip model R4300. Clocked at approximately 94MHz, with 16kbytes of instruction cache and 8kbytes of data cache (though the listed cache sizes are questionable). Integrates standard COP0 (MMU) and COP1 (FPU) modules. 2. RDRAM - The Nintendo 64's base configuration contains 4Mbytes of RDRAM located at the expected place in KUSEG, KSEG0 and KSEG1. An additional 4Mbytes is mapped directly after the first 4Mbytes if the user has a memory expansion pack inserted into the memory expansion slot. 3. RSP - Reality Signal Processor. Depending on how you look at it, it's either a standard MIPS chip on testosterone or a standard MIPS chip on an antiandrogen. It was designed specifically to handle display lists and audio lists. Its status is partially accessible by the RCP as COP2. The RSP has no MMU or FPU; COP0 access maps to the RDP (4)'s status and command buffer, COP1 does not exist, and COP2 maps to a custom vector instruction set designed specifically for the Nintendo 64, though it is rumored that the instruction set is the predecessor to the VICE multimedia extensions found in the Silicon Graphics O2 workstation. The RSP's vector extensions give the RSP an additional 32 vector registers; each register is 128 bits wide, made up of eight 16-bit fixed-point values that are accessible in various combinations based on bitfields present in the vector-specific instructions. The vector registers can also be accessed manually via MFC2 and MTC2 instructions. In addition, there are eight 64-bit-wide accumulator registers that are accessible only through individual vector-related instructions. To call the RSP's memory architecture bizarre would be an understatement; its instruction cache (8kbytes) and data cache (8kbytes) have been repurposed into the only memory accessible to the RSP. Furthermore, the RSP uses Harvard architecture, limiting data fetches to DMEM and instruction fetches to IMEM. Both IMEM and DMEM are mapped into the RCP's memory space; both the RCP and RSP may initiate DMA transfers to and from RDRAM, and the RCP can manually access the RSP's memory area, though manual access is subject to caching. In both this respect and the additional vector instructions, the RSP can be likened to one of the Playstation 2's VU1 or one of the Playstation 3's SPUs. I could provide more information, but this entry is already quite long, so if any further information is desired, drop me a line at my above-listed locations. 4. RDP - Reality Display Processor. This is what handles most - not all - graphical capabilities for the Nintendo 64 (more on that in a moment). It pulls 64-bit-wide command packets from either RDRAM or RSP DMEM depending on a bit in its status register. Command packets can range from a single 64-bit word (Full Sync, Sync Pipe, Set Color Image, Load TLUT, et cetera) to 22 words (Triangle with Gouraud, Texture and Z-Buffering). While it is not as fast in terms of fill rate as the Playstation 1's GPU, it makes up for it in feature richness. It supports significantly more texture formats than either the Sega Saturn (which is ostensibly not a 3D system, anyway) or the Playstation, including YUV16, Intensity (grayscale texture tinted by a specified primitive color, useful for particle effects) and Intensity with Alpha. It features a four-parameter color combiner which implements the equation (A - B) * C + D separately for both RGB and Alpha, as well as four-parameter blending with optional two-cycle mode (with the expected throughput penalty, of course); in fact, the Color Combiner is sufficiently advanced that outside of software rasterization, one needs full pixel shader support in order to fully emulate its features. The RDP's framebuffer and Z buffer are stored directly in RDRAM. 5. VI - Video Interface. It's fairly unremarkable, as it is designed to be. It handles low-level signal generation, allowing framebuffer origin, color burst, horizontal sync, vertical sync, and other signal-related parameters to be tweaked to the engineer's liking. More usefully, it is worth noting that since the framebuffer is memory-mapped instead of being in a separate CPU-inaccessible region of memory as with the Playstation 1, framebuffer effects are a cinch. 6. Cartridge Memory - This is worth noting, as the cartridge is mapped at 0xb0000000, not 0xbfc00000. In fact, a cartridge is not bootable. The Nintendo 64's Peripheral Interface contains four kbytes of embedded ROM which is initially mapped into memory, but becomes invisible after a certain (as yet unknown) number of cycles. Its job is to perform initial handshaking with the security IC on a cartridge, then subsequently perform a DMA transfer to move a specific portion of the cartridge's memory into KSEG0, at which point the RCP jumps to 0x80000400. While the RCP can access cartridge memory directly, it is much more efficient to simply perform a DMA transfer as necessary. 7. RSP Access - This is labeled simply because of the multitude of ways that the RCP and RSP can communicate. First and foremost, the RCP can read and write the RSP's status registers - including PC. The main status register for the RSP has eight semaphores that serve specifically as a way to communicate without having to yank a full interrupt on the RCP. As mentioned in section (3), the RSP's IMEM and DMEM ranges are accessible from the RCP as well, but are subject to caching. Lastly, both the RCP and RSP can initiate a DMA transfer of IMEM, DMEM or both ranges. Hopefully this provides some insight into the strange, convoluted world that is the Nintendo 64.

-  4th May       2007: MooglyGuy - I've been thinking of writing a complete test tool for the Nintendo 64 hardware. As it is currently planned, the test tool will have the following features: 1. Memory Probe: View memory (U8 / U16 / U32 / S8 / S16 / S32 / Float), Write memory (U8 only) and Memory Playback - build a list of addresses and values that will be written to in one go. Useful for triggering a DMA transfer or other event that requires multiple register accesses acros a short period of time. 2. RSP Probe: Harness for hooking up a C-based RSP core for parallel testing. Pull register contents into main memory for viewing. Direct read/write access into IMEM and DMEM via the Memory Probe. Manual single-step and Program Counter control. 3. RDP Probe: RDP packet constructor. Choose packet type from a verbal list. Set named parameters rather than arbitrary 32-bit words. RDP packet playback; playback a sequence of packets transcribed by MAME, or your own emulator if you conform to the same specification.
-  6th April     2007: MooglyGuy - She'll Dance: At first, I was under the impression that it would take a prohibitive amount of time to comprehensively test the reciprocal and reciprocal square-root functions due to the fact that VRCPH/L and VRSQH/L operate on 32-bit operands, and it takes long enough to do a test run of a standard single-element opcode. Initial estimates based on 8 hours for a 2^14-iteration test on a given opcode resulted in a rough guesstimate of approximately 60 years(!) to run through all possible values for both VRCPH/L and VRSQH/L. However, whilst daydreaming at work today, I hit upon the notion that it might enter the realm of feasibility if I were to cut out the main two bottlenecks - most notably the full register mirroring, opcode-level interleave, and general emulation of the full RSP. With that in mind, I went about writing a very short function to populate the entirety of DMEM with a given span of 0x800 reciprocal values, and a custom function to calculate what the emulator would generate based on simply copy/pasting the single opcode's source into a for loop. Amazingly, this managed to reduce the time domain from taking on the order of 32 hours to test all 2^16 input values for an opcode to two seconds. At this point, it appears that a conservative estimate would be approximately 24 to 48 hours to test all possible values of VRCPH and VRCPL. Since I do not currently have a DexDrive or memory pack, I will be dumping all discrepant values to the screen and transcribing them - not anywhere near as Sisyphean a task as transcribing all values in their entirety. With that, I leave you with a snapshot of the first page of values for me to transcribe.
-  5th April     2007: MooglyGuy - Theatre of the Macabre: Several points to touch upon: As it turns out, the massive geometry corruption in the Zelda games as well as Diddy Kong Racing and Mickey's Speedway is due to unaligned DMA. Apparently this is causing trashed display lists to be sent, which is naturally a bad thing. This is likely due to a CPU core bug, though I will be writing a separate probe program to test behavior when performing unaligned DMA anyway. As it turns out, my initial fix to VRCP was only a fix for the gross inaccuracy in looking up the appropriate element. After extended testing, it has been discovered that some values will occasionally generate a result that is very slightly different between the N64 and emulated RSP, for no apparent reason. For a solution, see the point below. An anonymous contributor has suggested simply dumping out full tables for all values that VRCP, VRCPH/VRCPL, VRSQH and VRSQL can generate, storing the results on a memory pack which can then be read on the PC via a DexDrive. However, one point I failed to note during the discussion was that while VRCP works with a single 16-bit element, VRCPH/L and VRSQH/L utilize two 16-bit elements to form a 32-bit value. Hence, full tables would be prohibitive in size. However, a viable alternative is to store a table (presumably much smaller) of only those values that differ between cores. It's a hack, granted, but it still results in the proper effect.
- 31st March     2007: MooglyGuy - New Math: A few new test items this afternoon: Opcode / Description / Status: VADD - Vector - Add Pass (tentative); VSUB - Vector Subtract -> Pass (tentative); VABS - Vector Absolute Value -> Pass (tentative); VADDC - Vector Add w/ Carry -> Pass (tentative); VSUBC - Vector Subtract w/ Carry -> Pass (tentative) and VRCP - Vector Reciprocal -> Fixed. I'm tentatively marking VADD*/VABS/VSUB* as passing - it's run through about 4% of the test suite values right now, but typically if it hasn't failed by now it's not going to. Addendum: It just occurred to me that I should probably mark VSAW (Vector Store Accumulator Word) as passing as well. I use it to transfer the accumulators into a vector, which I then write to DMEM, in the register-transfer function of the RSP probe. Since the transfer function works on both the N64 and MESS, it's an incidental test, so it's obviously fine.
- 31st March     2007: MooglyGuy - Shave and a Haircut: The clipping operations seem to check out: Opcode - Description - Status: VCL - Vector Clip -> Low Pass; VCH - Vector Clip High -> Pass and VCR - Vector Clip Reverse -> Pass. Also, it would appear that there's some confusion with regards to what I'm currently doing, due to an update that I failed to post: I found out what was preventing the patched core from working, so I am now back to testing individual opcodes against the Nintendo 64 itself.
- 30th March     2007: MooglyGuy - Discordianism: A hodge-podge of opcode updates: Opcode - Description - Status; VAND - Vector AND -> Pass; VNAND - Vector Not AND -> Pass; VOR - Vector OR -> Pass; VNOR - Vector Not OR -> Pass; VXOR - Vector Exclusive OR -> Pass; VNXOR - Vector Not Exclusive OR -> Pass; VCL - Vector Clip Low -> Pass; VCH - Vector Clip High -> Pass and VCR - Vector Clip Reverse -> Pass.
- 30th March     2007: MooglyGuy - The Programmer's Stone: Latest opcodes to undergo testing: VRSQL / VRSQH: Vector Reciprocal Square-root Low/High. First verified inaccuracy. Shouldn't subtract the destination element off of 7 when looking up the destination element, just use the value encoded in the opcode. VRCPL / VRCPH: Vector Reciprocal Low/High. Same issue.
- 24th March     2007: MooglyGuy - Wonder Twins: I probably should have done this after first applying it, but I have discovered that the patch that made the RSP core endian-independent also managed to prevent any games from working now. With that in mind, I am currently bolting the original, endian-dependent RSP core onto the new, endian-independent RSP core, without actually making it a separate CPU core. Before each opcode is executed, it will synchronize the bolted-on RSP's data memory (hacked into a separate array) with the main RSP data memory, and after each opcode, it will compare the separate fake DMEM and register state with the endian-independent RSP's DMEM and register state. If there's a desync, it will fatalerror, and inform me of the current Program Counter so that I can see what opcode I need to fix in the endian-independent core. Simple, right?
- 24th March     2007: MooglyGuy - Irrational Exuberance => VMULF: Pass
- 24th March     2007: MooglyGuy - Electric Avenue: At the moment, VMULF is undergoing unit testing. It consists of loading s0 with a value, then loading it into each of the elements in v1 and v2, then executing VMULF v0, v1, v2. This will load v0 with v1 * v2 * 2. The current test harness loads s0 with 0 and subsequently adds 0x0011 to s0 with each iteration. This strikes me as a fair enough balance between comprehensiveness, given that running 65536 iterations would be prohibitive, whereas 3855 iterations (0xFFFF / 0x0011 = 0x0F0F) is comprehensive enough, ensures that the elusive 0xFFFF edge case will be tested, and is still quick enough to be able to run to completion through the night. As I type up this entry, it's up to 0x2222. Hopefully, by tomorrow morning, it will still be running, and will have rolled over!
- 18th March     2007: MooglyGuy - 1 In 10 Will Enjoy It: Well, the RSP probe seems to be working. Hooray! I've highlighted the registers and their corresponding positions in vector register 0. It'd reflect the lower 16 bits of r16 through r23, but as you can see, the registers were in the middle of updating when I snapped the picture. I ended up having to implement a couple of workarounds. First, you'll notice that there appears to be a lot of strange contents in the registers. That's because the RSP's registers are in a randomized state on powerup. For what it's worth, though, they appear to be in the same random state every powerup, so theoretically it would be a trivial matter to emulate them with such values. For now, though, I put in a workaround such that it first copies the real registers into the emulated registers so as to not throw a spurious mismatch. Secondly, single-stepping mode does not handle jumps gracefully, and so I've made it so that the prober does not attempt to run the register-copy function if the RSP is in the middle of a jump. Anyway, now it's pretty much on the eminent Ville Linde to write the proper probe code rather than the rudimentary test data that I'm using. Still, good stuff all around.
- 16th March     2007: MooglyGuy - Alas, Poor Yorick: Well, the Doctor V64 arrived, and it works perfectly. The RSP probe, on the other hand, does not. I've commented out everything that tries to touch the RSP directly, leaving it just emulating the RSP and updating the display on-screen, but even then it just gives me a black screen. I'll be damned if anything is occurring to me immediately offhand as to what the problem could be, given that the demonstration program that hcs includes with alt-libn64 works fine, and I've made only minimal modifications to its functionality. Ah well, I'll take a look at it after a touch of WoW. Yeah, I know.
-  9th March     2007: MooglyGuy - Highway To Hell: Actually, it's faux-failure - I intentionally induced an error in the CPU core to make it fail. It will automatically dump out any mismatching GPRs, vector registers and accumulators that do not match, as well as their previous states (which is admittedly redundant to display twice) and the twin program counters (emulated and real) onto the screen for easy debugging. The next step, as I wait for the Doctor V64 to arrive from the UK, is to add other functionality such as being able to page through a display of the entire register set after a mismatch. In addition, yesterday I found the first - arguably most important for the trojaning effort - thing to figure out about the N64's hardware: how the RSP handles setting the program counter while handling a branch in single-step mode. Think about it: The RSP single-steps through a branch, but there is still another instruction to be executed immediately after. While the RSP is halted, you set the PC to be elsewhere. What happens? We shall see.
-  6th March     2007: MooglyGuy - That's A Big Twinkie: What is shown in that picture is an emulated N64 displaying the register contents of an emulated RSP being emulated on that emulated N64, the RSP having just run a short bit of code. For all intents and purposes, I now have a program which can conceivably run test code on a real Nintendo 64. I expect once the Doctor V64 is in my possession that it won't run on a real Nintendo 64, because that's how my luck has been. However, for now, take comfort in the thought that perfect RSP emulation may soon be a reality.
-  3rd March     2007: MooglyGuy - The Late Night Double-Feature Picture Show: I managed to optimize the register usage of the RSP register-transfer function. My original plan was to limit unit testing to vector operations only, but in the event that a full test is ever desired, it should now be possible to test all instructions' effects on all general-purpose registers except one (t0) now. I've hard-coded the register-display function to show "0xdeadbeef" for registers that can't be tested. I suppose marking r0 as untestable is a bit unfair, but there's just not a whole hell of a lot to test.
-  3rd March     2007: MooglyGuy - Baby Steps: A couple new developments. First of all, thanks to an anonymous donator, I will soon be in the possession of a Doctor V64 unit with which I can run test code on a real N64 - this is when the magic starts to happen. The current plan of attack for probing the behavior of the RSP is to directly port MAME's current RSP core to the N64 itself, and to run the emulated RSP in lockstep with the real RSP, verifying the vector register contents after each instruction (it can be safely assumed that non-special opcodes are in good condition already). According to documentation, the RSP has facilities for running in single-stepping mode such that it will automatically halt after executing one instruction, though I have not heard any verification as to whether or not this works as expected. Second of all, the prober is slowly starting to take shape. The first step, getting a C compiler running that can cross-compile for the N64, has taken place. Currently all the test code does is pull values from the area of RSP DMEM that I have reserved for the RSP-side code to copy the vector registers, but the hard part (getting a viable C compiling environment and the ability to display text on-screen) is done. The next step, over the next day or two, will be for me to graft MAME's RSP core into this new codebase, but that should be reasonably simple.
- 24th February  2007: MooglyGuy - Jiggery-Pokery: First up, thanks to some help from pinchy, the N64 driver in MESS 0.113 should boot via a proper PIF ROM dump rather than the faking it (and most N64 emulators) currently use. Apparently it's been floating around for a while now, but nobody knew how to hook it up right. If you don't understand what I just said, then you are probably the same kind of person who loves UltraHLE and drove an emulation-savvy acquaintance of mine into hiding, so go do some Googling, then come back. After making a particular opcode, 0x7C1C97C0, recompile as a NOP rather than not recompile at all, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time boots right up and looks ugly as sin. Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask also boots right up. However, I think that this is an incorrectly-named dump. It is, in fact, a dump of "The Adventures of Link in Bizarro RSP Land and the Quest to Buy MooglyGuy a Doctor V64 so that He and Ville Can Fix the Damn Thing". Diddy Kong Racing boots, but dies on an unaligned RSP DMA: sp_dma (RSP): sp_dram_addr unaligned: 0021DB86. Jet Force Gemini runs through its initial loading screens, and then is polite enough to inform me that the RSP has managed to crash. As for the rest of the CIC-6105 games that I know of offhand, Donkey Kong 64, Perfect Dark and Banjo-Tooie simply do nothing. Conker's Bad Fur Day, in keeping with its bad-boy reputation, feels the obligation to make MESS segfault. Mickey's Speedway USA, as if anyone needed any more proof that it's based on the Diddy Kong Racing engine, also dies with an unaligned RSP DMA: sp_dma (RSP): sp_dram_addr unaligned: 002A7DBA. If anyone wishes to see snappier progress on the N64, I would highly advise purchasing a Doctor V64, V64jr, or CD64 unit for myself, Ville Linde, or both of us. Or you could keep waiting around for Project 64 1.7, which will be out shortly after I have grown old and died.

- NOTES: The Nintendo/SGI Reality Signal Processor (RSP) is depending on how you look at it, it's either a standard MIPS chip on testosterone or a standard MIPS chip on an antiandrogen. It was designed specifically to handle display lists and audio lists. Its status is partially accessible by the RCP as COP2. The RSP has no MMU or FPU; COP0 access maps to the RDP (4)'s status and command buffer, COP1 does not exist, and COP2 maps to a custom vector instruction set designed specifically for the Nintendo 64, though it is rumored that the instruction set is the predecessor to the VICE multimedia extensions found in the Silicon Graphics O2 workstation. The RSP's vector extensions give the RSP an additional 32 vector registers; each register is 128 bits wide, made up of eight 16-bit fixed-point values that are accessible in various combinations based on bitfields present in the vector-specific instructions. The vector registers can also be accessed manually via MFC2 and MTC2 instructions. In addition, there are eight 64-bit-wide accumulator registers that are accessible only through individual vector-related instructions. To call the RSP's memory architecture bizarre would be an understatement; its instruction cache (8kbytes) and data cache (8kbytes) have been repurposed into the only memory accessible to the RSP. Furthermore, the RSP uses Harvard architecture, limiting data fetches to DMEM and instruction fetches to IMEM. Both IMEM and DMEM are mapped into the RCP's memory space; both the RCP and RSP may initiate DMA transfers to and from RDRAM, and the RCP can manually access the RSP's memory area, though manual access is subject to caching. In both this respect and the additional vector instructions, the RSP can be likened to one of the Playstation 2's VU1 or one of the Playstation 3's SPUs. I could provide more information, but this entry is already quite long, so if any further information is desired, drop me a line at my above-listed locations.

11.9   RCP
- 18th January   2008: MooglyGuy - I seem to have discovered a fairly major issue in the way MAME indexes the elements in the VRCP opcode versus the way the real N64 indexes them. Running a very simple test on VRCP with 0001 as the first word in V[0] and 0000 as the remaining words, here are the results of various combinations of element parameters and VS1REG parameters in MAME (see http://www.moogle-tech.com/smf/index.php?topic=4.0). Quite a bit different. For what it's worth, I'm pretty sure that this can be fixed by replacing the assignment of sel in VRCP, VRCPH and VRCPL simply with "EL & 7" rather than the convoluted "VEC_EL_2(EL, del)". The only testing I did was to make that modification in MAME and then run Mario 64 and Mario Kart 64; neither was broken any worse than before, but neither was fixed any more than before either - I'd do more comprehensive testing, but I'm heading to bed immediately after posting this because I'm fricking exhausted.
- NOTES: The Reality Central Processor (RCP) is a MIPS chip model R4300. Clocked at approximately 94MHz, with 16kbytes of instruction cache and 8kbytes of data cache (though the listed cache sizes are questionable). Integrates standard COP0 (MMU) and COP1 (FPU) modules.

Happens with e.g. (MESS) n64 -cart blastcrpu1. Enabled the RDP range checks by default for now (video\n64.h). This reports some out-of-bounds accesses only ubsan would report otherwise - happens with e.g. (MESS) n64 -cart nbaliv99u. Added another check for unsupported FBSize. Happens with (MESS) n64 -cart sbowlingj (video\rdpspn16.c). Added assert for usage of uninitialized stack memory in n64_rdp::SpanDraw1Cycle(). Happens with e.g. n64 -cart vprowrs2 - it actually already goes out of bounds in poly_manager::render_triangle_custom() but since that code is generic it's hard to add an assert there / also added another FBSize check (video\n64.c and rdpspn16.c) [Oliver Stöneberg].

Note: For those interested in that sort of thing, I'm achieving thread safety using the slow-but-sure method: Mirror all main-thread-mutable and render-thread-readable data into a per-span structure. If anyone has any suggestions on how better to sync per-scanline state than what I'm currently doing, I'd be all ears. The renderer is now pretty darn fast, but every little bit counts.

- 25th September 2008: MooglyGuy - After making the decision to remove my original alpha-rejection code as it was causing more bugs than it was fixing, I began the arduous process of tracking down the multitude of ways in which the Nintendo 64 can handle textures that need an alpha border to be cut out. First, I ran across Quake 64, which uses the RDP's Alpha Compare functionality to cut out its font. Alpha Compare is relatively simple - it takes place after the Color Combiner stage and before the Blender stage. If the alpha value of the color output by the Color Combiner is less than or equal to the alpha value specified in the Blend Color register, the RDP will not pass that pixel into the Blender. If the combined alpha is greater than the alpha value specified in the Blend Color register, the RDP will rasterize the pixel through the Blender. Next, I finally came to the realization that there is no other form of automatic pixel rejection based on an alpha value, thanks to a tip from a fellow who goes by the nickname of 'Happy'. He put forth the idea that the N64 only supports Alpha Compare and no other method for automatic pixel rejection, which caused me to look a bit closer at things like the karts in Mario Kart 64 and the trees in Super Mario 64. Sure enough, it turns out that I had to emulate the effects of the "Coverage Times Alpha" bit in the Set Other Modes command. I was only emulating the "Use Coverage As Alpha" bit, and since the transparent pixels were fully covered, they were being rasterized due to their coverage being non-zero. However, the pixel alpha value was, in fact, zero, so multiplying the coverage value by zero resulted in a final blended alpha of zero! Brilliant!  Mario Kart 64 and Super Mario 64 now look much better. I then turned to Space Station: Silicon Valley, wherein the Take 2 logo was completely black. It turns out that if both alpha values of the second Blend cycle are zero, the pixel does not become zero - in fact, the cycle is then just ignored. A quick fix later and the logo sprang to life. Lastly is a personally controversial fix in that it wasn't until this blog post that I realized that the fix I came up with causes problems in other games. In Bust-A-Move 2, there is an animated ground plane that is drawn line-by-line down the screen. The topmost line of the plane actually has a T coordinate of 160.0, and as a result the Set Tile Size command sets the tile's T base to be 160.0. However, the S and T mask bits were set to 7, which results in the coordinates mirroring from 0 to 127 and back. Since the texture coordinates were being adjusted by the values in the Set Tile Size command after mirroring, and the mirroring was affecting the coordinates, they were not remaining at the appropriate position.Before my modification to the order of coordinate adjustment, the ground plane looked like this. Unfortunately, I discovered when writing this blog post that the same change seems to affect the text in some games, so it will need further examination. Still, I feel I'm on the right track.
- 26th April     2008: MooglyGuy - I found that the N64 silently treats such textures as 4-bit Color Indexed (palettized) or 8-bit Color Indexed. In addition, the current RDP implementation in MESS fails to emulate the fact that a 4-bit CI texture can select which of 16 different palettes to use; it's hard-coded to index 0. After fixing this functionality, Madden 64 was fixed.
- 20th April     2008: MooglyGuy - Two-cycle texture lookups are completely wrong in MESS. Big shock, right? The whole principle behind two-cycle texturing is that you can look up texels from independent textures in order to do clever things like masking, or not having to upload textures quite as often (upload two textures one time, then just change the combiner mode to switch textures). With the current implementation, we just copy the value of texel0 into texel1. Yeah, that's kind of wrong. I fixed it. This gets us from the current jumbled mish-mash for menu backgrounds in Paper Mario.
- 13th April     2008: MooglyGuy - I decided to look into yet another long-standing bug in MESS's RDP emulation, which is that two-cycle blending is, in a word, screwed up. Two things are wrong with the current implementation: First, two-cycle blending simply takes the output of the second color-combiner cycle as the blended color and calls it a night. This is because of numerous blending issues caused by not having that hack in there. However, it would appear that the majority of the aforementioned issues are caused by the fact that the "inverse pixel alpha" blender input is not quite so. In fact, the inverse-alpha blender input is the inverse of the A-line multiplexer. It is not a constant inverse of the color combiner alpha, as once thought. With that fixed, a number of other things fall in line, including: Ships, planets and asteroids in Asteroids Hyper 64 are no longer overly dark. The UI in Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. is no longer almost entirely black, and there aren't characters that randomly have black polygons. Clouds are no longer white blocks in the background of Dr. Mario 64's main menu...
- 11th April     2008: MooglyGuy - Rejection Correction: A number of months ago I submitted what I thought was a fix for alpha rejection. In case you're unfamiliar with it, MESS currently has issues with textures that are bordered with an alpha of zero - the completely transparent pixels still write to the Z buffer. The end result can be seen the most readily in Mario Kart 64, where all of the karts have a box around them that obscures karts in front of them. As you can see, it's impossible to see the karts in front of Yoshi despite the fact that you should be able to. This is because Yoshi's sprite is drawn first, and even the transparent pixels surrounding the sprite write to the Z buffer. The end result is that when the game attempts to draw a sprite that's farther out in front of Yoshi's sprite, the pixels are Z-rejected when they should be visible without issue. My original fix was to reject pixels if the color-combined color had an alpha of zero, but unfortunately this caused issues in a number of other games. As it turns out, the N64 rejects pixels that have an alpha of zero when the texel itself is fetched, before any color combine or blend operations even take place. With that in, things look much better.
-  9th April     2008: MooglyGuy - I tacked Z-buffer viewing onto the PIN64 Viewer. It shows what I'd already guessed, which is that the N64 has some way of aborting Z-buffer writes for texels that have an alpha of 0. However, it also shows something that I wasn't expecting, which was that the N64 seems to have a different Z-buffer format than what we're emulating. It would appear that Z values are biased upwards as they get further away from the far plane - note the shift towards red at the end of the track on real hardware versus green in MESS. I'm not quite sure what this ultimately means, as MESS currently writes the Z value of a pixel into the Z buffer, which is what would make the most sense for a real N64 as well. Oh well, once I can hand-construct commands, it shouldn't be too difficult to figure out. The RDP can be coaxed into drawing a trapezoid with a single triangle command if you pass in degenerate Middle-X-Start and High-X-Start values (click for big). It's kind of hard to see, but that little red blob has four sides. Fun!
-  8th April     2008: MooglyGuy - In renderer news, it would appear that I've found the source of the cracks between triangles in MESS. Anyone who has attempted to run Mario Kart 64 in MESS has noticed the seams that are present in almost every scene. The reason for this behavior is that the software rasterizer originally written by Ville Linde (currently MIA) does not handle fractional coordinates. At all. The end result of this is that triangles have their Y coordinates "snapped" to a full-pixel boundary, while the X coordinates remain the same, resulting in uneven boundaries between triangles that would otherwise be aligned. This can only happen because of the funky way in which the N64 stores its coordinates. As opposed to virtually any rational system such as the Playstation or any modern 3D hardware, the N64 specifies its vertices in low edge / middle edge / high edge / slope form. This was clearly done to save processing time, as the edge-walking hardware on the RDP can take in the data virtually unmodified, but it can easily cause rasterization glitches if a person isn't careful. The RDP's edge-walking hardware very likely operates in the following sequence: 1. Load High-X and Middle-X into XLeft and XRight, 2. Load High-Slope and Middle-Slope into StepLeft and StepRight, 3. Load High-Y into Y index, 4. Rasterize 0.25-pixel scanline from XLeft to XRight, 5. Add 0.25*StepLeft to XLeft, 6. Add 0.25*StepRight to XEnd, 7. Increment Y index by 0.25, 8. If Y is less than Middle-Y, go to Step 4, 9. Load Low-X into XRight, 10. Load Low-Slope into StepRight, 11. Rasterize 0.25-pixel scanline from XLeft to XRight, 12. Add 0.25*StepLeft to XLeft, 13. Add 0.25*StepRight to XEnd, 14. Increment Y index by 0.25, 15. If Y is less than Low-Y, go to Step 11 and 16. Done. It's a fairly long list of steps, but it's also fairly simple. Pretty much any software rasterizer functions that way, it usually translates X/Y triplets into that format. With a quick-and-dirty fix that is going to need some massaging to get into a state that can be submitted, we now get these pretty screenshots. If you look closely, you'll notice that alpha-blended triangles are overly "bold". This is an outgrowth of the fact that each scanline is redrawn up to four times. A proper fix for this will be to emulate coverage, which is a bit of a daunting task.
-  7th April     2008: MooglyGuy - Thanks to a few additions to the PIN64 Viewer, I've achieved a considerable speedup. The new additions are: * Moving texture descriptors out of cartridge space and into RAM, * Transferring textures using Cart -> RAM DMA rather than memcpy and * Not flushing the data cache after the texture data copy (it was redundant once memcpy went away). Rendering a frame of Mario Kart 64 now takes less than one second rather than anywhere from 5 to 10. With this in mind, I've managed to narrow down the source of the geometry corruption, though I haven't quite found the cause. For some as-yet unknown reason, sometimes a triangle command will cause the triangle before it to become corrupt. No idea why. Observe (all images link to larger versions). Ultimately, I'm not sure what's causing this. The relevant textures are all the same, so it can't be the texture cache being overwritten. The data itself is not changing, so that's not it. It's not a matter of flushing the command data, as that's already being flushed out of the cache. Weirder still, it would appear that direct framebuffer writes can go a bit wonky when they're done after the RDP is finished with its own rendering. Eagle-eyed readers will notice some of the tiles of the TLUT - all of which are supposed to be precisely 8x8 pixels, which I'm manually rendering by writing to the framebuffer - are running into their neighboring areas, and are sometimes being overwritten by neighboring areas. Funky! I have no idea what's causing this, possibly something to do with coverage, possibly not.
-  6th April     2008: MooglyGuy - I've finally managed to get my N64 development environment up and working again. Apparently the time off did my mind some good, as within about an hour and a half I fixed the texture byteswapping issue that had me stumped for several weeks. Previously, text at the top and bottom of the screen was corrupt in the race introduction sequence in Mario Kart 64, and there was significant graphical corruption in Dr. Mario 64's main menu to the point of causing a system hang when run on real hardware. With proper byteswapping, we now get. Eagle-eyed readers will notice that there are some geometry issues in Mario Kart 64. I'm not quite sure what's causing that, as the rest of the scene geometry is largely unaffected. I'll have to look into it once I've optimized the viewer - rendering a capture takes upwards of 5 to 10 seconds, so it's impractical to page through a capture's commands in order to isolate the ones with issues. In other news, Adam Gashlin (hcs, of Neon64 and USF fame) has managed to mostly fix N64 audio output in MESS. There appears to be some sort of issue with the DMA DAC audio device in MAME / MESS, however, as the stream written by -wavwrite shows odd glitches that aren't present if the raw audio stream is dumped out to a file. That's been submitted to MAME along with a DMA fix by Ville Linde. Edit: As there seems to be some confusion, the above screenshots are of the PIN64 Viewer running on a real N64, taken with a video capture card. I'm sick of having to buy a new 4-pack of AA batteries nearly every week for my crappy digital camera, so this is going to be the new means of taking real-hardware screenshots going forward.
-  5th March     2008: MooglyGuy - A couple bits of miscellany: TLUT (Texel Look-Up Table) viewing support, an update to my frame-merge tool, pin64merge, to support my most recent modifications to the capture format, and a minor PIN64 Viewer bugfix. Yes, the PIN64 Player still has some texture issues to work out, which will pretty much be my text task.
-  7th January   2008: MooglyGuy - ColourBorrower showed me them. In case anyone feels like comparing against reference material, the good ColourBorrower provided me with a link to various Pokemon Puzzle League videos, found here. The strange corruption in the collage on 1/6/2008, "My Pokemans", seems to be caused when the game attempts to draw the borders around the playfield and meters. Now I just need to figure out why. In other news, Ziggy's Z64 plugin is great, I'm sure, but it rewrites a fairly substantial amount of MESS's RDP functionality in order to get hardware acceleration working. I can't make heads or tails of what the changes were under the hood versus MESS's behavior, so I've put in a request for the man to summarize the changes he made. Here's hoping it works. Looks like we've got a bit of work to do. In addition, if it appears that MESS is a bit darker than my TV, it's because it is; not because my TV is increasing the gamma level, but because gamma correction is turned on in the VI by default and MESS doesn't emulate it.
-  6th January   2008: MooglyGuy - I finally got into the swing of writing test code for the N64 again, and decided to tackle the fact that the behavior of DMA transfers when the Count and Skip fields were non-zero was unknown. A couple hours later, I have a fix for almost any game in MESS that previously died with a non-zero dma_count or dma_skip assertion. Wonder of wonders, Pokemon Puzzle League now fires right up and is fully playable. Yesterday I fixed texture loading and texel fetching for 32-bit RGBA textures, which fixes Mario Kart 64's title logo. Last but not least, I was able to reenable texture clamping. It was previously disabled because enabling it broke Rampage: World Tour, but it was able to be reenabled once I discovered the reason. If you're curious, apparently texture coordinates should be recentered on 0,0 for the sake of texel lookup after coordinate clamping and mirroring, not before.
- 29th December  2007: MooglyGuy - (2) I know that there's something wrong with the way MESS handles edges. But nobody can give me a clear, plain English answer as to WHAT is wrong. All I've been able to gather is that inconsistencies and inaccuracies are creeping in due to the fact that when it comes to X coordinates, MESS performs a wholesale truncation of Everyone who has an inkling as to what is wrong seems insistent on describing it in the most arcane methods possible, and when I ask for a more concise summary as to what's wrong, I'm given a link that attempts to describe polygon edge rasterization in an even more crepuscular manner than to what I'm already being subjected. That's not to sound ungrateful for the help that people have tried to provide, it's just that as yet I've failed to understand any explanations given. I know that the problem is the truncation that MESS performs; in MESS, if X is 0.0 to 0.9999, it's truncated to 0, 1.0 -> 1.9999 = 1, 2.0 -> 2.9999 = 2, and so on. But... how's it supposed to be? 0.0 -> 0.4999 = 0, 0.5 -> 1.4999 = 1, and so on? Or what? Just saying that the Nintendo 64 handles coordinates with quarter-pixel accuracy doesn't help me at all, I need to know how to go from those fixed-point values to integer values so that I can actually draw pixels into the framebuffer! After all, it's not like the Nintendo 64 has some huge internal framebuffer that renders at four times the X and Y resolution and then downsamples when storing it to RAM, there's obviously some very simple rounding that it performs in order to obtain whole pixels plus a given coverage (CVG) value. Everyone has yet to tell me what the form is that that rounding takes. RDP is similar to OpenGL? Okay, but that doesn't quite help, the OpenGL spec is huge and I don't know where to begin looking! Argh! The only person who reasonably COULD figure out what is wrong is addicted to WoW, and I don't see that changing anytime soon.
- 29th December  2007: MooglyGuy - Triangles (Even Pink Ones): Today was a pretty productive day, adding support for the following commands: Triangle (all modes), Set Scissor, Set Fill Color, Set Fog Color, Set Blend Color and Set Env. Color. With the triangle and color editing, we can send Mario on our very own LSD trip. he Set Scissor command, as the name implies, affects the scissor box for polygon drawing. The remaining commands that I need to support are as follows: Set Key GB, Set Key R, Set Convert, Set Prim Depth, Set Other Modes, Load TLUT, Set Tile Size, Load Block, Load Tile, Set Tile, Fill Rectangle, Set Prim Color, Set Texture Image, Set Z Image and Set Color Image. Some of these probably don't actually need to be edited - for instance, I hear that color keying is actually broken in production N64 units. Who knew?
- 28th December  2007: MooglyGuy - Hack 'n Slash: Well, that ended up being a lot easier than I thought it would be, though I'm not 100% sure it's accurate to the hardware. I put in a specific check to disable writing the pixel to the framebuffer and Z-buffer if the alpha of the pixel, post-color-combine, is zero. Surprisingly, it didn't seem to adversely affect things.
- 27th December  2007: MooglyGuy - The Freeman's Nemesis: The first command-editing screen is now in, it allows you to edit the "Set Combine" command. To do so, I had to create a new part, the UIDropdown class. When you have a Set Combine command selected in the main event list, pressing 'E' will bring up the command edtior screen for the command, if one is relevant. Once you press 'D' (Done) the editor screen will go away and return you to the main event list. As a demonstration, I edited most of the Set Combine events to use the following equation for texture color: ( C_ZERO - C_ZERO ) * C_ZERO + C_TEX0. Which results in the following scene (see screenshot). Update: Now we go into the realm of 2D, with the ability to edit Textured Rectangle commands. After some jiggery-pokery to support non-fullsreen UIScreen instances, we have a handy editor for the aforementioned commands: After some fooling around, we can enhance Super Mario 64 for the visually impaired! Not sure what command I'm going to support next. Update (2): Curse the N64. Damn the N64 to hell. I'm inches away from just throwing in the towel. I took a break from PIN64 to try to track down a genuine rendering bug, which is that textures with an alpha border always write to Z, even when fully transparent. For a real example of this, look at the screenshot I posted in "Retro-Active" with the trees in it; you can see that the upper-left tree has a border of transparent pixels around it, and you can actually see the castle through the tree behind it. This is caused by the fact that the frontmost tree is drawn before the rearmost tree, but the tree's entire triangles write to the Z buffer, rather than just the opaque pixels. Thus when the tree behind the frontmost tree is drawn, pixels that should appear do not, as there's an invisible border out to the edges of the frontmost tree's triangles that's written into the Z-buffer. Normally, 3D hardware provides a facility called an "alpha compare" function, which will selectively reject pixels as they're being rendered if their alpha values fall below a given threshold value. In fact, the N64 provides just such a feature. The problem? The Set Other Modes command that comes down the pipe most recently before the trees does not, in fact, enable alpha comparison. I've yet to figure out how the hell, then, the N64 knows to reject the relevant pixels and prevent them from writing to the Z buffer. What's annoying me so much, though, is the fact that everyone seems convinced that it should be really easy to track down, but nobody has offered any convincing explanations as to why it happens.
- 24th December  2007: MooglyGuy - Differently Abled: I've put the ability to disable events in PIN64. Observe the scene with the water polys enabled in Mario64. Update: I've added another UIList to the upper-right pane in the window so that you can see additional info on the command that you have selected. In doing so, PIN64 has made its first true step towards usefulness. For instance, it seemed to me that the bottom face of the first billboard you encounter in Mario 64 was being drawn incorrectly. Now that I have the ability to get a proper interactive view of the commands being sent to the RDP, I can see that the errant drawing is not due to an RDP implementaton bug, but is in fact probably due to an RSP core bug.
- 19th December  2007: MooglyGuy - I've brought the PIN64 UITextQueue class up to date, and am now keeping a list of the events that are queued.
- 16th December  2007: MooglyGuy - PEBKAC: Over the past two weeks I've been overhauling PIN64 under the hood to use proper classes and singletons rather than make everything an ungodly mess of global functions and typedefs. I've done a first pass at converting the UI system found in NUTS - I now have the UITextField class converted over and I've created a new UIRect class to encapsulate colored tiles of arbitrary size in order to get filled window backgrounds and such. It's very rudimentary, but the following demonstrates one UIRect instance and two UITextField instances contained within a single UIScreen instance inside the UI singleton. Also note that I've added the ability to highlight the currently-selected triangle event with a white line around the edges.
- 29th November  2007: MooglyGuy - Making A Pass: I've nearly perfected texture support in PIN64. I had a lingering issue that I didn't figure out until this evening, which is that some captures seemed to be lacking around half the polygons that should have been there. It wasn't until I considered the relative lack of power that the N64 has that it dawned on me: Most N64 games do not, in fact, run at 60 frames per second. With that in mind, I added a #define to my output routines in MESS to output five sequential frames' worth of captures to separately-named files. My hunch was right, and it turns out that a number of games draw half of the geometry in one pass, then the rest of the geometry in a second. I threw together a program to merge together two or more individual frame captures, and lo and behold, it worked perfectly. What follows is a series of screenshots from my current working version. I've also implemented the ability to cycle the event display index. This is the same capture as the merged in-game captures, but with the event display index set to stop halfway through rendering the castle. The next step for PIN64 is to give it some sort of keyboard-controlled user interface for viewing the current state of registers, and possibly manually modifying registers. In addition, I plan to add playback support on real hardware.
- 25th November  2007: MooglyGuy - While NUTS provides a reasonably decent method for detecting errors in MESS's RSP implementation, there's currently no good way to test the RDP implementation. Certainly, NUTS has a rudimentary method for sending packets to the RDP manually, but there's no in-depth tool. With that in mind, I'm now working on a program tentatively called PIN64 - Polygon Inspector for N64. The current plan is to add functionality to MESS that will allow the user to capture all of the commands sent to the RDP over the course of a given frame, then load that capture in a separate program in order to externally analyze the RDP behavior. The analysis tool will allow the user to see a rendering of all or some of the packets sent to the RDP over the course of the frame, view the state of the RDP after each packet, and possibly modify the RDP state somewhat as well. This has the distinct advantage of being able to capture a single frame from MESS, then iterate on MESS's RDP emulation without having to re-run the game each time. Yesterday and today I threw together some initial work. PIN64, in its current state, can either dump the command stream as text or render the command stream on-screen. As I have not yet added support to MESS for saving the textures when they're loaded, the captures lack textures. Nonetheless, it's working decently thus far (see screenshots).
- NOTES: The SGI/Nintendo Reality Display Processor (RDP) handles most - not all - graphical capabilities for the Nintendo 64 (more on that in a moment). It pulls 64-bit-wide command packets from either RDRAM or RSP DMEM depending on a bit in its status register. Command packets can range from a single 64-bit word (Full Sync, Sync Pipe, Set Color Image, Load TLUT, et cetera) to 22 words (Triangle with Gouraud, Texture and Z-Buffering). While it is not as fast in terms of fill rate as the Playstation 1's GPU, it makes up for it in feature richness. It supports significantly more texture formats than either the Sega Saturn (which is ostensibly not a 3D system, anyway) or the Playstation, including YUV16, Intensity (grayscale texture tinted by a specified primitive color, useful for particle effects) and Intensity with Alpha. It features a four-parameter color combiner which implements the equation (A - B) * C + D separately for both RGB and Alpha, as well as four-parameter blending with optional two-cycle mode (with the expected throughput penalty, of course); in fact, the Color Combiner is sufficiently advanced that outside of software rasterization, one needs full pixel shader support in order to fully emulate its features. The RDP's framebuffer and Z buffer are stored directly in RDRAM.

12.2   ADSP21xx

- 0.154              : Converted ADSP21xx to DEVCB2 [Osso].
- 0.141u4            : Christophe Jaillet fixed long-standing bug in ABS flags in ADSP21xx core.
- 0.139u3            : Aaron Giles converted ADSP21xx core to a modern CPU device.
- 0.128u7            : Aaron Giles changed ADSP21xx cores to accept a configuration struct instead of using set_info to specify serial port callbacks. Simplified the ADSP21xx get/set info significantly. Removed support for only including certain variants of the chips; they are now either all supported or all unsupported. Aaron Giles added the concept of a cpu_state_table, which is supplied by the CPU cores and which describes all the register state accessible to the debugger and other subsystems. The format of the table is such that most data can be simply fetched from memory without the further involvement of the CPU core, including the display of common formats. Extensibility points are available for custom display and for importing/exporting the data to intermediate variables for more complicated scenarios. Updated the ADSP21xx core to use this.
- 0.128u6            : Aaron Giles added wrappers for ADSP21xx callbacks. Added device parameters to them. Updated IRQ setters to use generic_pulse_irq_line().
- 0.128u4            : Switched ADSP21xx to new memory functions [Couriersud].
- 0.109u5            : Aaron Giles converted the ADSP21xx disassemblers to the new format and added step in/out support where it was obvious.
- 0.104u1            : Buddabing added save state support to the ADSP-21xx CPUs core.
- 0.103u3            : Aaron Giles added timer support to the ADSP cores and hooked it up for the DCS games.
- 0.78u4             : CPUs with an implicit address shift (e.g., the TMS34010 shifts addresses right 3 bits; the TMS32031 shifts addresses left 2 bits) now automatically get that shift applied to addresses in their memory maps and in calls to install_memory_read/write_handler(). This eliminates many ugly macros in the memory maps. Affected CPU cores are the ADSP210x, CCPU, PIC16C5x, TMS3201x, TMS3202x, TMS32031, and TMS340x0. Note that the CPU cores themselves still need to pass shifted values to the core read/write routines. All drivers using these cores have had their icky macros and bitshifts removed. * Harvard architecture CPUs now have data memory fully implemented now. Affected CPUs are the ADSP210x, TMS3201x, TMS3202x, PIC16C5x, and CCPU. All cores have been modified to fully split program and data memory. All drivers using these cores now specify explicit program and data memory maps. This also gets rid of a ton of ugly macros used in memory maps [Aaron Giles].

Simplified Last Bronx fix, however it's confirmed to set dst address to 0, Ville? Added ALU opcode 0x89 (FAVG), Last Bronx shows background scene in attract then asserts [Angelo Salese]. Initialize DMA6 registers in host booting mode (cpu\sharc\sharc.c). DMA internal index registers are only 17 bits long [Ville Linde].
- 0.153              : Changed cpu\sharc\compute.c to compute.inc, sharcdma.c to sharcdma.inc, sharcmem.c to sharcmem.inc and sharcops.c to sharcops.inc [Oliver Stöneberg]. Modernized SHARC cpu core [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.148u1            : SHARC Disassembler update (cpu\sharc\sharcdsm.c) [Pavel Semerad]: Added omitted direction flags in instruction using both PM() and DM(). In instruction with 6bit immediate data, this data is signed value. It would be better to show this sign because it is confusing to see for example 0x3F which actually means -1 (32bit immed data are not confusing as that big values are easy to recognize).
- 0.147              : Minor optimizations (cpu\sharc\sharc.c and cpu\sharc\sharcops.c). Changed delayed IOP writes to use timers (cpu\sharc\sharc.c). Rewroted DMA handling to use timers [Ville Linde].
- 0.143u3            : Fixed SHARC CPU in UNIDASM [trap15].

- 0.125u7            : Aaron Giles added save state support to the SHARC CPU core.
-  8th April     2007: Ville Linde - I fixed some multi-processor issues in the SHARC core, and some Voodoo-related issues in the NWK-TR/Hang Pilot graphics board emulation. As a result, Hang Pilot sprung to life in its whole 3D glory. There seems to be some texture problems still to be fixed though.
-  5th April     2007: Ville Linde - Racing Jam and Hang Pilot are finally starting to show something. I had to force the SHARC not to execute the display list because of some weird bugs, so no 3D graphics yet.
- 0.113u3            : Ville Linde fixed several SHARC opcodes where data transfer was done regardless of the condition. This fixes many things, like the upside-down geometry in Model 2B games. And also, probably all the remaining clipping issues in Gradius 4. At least the planet zooming out in the intro works now. Fixed an interrupt delay slot problem in the SHARC core.
- 18th March     2007: Ville Linde - I was finally able to find and fix the SHARC bugs that were causing Solar Assault and GTI Club to crash. After that I went to improve the Konami 3D graphics chip emulation. Now both games are starting look quite good. Neither game is playable yet, though. Solar Assault is currenly missing the analog controls, and GTI Club still has some problems with the network chip.
- 0.109u5            : Aaron Giles converted the sharc disassemblers to the new format and added step in/out support where it was obvious.
- 0.109u3            : Removed cpu\sharc\sharcdtb.c. Added cpu\sharc\sharcdma.c and sharcmem.c. Major rewrite of the SHARC core [Ville Linde]: Bit-accurate reciprocals. More accurate pipeline emulation. Fixed the problems with operation latencies. Regression tested a few floating-point operations for bit-accurate results. Improved DMA emulation. This update will fix most (but not all) of the clipping problems in Gradius 4 and NBA Play by Play.

- 0.102              : Many fixes to the SHARC core and Konami PPC drivers [Ville Linde].
-  9th November  2005: Ville Linde - Fixed a DMA latency issue in the SHARC core. The graphics problems in Gradius 4 are now fixed.
-  7th November  2005: Ville Linde - Fixed another bunch of SHARC bugs and added a few more opcodes. Most of the missing graphics are now showing in Gradius 4, but they are still rather broken, probably due to some more SHARC bugs.
- 30th October   2005: Ville Linde - I've continued to add features and fix bugs in the SHARC core. Now the SHARC is sending the first triangle commands to the Voodoo. For now it's limited to some non-textured triangles in the color test screen and the stars in the background of the first level.
- 24th October   2005: Ville Linde - Fixed some stupid mistakes and added a few more SHARC opcodes and now Gradius 4 gets ingame. Most of the graphics are still missing as they are done with the 3dfx chips.
- 0.99u2             : SHARC/Model 2 updates [Ville Linde]: Reworked the SHARC internal ram implementation so that multiple instances of the core work. Added data address space. Added coprocessor input and output FIFO's to Model 2. Updated Konami zr107, gticlub, nwk-tr, hornet to work with the SHARC changes.
- 0.97u2             : Improvements to the SHARC CPU core [Ville Linde]: Correct IRQ handling. Added many more opcodes, including floating-point.
- 0.97u1             : Added cpu\sharc\sharc.c/h, sharcdsm.c/h, sharcdtb.c, sharcops.c/h and compute.c. Ville Linde added ADSP-21062 core and partially hooked it up for the Model 2B games and Konami PowerPC based 3D games.
- 25th May       2005: Ville Linde - I've continued my progress on my Analog Devices ADSP-2106x SHARC core. The results are finally starting to show. Gradius IV already passes all of its bootup tests. The 3Dfx chips have also been hooked up already. Unfortunately the game is protected, like all the other Hornet games. Silent Scope currently passes all the tests on the first graphics board. The second board isn't emulated yet. Midnight Run and GTI Club pass all the tests, except one FIFO test, which fails on both boards.

Spent most of the day (many hours) trying to work out why this was hanging with my changes only to find out the 68k change broke the driver (it's still broken, i don't have time to fix it). csplayh5.c, kenseim.c, nbmj9195 and niyanpai.c now uses the TMPZ84C011 core with callbacks. Moved tmpz84c011 specifics to its own files, make z80ctc a subdevice rather than adding it separately it in each driver using a tmpz84c011 [David Haywood]. Small cleanup. NOTE: If you want a handler for logging unmapped read/write, put it in the driver machine config, like we do with 8255, for example: MCFG_I8255_OUT_PORTB_CB(LOGGER("PPI8255 - unmapped write port B", 0)). Got rid of TMPZ84C011_Z80CTC trampolines. Daisy chain config is on TMPZ84C011 external pins. Made TMPZ84C011 pins external instead of making drivers having to interface with its internal peripherals. Looks like unmapped output bits are 0 [hap].

- 10th December  2006: Luca Elia - More TLCS-90 games work: A few more games powered by the TMP91C640 CPU now work, like the much requested Mahjong Tenkaigen. These screenshots are actually from one of several bootlegs that where dumped, the original is protected and does not work yet. Another one running on pretty much the same hardware, dynax.c, is Mahjong Reach. This is a bootleg as well, and the only dumped version.
-  3rd December  2006: Luca Elia - I've emulated the TMP90C840/TMP91C640 microcontrollers, some of the few CPU's still unsupported in MAME. They belong to the TLCS-90 family, introduced by Toshiba in the early nineties, the ancestor of the TLCS-900 that powers the Neo Geo Pocket. This 8-bit CPU is essentially a Z80 on steroids: different binary encoding, 20 bit address bus, more opcodes and addressing modes, interrupt controller, 6 timers, A/D conversion, serial interface, 53 I/O lines, 48 internal registers plus optional internal RAM and ROM. The TMP90C841 (ROM-less '840), with external program rom, drives the music in Rapid Hero, which is no longer silent. The TMP91C640 was used in a number of Dynax mahjong games of that era, like Mahjong If (1990) and Mahjong Tensinhai (1995). There are a couple more mahjong games for which the internal rom has been dumped, through an expensive adapter, that I'm now working on, as well as a few bugs to fix before I'm done with this.

- 0.150              : Changed name 'TLCS-900/H' to 'TMP95C063'. Modernized TLCS-900 cpu core [Wilbert Pol]. Moved the I/O handling into it's own class & hooked up TO1/TO3 to output on Port A. A hack is needed because ngpc doesn't set PACR/PAFC, which may be because it's a custom part. Changed Taito PJC driver (Operation Tiger) to use TMP95C063 CPU. Separated I/O Ports on both CPU's so you can apply the DEVCB2 callbacks individually. Added 8/16 bit data bus configuration to TLCS900H. Default is 16bit, (MESS) NeoGeo Pocket is 8 bit [smf].

15.    MIPS CPUs

- 0.184              : Retry fixing FPU register aliasing (mips\mips3.cpp and mips3drc.cpp). This fixed 3D graphic objects in Hyperdrive. Make sure branch delay slot instruction is not virtual instruction before trying to generate code to add it to the block checksum (mips\mips3drc.cpp) [Happy].
- 0.180              : Moved the declaration for dasmmips3() to a header file. Changed the MIPS3 disassembler to use 'std::ostream &' internally [Nathan Woods].
- 0.179              : Fixed disassembly window [smf].
- 0.175              : Updated rom naming/mapping and changed ram instantiation (mips\mips3drc.cpp and machine\vrc4373.cpp) [Ted Green].

- 0.155              : Throw badcop exceptions on COP1 accesses while the COP1 status bit is not enabled (mips\mips3drc.c) [MarathonMan]. Made badcop exception handling cleaner [MooglyGuy].
- 0.154              : The official MIPS ABI doesn't have $ in front of the software names for the integer registers http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/devel/assembly/007-2816-005.pdf & the debugger thinks you're entering a hex number when you're trying to use them. I've left the disassembler, but the official ABI doesn't use them in source either (the only supporting evidence I found for them is the Linux ABI). I also removed the space padding which hasn't had the intended effect since the new debugger was introduced [smf]. Modernised MIPS3 cpu core [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.152              : Made dismips build again, need to move functionality to UNIDASM (cpu\psx\dismips.c and dismips.mak) [smf].
- 0.150              : Made both DRC and Non-DRC compile for MIPS, RSP and SH2 core and added option to enable/disable DRC from command line (-drc -nodrc by default it's on). Added command line option to force DRC C backend (emu\emuopts.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.148u1            : Added direct dynamic entry load to virtual TLB (cpu\vtlb.c). vtlb_fill doesn't appear to provide an easy way to determine whether a failure is due to a presence or permission error also entries need to be marked dirty or the performance improvement is minimal [Carl].
- 0.147u2            : hap fixed compile on mips3 C core.
- 0.145u2            : Checksum the delay slot in single-instruction blocks in the MIPS3 and RSP DRCs [Ryan Holtz].
- 0.141u1            : Make MIPS DRC selectable by #ifdef [R. Belmont]. MooglyGuy fixed BADCOP exception handling in the MIPS III interpreter. Harmony fixed Compare interrupts in the MIPS III interpreter core. Aleck 64 games can now run under the MIPS III interpreter. Implemented proper TLB handling in the MIPS III interpreter. Aaron Giles fixed MIPS3 DRC case where branch delay slot straddles a page boundary and the page check confirms that the block is paged in. Include MIPS3 DRC delay slots in checksum calculations. Simplified UML parameters, as follows [Aaron Giles]: Immediates can be passed raw, no IMM() wrapper required (and it's gone now). Fixed integer registers now use constants I0,I1,I2,etc instead of IREG(0),... Same for float registers F0,F1,F2,etc instead of FREG(0). Dynamic integer/float regs use inline functions ireg(),freg(). MEM macro is now a lower-case inline function mem().
- 0.141              : MooglyGuy fixed writes in the MIPS III interpreter.
- 0.135u4            : Aaron Giles enhanced the UML opcodes for LOAD, LOADS and STORE to support arbitrary scaling factors. Previously, specifying a size implied a scaling factor equal to the size (i.e., specifying DWORD meant the index was scaled by 4). This is still the default. However, now you can specify the scale explicitly for other cases. For example, you can specify DWORD_x1 to fetch a DWORD but don't scale the index at all, or BYTE_x8 to fetch a BYTE while scaling the index by 8. Updated all backends to make this work.
- 0.135u1            : MIPS3 TLB fixes [Aaron Giles]: Now properly generating TLB fill exceptions under correct circumstances. TLB exceptions no longer trash low 4 bits of Context. Exceptions with the EXL bit set always go to vector 0x180. Fixed bug in vtlb code that caused us to lose track of previously registered fixed page ranges. Fixed MIPS3 behavior that would not clear out invalid page ranges from the VTLB under certain circumstances. Added support for TLB sizes less than 48 entries. Fixed TLBMOD exceptions so they also properly set BadVAddr.
- 0.133u5            : Harmony enabled alternate register naming in the MIPS core.
- 0.130u1            : Update RA in MIPS III before executing the delay slot [R. Belmont].

- 0.125u9            : MIPS3 recompiler [Aaron Giles]: Don't generate compare interrupts unless the compare register was written to; fixes hangs in blitz, calspeed and others. Stash jump target address before executing delay slot; also, don't update link register until delay slot has finished executing; fixes hang in gauntleg. Marked IDT instructions for R4650 only. Accounted for time taken in throwaway likely branch slots. Fixed jalr to respect the correct link register. Fixed c.eq, c.lt, c.le to fail if unordered. Fixed swxc1, sdxc1 to use the correct source register  (fixes many Gauntlet problems). Fixed CCR31 display in debugger. Fixed LWXC1/LDXC1; corrects gauntleg camera.
- 0.125u7            : Aaron Giles added save state support to the MIPS3 recompiler and virtual TLB system. Atari Ace corrected the dependencies for the MIPS core.

Implemented LL/LLD/SC/SCD (only works single-processor for now). Created common virtual TLB managment module. Updated MIPS and PowerPC code to make use of it [Aaron Giles].
- 0.125u5            : MIPS recompiler update [Aaron Giles]: Updated to no longer explicitly specify flags. Tweaked register tracking to match new DRC frontend system. Updated UML logging to output new frontend statistics. Fixed left/right accesses to work with recent memory handler changes.
- 0.125u4            : Removed cpu\x86drc.c/h and x64drc.c/h. MIPS3 dynamic recompiler [Aaron Giles]: Fixed Cause register for bad COP instructions. Updated to use new/changed opcode forms. Changed context switch so that it only swaps a single pointer.
- 0.125u3            : MIPS core changes [Aaron Giles]: Renamed struct mips3_config -> mips3_config. Updated all drivers to the new names. Removed MIPS3DRC_STRICT_COP0 flag, which is no longer used. A few minor cleanups. Moved implementation-specific state into a pointer hanging off of the core MIPS3 state. Removed large context in favor of a pointer to the large context to help improve context switch times.
- 0.125u1            : Removed cpu\mips\mdrc64.c and mdrcold.c.
- 0.124u4            : Aaron Giles inverted the sense of the memory mask that is passed to read/write handlers. Previously, the mask indicated which bits were NOT requested to be read/written. Now, the mask indicates which bits ARE to be read/written, which is more logical. Updated a number of drivers and the MIPS CPU cores to comply.
- 0.122u5            : Aaron Giles fixed bug where the 64-bit DRC was not saving rbp.
- 0.119u4            : Aaron Giles fixed 64-bit DRC bug that broke kinst in the previous release. Aaron Giles added code to detect potential hotspots in the 64-bit DRC. Added hotspots to all the seattle.c games and several of the vegas.c games.
- 0.119u3            : Aaron Giles fixed several more bugs in the 64-bit MIPS recompiler. It is now capable of running the Seattle games and the 3D Gauntlets.
- 0.119u2            : Added cpu\drcfe.c/h. Aaron Giles fixed MIPS3 disassembly of j/jal instructions. Aaron Giles created new generic x86/x64 logging system x86log, and updated both MIPS3 DRC cores to use it. Aaron Giles created new generic DRC frontend management. Future work involves retooling the MIPS3 frontend around this new architecture. Aaron Giles switched MIPS3 64-bit DRC over to new system that is more aggressive about register allocation and mapping. Sadly, there is little to no obvious performance benefit, but the resulting code is better organized. Aaron Giles created new generic x86/x64 logging system x86log, and updated both MIPS3 DRC cores to use it. Aaron Giles created new generic DRC frontend management. Future work involves retooling the MIPS3 frontend around this new architecture.
- 0.119u1            : Added cpu\mips\mdrc64.c, mips3fe.c/h and cpu\x64drc.c/h. Aaron Giles added preliminary attempt at a new x64 dynamic recompiler for the MIPS 3/4 CPUs. The current version works enough to run a few basic games (kinst, carnevil), but many others fail. Furthermore, this version is already being supplanted by a more advanced version that does register allocation and constant folding. For now it is disabled by default. Aaron Giles fixed several 64-bit errors in the code generators in x86emit.h.
- 0.118u6            : Aaron Giles made a cleanup pass through the new x86emit.h code emitters, changing the way memory is referenced and replacing macros with inline functions. Updated MIPS and PowerPC drc cores to use the new emitters. Removed the old macro-based ones in x86drc.h.
- 0.118u4            : Aaron Giles added new functions to the memory system to support CPU cores explicitly specifying the access mask on 32-bit and 64-bit data bus systems. This enables the MIPS core to handle SWL/SWR and SDL/SDR without a read/modify/write cycle. Updated the C and DRC MIPS cores to use this new mechanism. Aaron Giles fixed recently introduced bug in the mips3 core that caused the C core to launch off into nowhere after the first instruction.
- 0.118u3            : Added cpu\mips\mips3com.c/h. Aaron Giles consolidated common code between drc and non-drc MIPS cores.
- 0.114u4            : Vas Crabb updated the MIPS3 DRC to align the stack to sixteen-byte boundaries at the point of calls, as required by Mac OS X calling conventions. It doesn't break compatibility with Windows or Linux calling conventions. This fixes crashes in MIPS3 games when running on OS X for Intel.
- 0.104u4            : R. Belmont hooked up the R4650 properly in the MIPS recompiler.
- 0.104u3            : R. Belmont and Aaron Giles added support for IDT-specific MIPS MUL instruction in the MIPS3 core, recompiler and disassembler.
- 0.102u5            : Aaron Giles fixed subtle bug in the MIPS3 recompiler that prevented Tenth Degree from working.
- 21st December  2005: Aaron Giles - Figure out why Tenth Degree no longer worked. It used to, and I was sure it was due to the Voodoo rewrite. I spent quite a bit of time looking into that, assuming I was returning an incorrect value from the status register or something. Turns out I was completely wrong. Instead, an "optimization" I had made to the MIPS dynarec core a while back had a subtle side effect. The problem was literally with the particular opcode: slti r2,r3,$1. In the old dynarec core, that was translated as: mov eax,[r3.lo]; mov edx,[r3.hi]; sub eax,1; sbb edx,0; shr edx,31; mov [r2.hi],0 and mov [r2.lo],edx. The optimization I added was to convert code that subtracted 1 from a register to use the dec opcode instead, since it is more compact. So the new code was: mov eax,[r3.lo]; mov edx,[r3.hi]; dec eax; sbb edx,0; shr edx,31; mov [r2.hi],0 and mov [r2.lo],edx. Which is 4 bytes smaller, taking up less instruction/trace cache space. Multiply this over a lot of generated code and it has an impact. The problem is that dec eax is not quite the same as sub eax,1. Specifically, dec does not set the carry flag, meaning that the sbb instruction that followed would never "borrow" from the high word, messing up the math. So with that, Tenth Degree is working again, and better than ever. One thing I discovered in my recent research is that if certain values (red, green, blue, alpha, Z, and W) overflow during triangle rasterization, they are allowed to wrap in a slightly odd fashion. For example, if the red component increases from $FF to $100 to $101 over the course of several pixels, you would expect it to wrap from $FF to $00 to $01. But the internal microcode in the Voodoo actually checks explicitly for $100 and clamps it to $FF, while allowing $101 to wrap to $01. So what you actually get is a transition from $FF to $FF to $01. Why is this important? Well, let's say you are drawing a triangle such that the leftmost pixel has a red value of 0.0 and the rightmost pixel has a red value of 1.0. Converting these values to integers between 0-255 means the left value is $00 and the right value is $100. If the Voodoo allowed simple wrapping, that last pixel would be drawn as $00, showing up as an ugly black pixel right next to a bright red one. The simple clamping logic allows for a bit of slop of 1 on either the high or low side without producing artifacts. The upshot is that if you run an old build of MAME and look at Tenth Degree, you'll see lots of artifacts - unsightly black or white pixels that shouldn't be there. Implementing this clamping logic turns out to fix these problems. Mace: The Dark Age also suffered from the same problem to a lesser degree. I bet the Tenth Degree engine was based off of the Mace engine.
- 0.102              : Aaron Giles fixed handling of the FR bit in the Status register on MIPS3. This fixes a few problems in CarnEvil, and probably affects a few other games as well. Also fixed bug where TLB exceptions were not filling in the Context and EntryHi registers correctly.
- 0.101u4            : R. Belmont added missing SC/LL opcodes to the MIPS3 interpreter.
- 0.101u3            : Aaron Giles added MMU support to the MIPS3 dynamic recompiler. Re-enabled it by default. Added direct fast RAM access to the dynamic recompiler, as well as optional hotspot optimizations. Most games should show a net speedup over the pre-MMU compiler.
- 0.101u2            : Aaron Giles added MMU support to the non-drc MIPS3 emulator. Converted the Killer Instinct, Seattle, Vegas, and Hyper Neo-Geo 64 drivers to a proper physical memory layout. Disabled the drc MIPS3 core until MMU support is added there as well.
- 0.96u3             : Nathan Woods added better debugging support to the MIPS core.
- 0.96u2             : Nathan Woods modified the MIPS DRC core to disable optimizations when mame_debug is on. This makes it easier to run comparative traces when running both with and without MIPS DRC enabled (cpu\mips\mdrcold.c).
- 0.84u3             : Aaron Giles fixed crash in the MIPS core introduced with the 0.84u2 changes.
- 0.84u2             : Aaron Giles added support for non-integral clock multipliers in the MIPS3 core.
- 0.82u2             : Added cpu\mips\mdrcold.c. Aaron Giles added support for the Config register and for new variants: R4700, QED5271 and RM7000. Fixed bug in LWXC1/LDXC1/SWXC1/SDXC1 instructions. Extracted core codegen portion into new #include file mdrcold.c (mips3drc.c).
-  8th May       2004: Aaron Giles - So I spent about half the week trying to rewrite the MIPS recompiler from scratch, and then remembered what an awful lot of work it was. So I went back to the existing one, which works, and decided to start applying most of the optimizations there. The final result won't be as substantially faster as I would have liked, but I hope I can get a good chunk of the speedups in. So far so good on about half of them, but the most recent one (register allocation of floating point registers and using SSE math throughout) is causing me fits like the off-kilter NFL Blitz image. The games boot now, but their geometry is seriously screwed.
- 28th April     2004: Aaron Giles - I have about 1/4 of the instructions rewritten, as well as the core control flow analysis. I still need to finish up the instructions, write the final register allocator, and then get it working, so I think it will be a few weeks before I have anything to show for it. I'm currently guessing it will be about 2x as efficient as the old one. I'm also restructuring it a bit so that it will be possible to add an x86-64 backend eventually.

- 0.78u2             : Changed name 'R5000' to 'R5000__little_'.
- 19th December  2003: Aaron Giles - Wow, that was a tricky bug. Turns out nobody was ever saving the FPU condition codes in the R5000 core, so if you took an interrupt between a compare and a branch on the result of that compare, you would hose the compare. This led to all kinds of nasty.
- 0.77               : Added seattle.c driver with R5000 CPU1 (144MHz) (blitz99, calspeed, carnevil, mace, sfrush and wg3dh).
- 0.76u2             : Aaron Giles fixed MIPS3 timer handling so we don't set a timer too far in advance and changed timer handling so that the default Compare value doesn't trigger timers, fixed cycle chomping to make sure we don't go over an interrupt boundary, added correct cycle times for MULT/DIV instructions and fixed display of the Count reigster in the debugger. Also added better support for tweaking the X86DRC FP rounding modes.
- 29th March     2003: Aaron Giles added MIPS 4 (R5000) support to the MIPS 3 (R4600) CPU core and he added dynamic recompiling to both of them.

15.9   PSXCPU

- 0.186              : Added cpu\psx\psxdefs.h.
- 0.180              : Changed the PSXCPU disassembler to use 'std::ostream &' internally [Nathan Woods].
- 0.178              : Fixed buffer overflow when debugging (cpu\psx\psxdasm.cpp) [smf].
- 0.157              : Changed clocks to rising edge (bus\psx\memcard.h and multitap.c) [Carl].
- 0.156              : Removed cpu\psx\siodev.c/h. Changed mess\machine\psxanalog.c/h, psxcard.c/h, psxcport.c/h and psxmultitap.c/h to bus\psx\analogue.c/h, ctlrport.c/h, memcard.c/h and multitap.c/h. Renamed PSX controller and memory card files. Converted PSX SIO to use devcb [smf].
- 0.153              : Use an interface for passing state to the disassembler instead of copying it into a structure for every line. Fixed lui/ori and lui/addi constant calculation by pretending instructions can be 8 bytes long [smf].
- 0.151              : Stopped div 0x80000000 in PSXCPU, 0xffffffff from causing an overflow exception. All loads cancel an outstanding load to the same register, not just lwl/lwr. Fix for "Complete a line of animals in Zooo (V2.01J) and the game will reset" by defaulting PSXCPU ram to 0. I don't know whether this is guaranteed or whether it's a game or emulation bug. Also tidied up a few things and added a couple of comments [smf].
- 0.150              : Removed some left-over TIMER_CALLBACK_MEMBER declarations (psx\dma.h and rcnt.h) [Oliver Stöneberg]. Added undocumented opcode that behaves like DPCL (cpu\psx\gte.c and psxdasm.c) [smf].
- 0.149u1            : Don't clear m_berr on every instruction in PSXCPU [smf].
- 0.149              : Added a check for a bus error when fetching an instruction, the bus error condition is cleared before the fetch so bus errors in the debugger don't cause an exception to be triggered. Fixed GTE FLAG register calculation on MSVC builds (psx\gte.c). Slightly more defensive ram & rom mapping (cpu\psx\psx.c). Updated comment (psx\dma.c) [smf].
- 0.148u5            : Don't set E flag if the result rounds up to 2, just limit the result. PSX BIOS rom memory map is now handled by the CPU core as the size is controlled by an internal register. Simplified System 12 protection hack so that it doesn't involve remapping the bios rom area, which also allows the default value for ram to be removed. Use device timers instead of TIMER_CALLBACK_MEMBER (cpu\psx\dma.c/h and rcnt.c/h). Changed I/O to 16 bits and don't install memory handlers at run time (cpu\psx\psx.c). Removed unused variable. Don't map more than 4MB of rom as it will overwrite ram. Only causes a problem for mrdrilr2 because the bios is part of a much larger rom, none of the other drivers have a region large enough to cause a problem (cpu\psx\psx.c) [smf]. Work around MSVC2008/2010 warning (C4701: potentially uninitialized local variable 'h_over_sz3' used) [Phil Bennett].
- 0.148u4            : Brought disassembler up to date (psx\psxdasm.c). Removed some unused #defines & whitespace changes (psx\gte.c). Improved FLAG calculation in NCDS, CDP, NCDT, NCCS, CC, NCS, NCT & NCCT by checking for overflow after each addition (psx\gte.c). Fixed MVMVA flag calculation & replicate the bugs when mx is set to 3 or cv is set to 2 (psx\gte.c). Fixed RTPS flags and calculation. Fixed RTPT flags calculation & added a new divide implementation that uses a much smaller table (psx\gte.c). Removed comment as the divider is new (psx\gte.h). Partial support for setting the RAM size, if the size is set larger than the actual memory then RAM is repeated. As a result the RAM is no longer included in the drivers memory map, you have to specify the size in the machine (psx\dma.c/h, psx.c/h, drivers\konamigq.c, konamigv.c, ksys573.c, namcos10.c, namcos11.c, namcos12.c, taitogn.c, twinkle.c, zn.c and psx.c). Added a temporary way to get to the PSX RAM as a couple of share1 lookups remained. Renamed the gte acc class to int44 to better describe what it is & uses the register names instead of the array index in a couple of places. Make it clearer that you can't write to LZCR (psx\gte.c). Changed loop detection hack to use address mask to stop it crashing, NFS Vrally 2 doesn't crash straight away but it's graphics are completely corrupt (psx\dma.c). PSX CPU creates a ram device, this has exposed a problem with not removing the child devices from the hash map when removing replacing devices. At the moment I have changed device.c so that when any device is removed the hash maps are reset. Changed default value of ram to zero. Some of the system 12 games compared ram that hasn't been written to with the result from what we think is the keycus [smf]. Don't clear busy status until done and skip padding. This fixes the RE3 opening (psx\mdec.c). Be a bit more permissive with allowed transfer types from the CDROM (psx\dma.c) [Carl].
- 0.148u3            : Corrected PSXCPU lwr mem_mask. Fixed a few comments (cpu\psx\psx.c). Reduced time before DMA interrupt is fired, as it stops incorrect textures being displayed in a few games and the PSE BIOS v2.2 (cpu\psx\dma.c). Added a note about how the time hack breaks other things. Fixed GTE A1/A1/A3 flag calculation when the result exceeds the maximum bounds. GPF & DPCT work with all values of sf & lm (cpu\psx\gte.c). Changed dcpl to dpcl to match official documentation, updated disassembly to match emulation (cpu\psx\gte.c and psxdasm.c). Update RGB FIFO 4 bytes at a time (psx\gte.c). Fixed GTE GPL & DCPL opcodes by porting over some changes from an old tree. Simplified MAC handling in GTE and fixed some incorrectly calculated values. Assumed flag register always gets cleared (psx\gte.c). Added comment to GTE_OP() that it's not used. This and the other two #defines that are marked as not used are probably not used on the real hardware either [smf].
- 0.148u2            : Fixed uninitialized members in cpu\psx\psx.c, rcnt.c and siodev.c [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.148u1            : Uses a DEVCB2 for CPU to CD controller communication, the address decoding is internal to the CPU & the CD controller is on it's own 8 bit bus. Use DEVCB2 for CPU to CPU hookup as it's on it's own 16 bit bus. Removed the SPU hookup in TaitoGN at 0x1fa51c00 as it doesn't make sense, will wait for bug reports before investigating further [smf]. Force controller reset with SIO reset (cpu\psx\sio.c) [Carl].
- 0.148              : Removed machine\psx.c and includes\psx.h. Removed psx_state, all code shared between MAME and MESS is now in src\emu [smf].
- 0.147u4            : Preliminary DCPL GTE opcode (cpu\psx\gte.c) [smf].
- 0.147u3            : Added cpu\psx\siodev.c/h. Fixed CD & root counter irq's (cpu\psx\irq.c). Use DEVCB2 for hooking up irq controller to cpu core [smf]. Turned ZN security into a device (cpu\psx\sio.h). Split PSX SIO into two devices. Replaced usage of psx_sio_install_handler & psx_sio_input with devices [smf].
- 0.147u2            : Removed some legacy code (cpu\psx\psx.c, video\psx.h, includes\psx.h and machine\psx.c). Hooked up PSX IRQ's using DEVCB2 [smf].
- 0.142u4            : Added cpu\psx\irq.c/h, mdec.c/h, rcnt.c/h and sio.c/h. Various changes for PSX HW [smf]: Modernised internal memory map. MDEC is now an internal device of the PlayStation CPU. Root counter & Serial I/O converted to internal CPU devices. Moved PlayStation IRQ code to sub device of the CPU.
- 0.142u3            : Moved dismips.c, dismips.mak, psx.c/h and psxdasm.c from cpu\mips\ to cpu\psx\. Added cpu\psx\dma.c/h and gte.c/h. smf converted PlayStation DMA to an internal device to the CPU core. DMA to external devices can be set in the machine config, the old calls are still there until the rest of the code is converted.
- 0.141u4            : Changed name 'PSX CPU' to 'PSXCPU'. smf converted PSX CPU core to C++.
- 0.135u1            : Harmony removed some magic numbers from machine\psx.c, replaced with #defines.
- 0.130              : smf fixed PSX CPU disassembly of -$8000, it was showing up as -$0.
- 0.129              : smf implemented GTE divider using reciprocal table derived by pSXAuthor, this should allow the results to be calculated as inaccurately as the real hardware.
-  3rd January   2009: smf - Last, but by no means least is pSXAuthor's investigation into the GTE divider. It has been known for a while that emulation of the divider is too accurate. I spent a little time looking at it last year & hypothisized that it multiplied using a reciprocal table. Independently pSXAuthor actually did the hard work of reverse engineering it & has kindly donated his discoveries. So everyone can enjoy innaccurate divisions. I doubt it has a major effect on anything, but it makes it easier to compare GTE results from the emulator to be compared to the results on a PlayStation. I plan on restarting the work to improve MAME's GTE, I have some fixes from last year but so much has changed since then that it's not just a copy & paste. BTW I think I introduced a bug in the division but it probably won't have a visible effect, but if you're thinking of taking the code for another emulator it might be worth waiting a while.
- 0.128u4            : Changed cpu\mips\mipsdasm.c to psxdasm.c. Pointerified the PSX CPU core and switched it to the new memory functions. Changed some MIPS_* to PSXCPU_* [smf].
- 0.124u3            : PSX core updates [smf]: Removed casts and removed unnecessary decoding from NCLIP. Added signed values to PAIR & PAIR64. Renamed PAIR64.lw to PAIR64.q. Tidied up DPCS, improved flag calculation and added support for lm/sf fields. Added sf/lm support to INTPL, improved flag calculation & calculates correct RGB. Fixed calculation of bit 31 of GTE FLAG register, when writing to it directly. Added lm mode to OP and fixed the calculation. Added lm mode to SQR.
- 0.124u2            : PSX updates [smf]: Fixed the SR masks for MTC0. Added ability to test the instruction/data cache ram. The scratchpad and BIU register are now handled internally to the CPU. All writes are performed with masks. SWL/SWR used to be implemented with two writes ( one byte and one word ) when writing three bytes, now it only ever performs one. Byte and Word writes use masks as they leave the rest of the register on the bus, which can be picked up by larger registers. The read/write functions to use are cached when the SR bits are updated, as are the bad address masks. Added coprocessor 1 & 3 support, though they don't do anything useful. All loads now go through the delay pipeline, a lwl/lwr will grab the value out of the pipeline if it's updating the same register. Added undocumented behaviour of BLEZ/BGTZ. The comparison for zero can be changed by specifying an alternate register in the RT field ( the documentation says you should always use register 0 ). Restricted to 16 COP0 registers & generate an exception if any of the 5 for the MMU are used. Added BCF/BCT instructions, although I have found no conditions that affect them yet. Generates an exception if any MMU instructions are executed. Sets the CE instruction for all exceptions, not just those involving a coprocessor. The bits of the opcode that specify the coprocessor are grabbed no matter what the instruction. Added TAR register and BT bit in SR. When an exception occurs during a branch, BT determines whether it was taken or not. The TAR register gets set to the destination of the branch. Fixed the BD bit when you are in a branch delay slot and you didn't take the branch, this shows up in the pipeline as !pc. Fixed branches within a branch delay slot. Multiply & divide instructions can be aborted if you write to HI/LO before reading the result. Added data breakpoints, you don't appear to be able to set breakpoints on any of the addresses internal to the CPU. Multiply/divide/GTE instructions can execute when an exception is taken, although the EPC indicates that it hasn't. The BIOS avoids rerunning GTE instructions as they are destructive, so you have to make sure they run. Added bus error handling, PSXCPU is limited to 8MB of ram & any access outside this range will trigger an exception. I believe this is to be an internal limit. Added CXD8661R as a specific CPU type, System 12 appears to allow more than 8MB of ram & it's possible that this is different. Mapped out all instructions to either generate an exception or ignore bits. Updated the disassembler to match the decoding. Fixed disassembling of branch instructions in a branch delay slot. Lui checks for a ori/addiu following and will show you the result. Added step over/out support. Fixed standalone disassembler. Fixed SZ0 truncation. Fixed IRGB truncation and conversion to IR1/IR2/IR3. Added IR1/IR2/IR3 saturation when calculating ORGB. Fixed OTZ sign extension. Fixed reading from SXYP. Fixed reading from IRGB. Fixed writing to LZCR. Fixed sign extension of GTE control registers. Fixed writing to FLAG. Fixed flag calculation in F macro and fixed avsz3 & avsz4 flag & otz calculation.
-  8th April     2008: smf - 1 on 1 Government Revisited: Most of my work recently has been to improve the accuracy of the PlayStation CPU emulation. This hasn't made much of a difference to any games, though if you write your own code and it runs on the emulator then it's more likely to run on the real thing. I've now moved onto writing GTE unit tests, there were a couple of games with geometry issues & I wanted to have some visible sign of progress. This is the result of improving the data transfer between the CPU and the GTE. There are a few GPU issues, but I'll get to them some other time. Someone will need to write a cheat for this though, or explain to me how to beat the computer.
- 0.122u6            : First pass at fixing the CPU clock speeds on the Playstation based hardware. The internal divide in the CPU core has been set to 4 as we have no wait states, incorrect DMA timing, no gpu timing, no DMA bus stealing and no gte timing [smf]. Changed PSX CPU clock speed to 67737600 Hz.
- 16th January   2008: smf - The clockspeed of the PSX based games in MAME has always been a little on the low side. Mainly to make up for the lack of cache emulation and bus contention, also partly because the GTE timing isn't emulated yet. Due to the recent attention to crystals, there has been some investigation as to what the real clock speed should be. Thanks to Guru's probing we are able to say for definate what is going on. The CPU has an internal divider and on the majority of boards is fed a 67.7376MHz clock. I have currently got MAME to report this frequency, with an internal divider of 4 to keep it roughly the same as before ( it should be 2 but I'll leave that until the rest of the timing issues are sorted ). Some information has been floating around for a while that has never been confirmed & now seems to be a good time. The 67MHz clock doesn't appear on the namco system 12 or the later system 10 boards. It appears they have their own higher rated part. System 12 runs on a 100MHz clock, while system 10 runs on a 101.4912MHz clock. So system 12 being faster has been elevated from rumour, to probable. The GPU clock is the same across all hardware. I'd have thought they'd have done something about that, especially as all the system 12 games like to run in interlace. Maybe it's more efficient or has faster ram, we'll leave that one for another day.
- 0.110              : smf and Aaron Giles fixed crash when resetting PSX games.
- 25th August 2006   : smf - As Ian guessed the answer for real hardware is 0x1234def0. Currently MAME ignores the byte write completely and gives 0x12345678. This is because when it's testing which half of the register is being accessed, it only considers word or dword writes. That should be easy to sort out, it just needs a different check for the mem_mask. The real problem comes because the program_write_byte_32le call only takes a byte, so there is no way to pass the extra bits. I have coded some alternate memory handlers that allow you to specify a mem_mask value & then the shifting can be handled by the cpu core. This is slower when accessing RAM though as instead of a byte write it's performing a read, two ands, a not and then a write. I could change the data type for program_write_byte_32le, but thats a bit hacky. Passing the mem_mask in would also allow lwl/lwr/swl/swr to be emulated correctly when it's accessing three bytes ( there is no program_write_triple_32lw, yet...). Progress has been stalled after I upgraded to 0.108 to start work on the memory handlers, but then the debug build of mess locked up and the non-debug build displayed the screen in kaleidoscope-vision. I fixed both problems & then found that the lockup was fixed in 0.108u1 when Aaron changed timer.c. So, back to more interesting things...
-  1st August 2006   : smf - Olivier Galibert gets one of the four points, the question was... What are the possible effects? & both b and d are possible. B will occur when ra is in the range 0-7fffffff, the relative branch is affected by being in a branch delay slot (the clue was in the title of the post). Disassembling branch instructions becomes a bit more complex, lets hope nobody ever uses this. (1 point) D will occur when ra is in the range 80000000-ffffffff, which is the most likely as most software runs in kernel space on the PlayStation. (1 point). If an interrupt occurs when the pc is 8001f6e4 then B will happen whatever value ra is as the nop is in the delay slot of the bgez and the PlayStation always subtracts 4 from the PC when restarting after an exception (1 point). Last of all is a bonus point because the bgez instruction encoding is non standard, but the PlayStation ignores the extra bits that are set ( the standard encoding would be ff ff e1 07 ). Nobody else scored a point because the explanation was just as important as picking one of the answers ( or you could have just said a, b, c & d ). If I'd thought about it more I'd have used bgezal ra, I'll try to prepare more next time.

16.2   Am29000

- 0.186              : Changed name 'AMD Am29000' to 'AMC Am29000'.
- 0.179              : Changed the AM29000 disassembler to use std::ostream internally (cpu\am29000\am29dasm.cpp) [Nathan Woods]. Removed unnecessary formatstr() & fixed setting PC [smf].
- 0.149u1            : Changed name 'Am29000' to 'AMD Am29000'. Modernized Am29000 cpu core. Moved added initialization to constructor [Wilbert Pol].

- 16th Janary    2010: Phil Bennett - I finally wrote the Am29000 CPU core needed by F-15 Strike Eagle, Battle of the Solar System and Tank Battle. Emulation of the math unit and 3D hardware soon followed. The 3D performance of the system is a step above Hard Drivin' and co given that the 3D pipeline is implemented mostly in hardware. The average framerate is ~30fps as opposed to 15. Worth mentioning is the extra sound hardware that is used to generate LOUD explosions. It's like something from an analog synthesiser - there's two channels of white with pink noise passed through an SSM2047 VCF. I've included a slightly fudged but reasonable sounding simulation of it. F-15 and BOTSS play ok but they're shameless quarter suckers, regularly pestering the player to pump in more credits to buy weapons, repairs, fuel etc. Tank Battle (aka Super Tank Attack and Tank 3D) is a prototype game. It supports two players via split-screen. I can't find a way to disable the split-screen for single player though.
- 16th May       2004: Phil Bennett - With a reasonable amount of free-time on my hands I've resumed work on the Am29000 core. Most of the instructions are implemented, but it's not quite up to the job yet...
- 30th March     2004: Phil Bennett - Working on F-15 Strike Eagle for the past few weeks. Currently, the 68000 and TMS34010 are hooked up. The game starts with a bit of high kludgery, but without an Am29000 core (a 32-bit RISC CPU responsible for generating the 3D objects) it's far from playable. In addition, an 80C31 MCU core is needed for sound emulation. Battle of the Solar System and Super Tank Attack run on similar hardware, but there's not a lot to show from them at the moment. I've began writing an Am29000 core (it disassembles code at the moment), but with the sheer amount of academic work I'm lumbered with at the moment progress will be slow.

- 0.103u4            : Fixes to the Hyperstone core [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]: Removed nested delays. Don't allow software opcodes to be executed in a delay slot.
- 30th January   2006: Working hard on Eolith games. This time I could make Hidden Catch - (c)1998 Eolith to work. It suffered from a nasty bug in the Hyperstone cpu core, because it used a memory instruction which reads data from the memory address stored in the source register, writes the data read in the destination register and then increments the source register by 4, but... if source and destination registers are the same? Well, it only incremented the register instead of reading the data from memory without incrementing it. This is strange because they could have used a normal instruction which does the same but doesn't increment the source register, but anyway... probably the compiler was a bit crap.

- 0.154              : Added a bunch of unhandled MB86233 opcodes for TGP, this apparently fixed Virtua Cop 2 geometry. Used a new opcode, from VF2. Stupid mistake from my part in TGP undocumented opcode, fixes character appearing/logic in Virtua Cop 2. Fixed Indirect Mode addressing in TGP (cpu\mb86233\mb86233.c), fixes Manx TT crash on gameplay (bikes are invisible tho, Z sort issue?). Also added most inputs for Manx TT minus gear shifts. Fixed for External->Reg opcode in TGP, VF2 now boots then dies a bunch of seconds later in gameplay/attract. Updated VF2 opcodes, and fixed Sky Target 3D display. Fixed TGP area access in Sky Target. Some changes to TGP with no noticeable effect. Bunch of TGP opcodes used by VF2 [Angelo Salese].
- 0.150              : Modernized MB86233 cpu core [Wilbert Pol].

Added analog ports reading for model 2A/B/C. Fixed some loading instructions in the TGP. that fixes srallyc automatic transmission bug.
- 0.119u4            : El Semi added the repeat count register (reg 0x34) access and immediate value load to the MB86233 core (needed by Pilot Kids).
- 0.119u1            : Synchronized the MB86233 core with ElSemi's, fixing a few bugs along the way [Ernesto Corvi].

- 0.113u3            : Added cpu\mb86233\mb86233.c/h and mb86233d.c. Ernesto Corvi added a preliminary MB86233 CPU core. Still needs to be hooked up to the Sega Model 2 driver.
- 12th October 2005: Charles MacDonald - I acquired a Virtua Fighter boardset a while ago and am tracing out the board connections to figure out how everything works. Eventually I'd like to get my own code running on the system to investigate TGP functions and to document the Model 1 hardware, but in the meantime just figuring out the organization of everything is important. I ended up removing the V60 from a spare System 32 board to figure out the pin assignments for the QFP-variety V60 within a reasonable time frame, necessary for Model 1 work. The board is still functional, just needs a CPU now.
- NOTES: The Fujitsu TGP chip MB86233 is a coprocessor (aparently part of the Sparc/SparcLite family of processors) and is used extensively to create the 3D objects. It's a 32-bit Co-Processors and supports Floating Point, Stem Rotate, and 3D Matrix operations. Capable of 16 MFlops.

19.1   PowerPC 4xx/6xx

- 0.182              : Clear two LSBs of the branch target address. This is what a real CPU does in order to prevent branching to an invalid address [Maxim Poliakovski].
- 0.181              : Set DSISR to the DSI flags rather than the address on data access faults [R. Belmont, Maximumspatium]. Fixed DSI flag bits. Alignment exceptions will need more complex mask/shift depending on the instruction's addressing mode, but that's a job for another time; at any rate it uses the LSBs of the DSISR register [Vas Crabb, Maximumspatium].
- 0.180              : Moved the declaration for ppc_dasm_one() to a header file. Changed the PowerPC disassembler to use 'std::ostream &' internally. Eliminated 'ppc_dasm_one(std::string &string,...' trampoline. Removed 'ppc_dasm_one(std::string &string,...' declaration and updated caller. Changed buffer.vec() to &buffer.vec()[0] [Nathan Woods].
- 0.174              : Fixed PPC targets (video\rgbvmx.h) [Vas Crabb].
- 0.173              : Use the new instructions for FPU loads and stores (cpu\powerpc\ppcdrc.cpp). Map some FPU registers to physical registers. Optimized powerpc\ppcdrc.cpp [Ville Linde].
- 0.172              : Handle divide by zero (cpu\powerpc\ppcdrc.cpp) [Ville Linde].
- 0.169              : Removed dead PPC code (cpu\powerpc\drc_ops.cpp/h, ppc.cpp, ppc403.inc, ppc602.inc, ppc603.inc, ppc_mem.inc, ppc_ops.h/inc and ppc_ops.inc) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.158              : Fixed unterminated strings in powerpc debugger (cpu\powerpc\ppccom.c) [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.156              : Converted remaining PPC callbacks to delegates [Osso]. Fixed line endings [Carl, MetalliC]. Added command-line option -[no]drc_log_uml to control DRC UML disassembly logging. Allows logging of DRC UML disassembly without re-compiling / removes. DRCUML_OPTION_LOG_UML and all the core-specific LOG_UML defines (cpu\powerpc\ppccom.c). Added command-line option -[no]drc_log_native to control DRC native diassembly logging. Allows logging of DRC native disassembly without re-compiling, removes DRCUML_OPTION_LOG_NATIVE and all the core-specific LOG_NATIVE defines, added logging() to drcbe_interface and added logging_native() to drcuml_state [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.155              : Fixed wrong condition register in stwcx (powerpc\ppcdrc.c). Fixed unaligned 64-bit accesses [Ville Linde].
- 0.154              : Removed emu\eigccppc.h and eigccx86.h. Moved PowerPC legacy handlers to member of cpu classes [Miodrag Milanovic]. Modernised PowerPC cpu core [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.153              : Changed cpu\powerpc\ppc_ops.c to ppc_ops.inc [Oliver Stöneberg]. Using delegates instead of read/write_device_func in ppc core [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.150              : Made both DRC and Non-DRC compile for MIPS, RSP and SH2 core and added option to enable/disable DRC from command line (-drc -nodrc by default it's on). Added command line option to force DRC C backend (emu\emuopts.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.148u1            : Added direct dynamic entry load to virtual TLB (cpu\vtlb.c). vtlb_fill doesn't appear to provide an easy way to determine whether a failure is due to a presence or permission error also entries need to be marked dirty or the performance improvement is minimal [Carl].
- 0.147              : Fixed 601-type BAT processing (cpu\powerpc\ppccom.c) [R. Belmont].
- 0.146u5            : Added callbacks for buffered external DMAs (ppc.h + ppccom.c/h) [Ville Linde]. Fixed SRAW behavior with C backend. x86/x64 BEs need work to pass (powerpc\ppcdrc.c) [R. Belmont].
- 0.146u4            : Added optional PPC callback for explicit data cache stores. Hooked up data cache store callback to Konami Cobra driver. Exposed segment registers to the debugger (ppc.h + ppccom.c). Changed cap flags to UINT32 for future additions [Ville Linde].
- 0.146              : Added PPC405GP to PPC cpu core [Lukasz Markowski]. Added custom DCR read/write handlers to PPC cpu core. Cleanup powerpc\ppc.c, ppccom.c and ppcdrc.c [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.145u5            : Further DIVW improvements. More flags work. All integer divide instructions now 100% pass PPCTorture. Improved corner case behavior of SLW/SRW [R. Belmont].
- 22nd March     2012: R. Belmont - Been working on debugging MAME/MESS's PowerPC core - this should improve our Sega Model 3 compatibility as well as make some stuff in MESS run better. This work has also exposed some issues in MAME's recompiler framework that could improve issues with games using other DRC-based CPU cores once solved.
- 0.145u4            : Properly mirror SO bit from XER into CR0 in powerpc/ppcdrc.c. Corrected DIVW divide-by-zero crashes, flags and corner-case results [R. Belmont].
- 0.138u4            : Atari Ace fixed overlapping data buffers in the PowerPC core.
- 0.138u3            : Aaron Giles fixed performance regression for PowerPC games. The timing made heavy use of cpu_get_total_cycles() which is now slow. Better to use the legacy_cpu_device directly and call device->total_cycles() which avoids the dynamic_cast to find the execute interface from a generic device.
- 0.133              : Aaron Giles added FP registers to PPC debugger interface. Fixed bugs in the x64 back-end that prevented proper 3D rendering for Model 3 games.
- 0.130              : Aaron Giles added function calls to replace the MIPS3 and PowerPC DRC's various CPU_SET_INFO bits.
- 0.129              : Aaron Giles removed HAS_PPC* in favor of a single HAS_POWERPC, and a single definition in cpu.mak for all PowerPC variants.
- 0.128u6            : Pointer-ified the PowerPC core [Aaron Giles].
- 0.125u7            : Aaron Giles changed DRC frontend to pass a pointer to the previous instruction when describing. Updated PowerPC frontend to approximately take into account branch and CR logic folding in timing computations. Aaron Giles added save state support to the MIPS3 recompiler and virtual TLB system.
- 0.125u6            : Added cpu\vtlb.c/h. Created common virtual TLB managment module. Updated MIPS and PowerPC code to make use of it [Aaron Giles].
- 0.125u2            : Changed cpu\powerpc\ppcdrc.c to cpu\powerpc\ppcdrco.c.
- 0.121u3            : Ville Linde added PowerPC 604 processor support. Moved PowerPC opcode tables to the CPU context to allow multiple simultaneous processors with different opcode tables.
- 0.120u3            : Vas Crabb cleaned up the inline assembly for both x86 and PPC, enabled the mul32 family assembly stuff on 32-bit x86, and fixed some compiler warnings on 64-bit GCC. In addition: * Provided single-precision reciprocal approximation code for PowerPC and x86 with SSE2. * Filled in all other TBD functions in eigccx86.h for completeness. * Conditionalised some code in eigccppc.h so that it isn't used when the compiler has 64-bit instructions available.
- 0.120u2            : Added emu\eigccppc.h.
- 0.118u6            : Aaron Giles made a cleanup pass through the new x86emit.h code emitters, changing the way memory is referenced and replacing macros with inline functions. Updated MIPS and PowerPC drc cores to use the new emitters. Removed the old macro-based ones in x86drc.h.
- 0.115u1            : Ville Linde added lswx and stswx opcodes to the PowerPC core.
- 0.114u3            : Made the PowerPC dynarec options runtime configurable [Ville Linde].
- 0.101u3            : Nathan Woods updated PowerPC core to use new disassembler style.
- 0.99u3             : Ville Linde fixed PowerPC recompiler so that Scud Race works again.
- 0.98u2             : More PowerPC updates [Nathan Woods]: Moved update_counters() to be executed after the DRC epilogue code is appended; now behaves more like the non-DRC core. Fixed some bugs in DRC exeception handling (SRR1 was not being set up properly, and not all MSR flags were being cleared). Refactored DRC core to call MMU hooks. ISI exceptions will now be thrown if the MMU hooks report an unexecutable address in the DRC core. Fixed a rounding error in the decrementer. Added support for decrementer exceptions when the DEC register is written to in both cores. Added support for ISI/DSI exceptions with setjmp()/longjmp() in the non-DRC core.
- 0.98u1             : PowerPC core update [Nathan Woods]: Added infrastructure to generate DSI and ISI exceptions. Made the lbz/lbzu/lbzux/lbzx instructions properly clear out the high 24 bits in the results. Added SRR0 and SRR1 to the debug view.
- 0.97u4             : Added cpu\powerpc\ppc_mem.c. More PowerPC improvements [Nathan Woods]: Fixed exception handling; previously the MSR register was stored in EDX, and EDX is not preserved across the call to ppc_set_msr(). Implemented recompile_fcmpo(). Fixed certain rules in rules.mak (some said drc_ops.h instead of drc_ops.c). Commented the MSR_* values. Moved BAT registers into their own structure. Added DSI and ISI exceptions (non-DRC core only for now). Moved READ*/WRITE* functions into ppc_mem.c. Changed memory handling so that reading and writing are done through function pointers that can be changed at runtime (which would be useful if, say a MMU was implemented in the future). Yet another fix to the PowerPC counters, reimplementing them from scratch [Ville Linde].
- 0.97u3             : Improvements to the PowerPC cores [Ville Linde]: Rewrote the interrupt handling in the interpreter core so it matches the DRC core. Fixed MCRXR instruction.

Rewrote lswi/stswi as subroutines. Made accesses to tempdata explicitly dword or qword. Fixed SRR0 when generating a syscall. Removed no longer necessary TESTs on extsb/w, rlwinm, rlwnm, rlwimi and cntlzw. Fixed bug where the SO flag was not being computed for compares. Fixed flag computations for mulhw/mulhwu/mullw. Fixed subtlety of shifts between 32 and 63 in srw/sraw. Fixed mffs/mtfsf to use FP registers. Fixed mtfsfi to use the immediate value properly. Now marking terminal count bit in DMA status register. Added support for 4xx protection registers via the MMU. Added TLBH, TLBU, and DEC to the list of registers in the debugger. Turned off "end of transfer" DMA signals in favor of "transfer count 0" signals; fixes memory-to-memory DMA in fiveside. Minor flags optimizations: * Broke CR into several individual bits of state and * Extracted the SO bit from XER into its own state. Cleaned up register tracking implementation. Fixed numerous errors and shortcomings in the tracking. Added support for removing unnecessary XER CA and CR0 computations. Updated UML logging to output new frontend statistics. Added basic cycle counts for longer instructions. Added penalty for polling timebase and decrementer registers. Fixed dependencies in cpu.mak.

Added explicit address truncation to 31 bits for 4xx series. Added new PPCDRC_ACCURATE_SINGLES option, which removes the excessive (and very likely unecessary) extra rounding when performing the "fast" single-precision floating point ops. Fixed TLB filling for 4XX protection ranges. Fixed parameter ordering for masked reads/writes. Added detection of MMU enablement in 403GCX case. Fixed bug in protection bounds violation detection for 4XX. Changed SPU receive model to a push model; updated drivers accordingly. Added macros for setting the SPU transmit handler and sending bytes. Cleaned up ppc.h. Fixed lmw/stmw if rA is one of the loaded/stored registers. Removed unnecessary variables & structure members. Optimized for the XER and CR0 case where XER doesn't need an overflow calculation.
- 0.125u4            : Changed cpu\powerpc\ppcdrco.c to cpu\powerpc\ppccom.c/h. Added cpu\powerpc\ppcdrc.c and ppcfe.c/h. Universal recompiler: * Fixed frontend to handle opcode widths different from bus width. * Added several new opcodes: (D)GETFLGS - copies the UML flags to a destination operand and FDRNDS - rounds a double precision value to single precision. * Renamed several opcodes: (SETC   -> CARRY), (XTRACT -> ROLAND) and (INSERT -> ROLINS). * Consolidated the following opcodes: (LOAD?U -> LOAD), (LOAD?S -> LOADS), (STORE? -> STORE), (READ?U -> READ), (READ?M -> READM), (WRITE? -> WRITE), (WRITM? -> WRITEM), (SEXT?  -> SEXT), (FTOI?? -> FTOINT), (FFRI?  -> FFRINT) and (FFRF?  -> FFRFLT). * Removed some opcodes: FLAGS (can be done with GETFLGS/LOAD4/ROLINS), ZEXT (can be achieved with AND) and READ?S (can be achieved with READ/SEXT). * Updated C, x86, and x64 back-ends to support these opcode changes. * Updated disassembler to support these opcode changes. PowerPC dynamic recompiler [Aaron Giles]: Rewrote PowerPC implementation as a dynamic recompiler on top of the universal recompiler engine. * Wrote a front-end to analyze PowerPC code paths and register usage. * Wrote a common shared module with C implementations of tricky CPU behaviors. * Added separate CPU types for the variants supported, instead of relying on a hidden model enum. * Rewrote the serial port emulation for the 4xx series to be more accurate and not rely on separate DMA handlers. * Rewrote the MMU handling to implement a software TLB that faults in pages and handles changed bits appropriately. * Implemented emulation of the PowerPC 603's software TLB, which allows the model 3 games to run without a hack to disable the MMU. Aaron Giles updated the PowerPC disassembler to share constants with the rest of the core, and to more aggressively use simplified mnemonics, especially for branches.
- 0.125              : Aaron Giles added xchg and a few other missing opcodes to x86emit.h.

- 0.81u4             : MIPS DRC fixes [Aaron Giles]: Fixes an edge case where a memory access like: lw  r3,$0(r0). Would leave the stack in a funny state and lead to a crash. Instructions of the form: ld   r10,0(r10). Would load the low word into r10 first, and then use the modified r10 (plus 4) as the address of the high word. Fixes the sky graphics in several of the kinst2 levels.

- 0.142u3            : O. Galibert fixed op_debug implementation (drcbex64).
- 0.141u2            : Fix compile on systems that use the C backend (cpu\drcuml.h) [R. Belmont].
- 0.141u1            : Added cpu\drcbec.h, drcbex64.h, drcbex86.h and uml.c/h. Redo most of the DRC/backend support as C++. Yes, it is intentional that the x86/x64 backends compile everywhere. Backends are now derived from drcbe_interface and implement several required overrides. x86emit.h now uses namespaces so that the x86/x64 emitters can co-exist. New file uml.h/uml.c actually describes the UML language, separating out several concepts from drcuml.c [Aaron Giles].
- 0.135u4            : Minor DRC improvments [Aaron Giles]: Simplified RSP's misaligned memory accesses. Removed now-unnecessary shifts from direct memory accesses in mips3/powerpc drcs. Optimized AND with 0xff/0xffff/0xffffffff cases for x86/x64. Added rudimentary memory/register tracking in x86 backend to remove redundant loads. Aaron Giles added new profiler bucket for DRC recompilation.
- 0.135u1            : Aaron Giles fixed broken DRC logging.
- 0.129u2            : DRC frontends must now do their own opcode fetching unfortunately. Updated all DRC cores to do this. Also tweaked a few oddities in the SH2 DRC [Aaron Giles].
- 0.126u5            : R. Belmont fixed Cool Riders crash with DRC, now hangs waiting for impossible conditions again.
- 0.126u1            : Aaron Giles fixed edge case in the DRC front-end that would incorrectly tag the end of a sequence as "return to start" even if the last instruction did not abet the starting instruction.
- 0.125u7            : DRC fixes [Aaron Giles]: Fixed WRITEM opcode on 64-bit to call through memory instead of directly. Solves assertions with GCC 4.3 and 64-bit Linux. Fixed DCMP opcode on the 32-bit back-end. Fixed LZCNT opcode in x86 and x64 back-ends. Added support for flags in LZCNT and BSWAP opcodes on x86 and x64 back-ends. Aaron Giles changed DRC frontend to pass a pointer to the previous instruction when describing. Updated PowerPC frontend to approximately take into account branch and CR logic folding in timing computations.
- 0.125u6            : UML [Aaron Giles]: Reactivated back-end validation mechanism. Added back-end validation for ADD/SUB/MUL/DIV/CMP forms. Fixed several errors in dealing with more obscure flag combinations.
- 0.125u5            : Removed cpu\drcumld.c/h. DRC UML changes [Aaron Giles]: Separated conditions and flags into two separate fields. Added more extensive per-opcode information. Made validation more thorough using the extended information. Disabled back-end validation for now until it can be revisited using the new tables. Changed GETFLGS encoding so that the mask is in parameter 2 instead of the flags field. Wrote new disassembler based on enhanced opcode info structure. Moved disassembler into drcuml.c and removed old code. Extended disassembler buffer sizes to at least 256 bytes. Removed explicit flag requests from the shorthand opcodes. Added optimization function to drcuml which is called at block end. Added logic to compute the necessary flags based on upcoming opcodes and only select those flags which are required. Added NOP opcode. Added logic to simplify opcodes as much as possible at the UML layer. Removed similar logic in the x86 and x64 back-ends. Added stricter parameter validation for registers and mapvars. Improved disassembly output. Added simple symbol table to the UML for improved disassembly. Changed optional disassembler cache parameter to a drcuml object. Fixed STORE opcode description to allow immediate source operands. DRC frontend changes [Aaron Giles]: Changed from tracking "live" registers to tracking "necessary" registers. Genericized register tracking to be more flexible. Added previous instruction pointer to opcode descriptions.
- 0.125u3            : DRC frontend changes [Aaron Giles]: Fixed bug in handling edge case with the PC near the 0 or ~0. Added new flag to tag privileged instructions. UML updates [Aaron Giles]: Added new opcode SETC to set the carry flag from a source bit. Added new opcode BSWAP to swap bytes within a value. Updated C, x86, x64 back-ends to support the new opcodes. Updated disassembler to support the new opcodes.
- 0.125u2            : Universal DRC system updates and improvements [Aaron Giles]: UML: * Added back-end validation mechanism, and a handful of tests as examples. This will be expanded in the future. * Added several new opcodes: SAVE dumps the entire virtual machine state to a struct, RESTORE applies the data in a struct to the live state, LZCNT counts leading zeros in an operand, XTRACT extracts a bitfield to another register (rlwinm) and INSERT inserts a bitfield into a register (rlwimi). * Added new back-end function get_info() which returns information from the back-end about how many actual registers will be mapped. x86 back-end: * Implemented all new opcodes. * Implemented get_info() function. * Fixed several bugs relating to shifts/rotates and optimizing out cases incorrectly. x64 back-end: * Implemented all new opcodes. * Implemented get_info() function. * Added defines for new Penryn opcodes to x86emit.h. * Added support for ROUNDSS and ROUNDSD on Penryn architectures. This hasn't been tested. If you have a Penryn-based system, give it a try. * Fixed several bugs relating to shifts/rotates and optimizing out cases incorrectly. C back-end: * Implemented all new opcodes. * Implemented get_info() function. * Cleaned up operand sizing. * Fixed several errors that made it not work on bigendian systems. MIPS DRC: * Added some instrumentation for the MMU. To enable it, turn on PRINTF_MMU at the top of the file. * Fixed front-end so that virtual no-op instructions are still targeted as branch targets. * Fixed front-end to mark the beginning of each sequence as needing TLB validation, since any sequence can be jumped to from anywhere. * Redid the MIPS3 TLB implementation. Fixed the exception vector and type handling. Changed the bitfields to directly map from the MIPS TLB format. Added distinction between TLB fill and TLB valid/modified exceptions. * Added separate modes for user, supervisor and kernel modes. Each mode does proper verification of addresses now and generates address errors for invalid accesses. * Fixed several bugs in the TLB implementation; not everything works yet but it's a lot closer. * Made COP0 access checking mandatory in non-kernel modes. * Fixed several crashes when recompiling virtual no-ops. * Fixed TLB bug where entries for virtual address 0 were present by default. * Fixed bug in the map variable implementation that would sometimes result in incorrectly recovered values.* Implemented IDT instructions. All invalid instruction asserts are now runtime-only. * Added support to map a few common registers to machine registers if the machine supports it. Currently only x64 on Windows has enough free registers to do so, though PowerPC will almost certainly be able to take advantage of this. Gives a minor speedup. * Updated to use INSERT and XTRACT where appropriate. * Cleaned up register usage to free up one machine register for x64 on Linux.
- 0.125u1            : Added cpu\drcbec.c, drcbeut.c/h, drcbex64.c, drcbex86.c, drccache.c/h, drcuml.c/h, drcumld.c/h and drcumlsh.h. New universal dynamic recompiler system [Aaron Giles]: The central module is drcuml.c, which defines a universal machine language syntax that can be generated by a frontend recompiler and then retargeted via a generic backend interface to any of a number of different architectures. A disassembler for the UML is also included to allow examination of the generated UML code. Currently supported backend architectures include 32-bit x86, 64-bit x86, and a platform-neutral interpreted C backend that can be used as a fallback for platforms without native support. The C backend also performs additional validation to ensure assumptions are met. Along with the new architecture is a new MIPS III/IV recompiler frontend. This frontend has been rewritten from the old x64-specific recompiler to generate UML opcodes instead. This means that the single recompiler can be used to target multiple backend architectures and should in theory produce identical results across all of them. The old 32-bit and 64-bit MIPS recompilers are now officially retired. The new system provides similar performance (within 5% generally) to the old system and has similar compatibility. The only currently known issues are some problems with the two Gauntlet 3D games.
- 0.118u5            : Aaron Giles added more opcode emitters to x86emit.h.
- 0.118u4            : Added cpu\x86emit.h. Aaron Giles updated the x86 drc helper code to support externally-allocated cache. Also added support for allocating data structures out of the cache. Modified initialization so that it does not immediately generate code but rather waits for a reset to do that. Fixed code generation bug when generating [reg*scale] modrm forms. Aaron Giles added new module x86emit.h which supports dynamic code generation for both x86 and x64 systems. This new system is a far more complete solution, though not all opcodes are defined yet. The interface for this is also cleaner than the previous one defined in x86drc.h. Existing DRC cores are still using the old interface, but the new one is preferred for new development.
- 0.105u5            : Improvements to the x86 drc engine and the Windows blitters: Blitter CPUID features now accessed by drc_x86_get_features() call. Added win_blit_init(), to initialize the blitter. Changes to DRC to support usage for things other than CPU cores. Fixed drc_dasm() so it works once again. Added macros for a number of MMX/SSE instructions. Added a number of MMX/SSE instructions to the i386 disassembler.

- 0.125u5            : x86/x64 back-ends [Aaron Giles]: Added flag support to SEXT, ROLAND, ROLINS, LZCNT opcodes. Fixed bug where sometimes the flags would be corrupted; in particular, we always clobbered the flags for the subfze instruction, which broke the nbapbp camera and some other things. Fixed DIVS/DIVU opcode so they properly compute SZ flags when requested; fixes camera wackiness in nbapbp. Added a "hop" around the prolog of the HANDLE opcode to allow fall-through. Redesigned x86 stack management to keep the stack at the same 16-byte alignment. Fixed adc/sbb so that they don't optimize out ever. Fixed detection of special and/or/xor cases. Fixed GETFLGS opcode so that it doesn't return anything other than requested flags. Changed LZCNT/BSWAP to be more flexible in register selection.

Grazvydas Ignotas (notaz) added support for Sega Virtua Processor, to run Genesis/MegaDrive version of Virtua Racing, intended to be used by MESS. It consists of a CPU core SSP1601, and updates in megadriv.c. SSP1601 replaces SSP1610, as it has been confirmed that SVP actually contains SSP1601. The current SSP1610 is only a placeholder (nearly completely unimplemented) anyway. Changed megadriv.c add a new driver for Genesis/MegaDrive+SVP combination, also add SVP memory controller logic and memory map.
- 0.113u2            : Added cpu\ssp1610\ssp1610.c/h and ssp1610d.c. Pierpaolo Prazzoli added very preliminary SSP1610 CPU core.

21.8   TS-001-Turbo

-  1st June      2008: Charles MacDonald - V25 research: There are a number of instructions which delay interrupt and exception processing, allowing one more instruction to be executed before the interrupt is taken. For the prefixes, this prevents an interrupt from being taken after the prefix byte has been fetched but before the instruction it applies to has been executed. Likewise for segment register loads, if an interrupt occurred after SS was changed, SP would be invalid. By delaying interrupts the following types of sequences become uninterruptible. It seems less important to have DS and ES register loads delay interrupts as well, I did not expect this behavior. I have been looking at the MCU code for other games and it seems that they use similar, if not identical instruction encodings, despite using differently labeled MCUs. V-Five in particular seems to match the Knuckle Bash opcodes quite closely, and when/if I can get Knuckle Bash decrypted, I'll see how much of V-Five can be decrypted.
- 0.124u3            : David Haywood made some changes to the 'V25' code in toaplan2.c. Batsugun does upload what looks to be the entire program, unencrypted. If enabled it runs to the point of waiting for interrupts, however, for those it looks like it needs a real V25 core with register banks etc.
- 12th April     2008: Charles MacDonald - I recently acquired a Toaplan "Knuckle Bash" PCB. It's a fairly impressive system, based around a custom graphics chip which displays three tiled background layers and two 512x512 12-bit framebuffers for double buffered sprites. It has a 68HC000 running at 16 MHz that handles all the game related tasks, and a V25S MCU that manages inputs, sound effects, and music playback. The music for this game is quite good and definitely a notch above the rest. A lot of other Toaplan games use the same graphics chip, so I'm intending to run tests on it and get all the timing and other details worked out. The V25S microcontroller is a 80186 clone manufactured by NEC. Unlike the V25 it has no usable internal ROM and no 8080 emulation mode, the latter of which has been modified to add a new 'secure' operating mode. In secure mode a lookup table translates opcodes fetched from memory with their V25S equivalents. This allows the opcode-to-instruction mapping to be changed as the customer (Toaplan) sees fit, making the program code unusable unless the table contents are known. Luckily operands and data are not encrypted, and examination of the operands such as the ModR/M byte can reveal what category of instructions a particular opcode might fit in to. NEC intended for the V25S to be used as a drop-in replacement for the V25, to accomplish this it uses one of the unused V25 pins as a mode select input. When tied high or floating (due to an internal pull-up resistor) the CPU runs in normal mode, where the lookup table is bypassed and opcodes are processed normally. When tied low, the CPU is in secure mode and the lookup table is utilized. This pin is sampled during a reset, interrupt, or exception, and bit 15 of the PSW can be modified through select instructions to change the operating mode regardless of the pin state as well. These features allow a V25S to start in normal mode and selectively execute encrypted programs while still interacting with a unencrypted BIOS, operating system, and device drivers, or vice-versa. I modified the Knuckle Bash board to start the V25S in normal mode, and developed a program that sets the MCU to a known state and enters secure mode with the instruction trap feature enabled. This forces just one encrypted instruction to be executed before control is passed back to my unencrypted code, at which point the potentially modified state of the MCU is saved and examined. The behavior of all encrypted opcodes (except BRKS which sets up an unrecoverable state) can therefore be examined. I can see things like what data was pushed or popped from the stack, which registers were loaded, exchanged, or modified, and which instructions triggered an I/O or floating point exception. A lot of information can be gathered about the encrypted instructions, which narrows down or completely identifies which unencrypted instructions they map to. Best of all this technique should work for any V25S based system, such as the other Toaplan games. I'm looking forward to trying it on my Golden Axe 2 security board to see how effective it is after finishing with Knuckle Bash, though right now it's too early to give any indication of progress. Toaplan did an excellent job with the protection. The program ROM is filled with valid Z80 code and garbage data to throw off statistical analysis of the ROM, such as observing the frequency of occurence for particular bytes and byte sequences. The MCU has no manufacturer marking and has ambiguous names printed on it like "NITRO" and "DASH". Furthermore, the lookup table maps many opcodes to the same instructions so certain easily identifiable instructions can simply never be executed, increasing the number of potential matches any encrypted instruction might have. If this technique is applicable to the V35S, we'll have to see what Irem did with their games.
- 0.88               : Added MSM6295 sound via command tables in Batsugun and Knuckle Bash.
- NOTES: The Toaplan secondary cpu TS-001-Turbo is likely an NEC V25+ with some internal rom code and controls the YM2151 and OKI M6295 sound on some boards.

This allows the Sega Saturn console (SEGA 1994/5 Ver 1.01) to boot. The diagnostic cart (SEGA v0.5 1994) is now operational too, and it really shows how bad is our current Saturn emulation (and some very lovely Engrish as well.

Y-Bus command: MOV [s],Y can be executed in parallel to other Y-Bus commands. Jump and LPS/BTM support: jump addresses are absolute, prefetched instructions are executed before jump is taken, after each instruction, X and Y is multiplied and contents are loaded into MUL register.

21.A1  M37702S1

- 0.155              : Changed name 'M37702' to 'M37702S1'. Memory system and Namco improvements [Alex Jackson]: Explicit regions in address maps (AM_REGION) are now looked up relative to the device rather than as siblings when in an internal address map (similar to devices and shared pointers)  Besides being more orthogonal than before, this allows internal ROMs of MCUs and similar devices to be hooked up in a nicer and more foolproof way. Updated the m37710 and m5074x (m6502 derivative) to take advantage of this. Divided the M37702/M37710 into specific models, with each model having its own internal address map containing the correct amounts of internal RAM and ROM. M37702 MCUs found on various Namco PCBs are now all unique devices and have their respective internal ROMs loaded as device ROMs. Also did some spring (fall) cleaning in addrmap.c/memory.c/dimemory.c. m_devbase (the base device used for tagmap lookup when late-binding handlers and finding memory regions and shares) is now a reference rather than a pointer, since we know what it is when the address_map_entry is constructed and it doesn't change (it depends solely on whether it's an entry in an MCFG-provided address map or an internal one) And for the same reason, there's now only one m_devbase per address_map_entry rather than individual copies for read/write/setoffset/sharedptr. Removed mysterious unused address_map_entry member "m_region_string", along with a silly assert probably left over from when Aaron was replacing AM_BASE with AM_SHARE years ago. Added a comment noting that "make sure all devices exist" in device_memory_interface::interface_validity_check() actually does nothing, like the proverbial goggles. The reason there's just a comment and not a fix is I haven't figured out how to fix it yet (is it possible to extract the original device tag that was given to a proto-delegate? [Alex Jackson].

Fixed M377xx block transfers (move one less byte than the 65816).
- 0.104u2            : Updates to the M37710 core [R. Belmont]: Fixed LDM behavior when executing outside of bank 0. Fixed various global bugs when executing outside of bank 0. Fixed so top 8 bits of X & Y are preserved when in 8-bit index mode. Fixed some disassembly errors. Added save state support. Added M37702 alias for documentation purposes.
- 17th January   2006: R. Belmont - Phil Stroffolino was able to trojan and dump the BIOSes from the C71 3D math engine (actually a TMS32c025) and the C74 sound/inputs MCU (actually an M37702). He's already flying high with the C71 - using that code many long-standing graphics problems are now gone and several games that didn't work properly now work 100% (such as Ace Driver: Victory Lap).
- 11th January   2006: Charles MacDonald - I recently purchased two Suzuka 8 Hours PCBs (Namco System 2) and will see what can be done about trojaning the M37702-based C68 custom chip used on it. This would be helpful for System 2 and System 21 games. Also I'd like to take a closer look at the alternate type of video hardware this game has, since there seem to be some minor emulation issues in MAME.
-  4th January   2006: Charles MacDonald - Some information is needed about the M37702 MCUs used in various Namco games. If anyone can help, the following needs to be determined: Which games use the C71, C72, or C73 chips. Which games use the C77 (or higher numbered) chip. What we know so far is: C68  = System 2 (Final Lap 3, Suzuka 8 Hours) + System 21, C69  = NA-1 (World Court Tennis), C70  = NA-2 (Quiztou, Numan Athletics), C71  = System 22 (Master TMS32025 DSP BIOS), C72  = ?, C73  = Found on a test board, but used in any games?, C74  = System 22, C75  = NB-1 (Nebulas Ray) + NB-2 (Out Foxies) + System FL and C76  = System 11 (Xevious 3D/G). In the interim I've been examining the BIOS and working on a better trojan as well as figuring out how hardware on the MCU side works. So far adapting the NA-1 trojan for the C70 chip has not worked, but given the many similarities to C69 I feel a solution is not far off. It looks like all the System 2 games that have C68 do not use the external program ROM socket. Do any System 21 games use it, if such a socket is present? Updated the chip list based on information from Justin (thanks for the PCB pic!), Kayama, Fujix, Oliver, Guru and R. Belmont.
-  3rd January   2006: R. Belmont - Charles MacDonald has trojaned the MCU BIOS for Namco NA-1. Primarily this means correct emulated sound and music as opposed to the current (very good) simulation. I'm working on hooking everything up in MAME properly right now. And yes, this can also be considered proof of concept for trojaning other troublesome Namco MCUs (including System 11, 22, NB-1/NB-2, and FL) although the specific method won't quite apply.
-  2nd January   2006: Charles MacDonald - I've been running tests on the Namco NA-1 hardware over the last few days, and figured out how to dump the internal ROM of the M37702 MCU used in Super World Court. The BIOS has a function where code can be copied from the 68000 side over to MCU RAM and executed, making it quite insecure. I wrote a program that copies a portion of the M37702 memory to shared RAM, and the 68000 can change and run the program in a loop to read any part of the MCU address space. I think the same technique will work for other NA-1 games; at least what I've seen in MAME is that a number of them also upload code fragments for the MCU to use. For other types of Namco hardware that use the M37702, it's highly dependant on what services the MCU makes available. Also, now that the BIOS can be examined and user code can be executed on the MCU side for testing, maybe the NA-1 sound hardware (integrated in the multiple purpose 219 chip) will get figured out. Though the existing simulation of the NA-1 sound hardware is remarkably good.

Fixed so top 8 bits of X & Y are preserved when in 8-bit index mode. Fixed some disassembly errors. Added save state support. Added M37702 alias for documentation purposes.
- 12th February  2006: R. Belmont - I found the remaining M377xx core bug that was preventing System 22 games from using the dumped C74 BIOS. It's actually a difference from the 65C816: for anyone who's done any SNES hacking, you might find this interesting. Or not. Take this assembly program, which is the same on both processors (except the 7700 doesn't need the first two instructions - it has no 6502 emulation mode): CLC, XCE ; make sure we're in native mode - 65816 only, REP #$30 ; all registers to 16 bits, LDA #$0123, LDX #$4567, LDY #$89AB, SEP #$30 ; all registers to 8 bits and REP #$30 ; back to 16 again. Now, what are the 16-bit values of A, X, and Y at that point? On a real 65C816 (tested on an Apple IIgs) A is 0123, X is 0067, and Y is 00AB. On the M377xx (I can't test on one, but there's a routine at C881 in the C74 BIOS that makes this behavior extremely clear) A is 0123, X is 4567, and Y is 89AB. The upshot is that with this and some other fixes, the System 22 games (including Ace Driver!) now play music using their own real correct BIOSes. No more BAD DUMP and PR1DATA.8K tomfoolery.
-  4th February  2006: R. Belmont - The C74 BIOS for Namco's System 22 games is fun. And by 'fun' I mean (insert the Howard Dean scream here). It's found a few more lingering bugs in the M377xx core though, so that's always useful.
- 0.103u2            : M37710 fixes [R.Belmont]: Added another addressing mode for SBCB opcade. Fixed MPY to clear the carry flag.
- 0.101u1            : Some improvements to M37710 [cync].
- 0.100u4            : Updated 65816 and 37710 cores [R. Belmont]: Fixed both CPUs to set the data bank register to the destination on an MVN/MVP. Some minor tweeks so the debugger works properly when the 65816 is executing out of a read handler (as it always is for the SNES).
- 0.99u10            : Aaron Giles fixed interrupt problem in the M37710 core that caused problems with the recent Namco update.
- 0.99u9             : Major Namco sound improvements [R. Belmont]: Speed-cheated all instances of the M37710/C352 sound system so CPU requirements don't go up much. This also helped back off the requirements a hair for Prop Cycle and Time Crisis.
- 0.99u7             : Cync fixed several bugs in the Namco System 22 sound system (fixed interrupt update).
- 0.92               : R. Belmont fixed bug in M37710 cpu core.
- 26th January   2005: R. Belmont - Finishing the first pass of the Namco Super System 22 MCU integration, where the M37710 reads the controls.
- 0.86u4             : R. Belmont added support for M37710 externally-pulsed timers (Prop Cycle uses this to read the pedals).
- 0.86u2             : R. Belmont added M37710 analog and digital I/O port support (anyone know how to control PC case fans from software?  Prop Cycle's "fan" output is bit 1 of 37710 port 5). Added LDB absolute and DIV direct opcodes. Rewrote the RLA instruction. Pretty much everything was wrong with it including the result, flags and cycle count. Fixed disassembly for RLA.
- 0.86u1             : R. Belmont added M37710 opcodes ROR B, LDB direct indexed, MPY stack relative and DIV direct.
- 25th August    2004: R. Belmont - Got the M37710 talking to the 68020 in the Super System 22 games, so e.g. Prop Cycle now has music and sound effects. Now working out how the MCU reads the controls to eliminate more HLE hacks...
- 0.86               : M37710 improvements [R. Belmont]: Data bus is actually 16 bit, not 8. Fixed saving of status register on interrupts. Fixed errors in PHB, PHT, PLT, and ANDB opcodes. Added XAB, PLB, and ROLB opcodes. Fixed IRQ dispatch errors. Various get_info fixes.
- 21st August    2004: R. Belmont - Fixed a ton more bugs in the M37710 and submitted it.
- 19th August    2004: R. Belmont - Even more work on the M37710. Fixed a bunch of bugs and added 2 more opcodes so Prop Cycle is now happy, but Time Crisis is angry now instead.
- 18th August    2004: R. Belmont - Continued work on the M37710. Fixed data bus width to 16-bit (oops), added timer support, and fixed some obscure IRQ handling bugs. Result? It crashes when Prop Cycle tries to play a sound (grumble), but I do have some leads to chase when I'm less tired.
- 0.85u2             : Added m37710\m37710.c/h, m37710cm.h, m37710o0-3.c and m37710op.h. R. Belmont updated the Namco Super System 22 driver to use preliminary M37710 core, but it doesn't do anything useful yet.
- NOTES: Mitsubishi M37710 is based on the WDC 65C816 core, with the following notable changes: Second accumulator called "B" (on the 65816, "A" and "B" were the two 8-bit halves of the 16-bit "C" accumulator). 6502 emulation mode and XCE instruction are not present. No NMI line. BRK and the watchdog interrupt are non-maskable, but there is no provision for the traditional 6502/65816 NMI line. 3-bit interrupt priority levels like the 68000. Interrupts in general are very different from the 65816. New single-instruction immediate-to-memory move instructions (LDM) replaces STZ. CLM and SEM (clear and set "M" status bit) replace CLD/SED. Decimal mode is still available via REP/SEP instructions. INC and DEC (0x1A and 0x3A) switch places for no particular reason. The microcode bug that caused MVN/NVP to take 2 extra cycles per byte on the 65816 seems to have been fixed. The WDM (0x42) and BIT immediate (0x89) instructions are now prefixes. 0x42 when used before an instruction involving the A accumulator makes it use the B accumulator instead. 0x89 adds multiply and divide opcodes, which the real 65816 doesn't have. The various 7700 series models differ primarily by their on board peripherals. The 7750 and later models do include some additional instructions, vs. the 770x/1x/2x, notably signed multiply/divide and sign extension opcodes. Peripherals common across the 7700 series include: programmable timers, digital I/O ports, and analog to digital converters.

Renamed read/write functions. Readability cleanup in opcode table. Simplify branch code. Mem16/24bit accesses are word-aligned (not counting opcode args of course). More whitespace readability stuff. Cleanup and improved irqs. Added missing opcodes and 'illegal opcode'. Improved 8bit timers. Small update while trying to find a suspected opcode bug. Fixed addc subc zeroflag. Sort source layout.

- 31st January   2010: R. Belmont - I picked up Olivier Galibert's in-progress Panasonic MN10200 CPU core and am adapting it for MAME (he was debugging it in a standalone M1-like program). This is used to drive the music in Taito games such as Raystorm and Ray Crisis. WARNING: This does not mean there will be music in those games any time soon. The CPU core is not fully operational (interrupts are ad-hoc at best, the timers are not emulated, and there are probably buggy opcodes) and the ZOOM wavetable playback chip is not emulated. So all this is going to do near-term is make those games slower. This *is* MAME.

The Programmed Data Processor (PDP-1) is a high speed, solid state digital computer designed to operate with many types of input-output devices with no internal machine changes. It is a single address, single instruction, stored program computer with powerful program features. Five-megacycle circuits, a magnetic core memory and fully parallel processing make possible a computation rate of 100,000 additions per second. The PDP-1 is unusually versatile. It is easy to install, operate and maintain. Conventional 110-volt power is used, neither air conditioning nor floor reinforcement is necessary, and preventive maintenance is provided for by built-in marginal checking circuits. PDP-1 circuits are based on the designs of DEC's highly successful and reliable System Modules. Flip-flops and most switches use saturating transistors. Primary active elements are Micro-Alloy-Diffused transistors. The entire computer occupies only 17 square feet of floor space. It consists of four equipment frames, one of which is used as the operating station. The Central Processor contains the control, arithmetic and memory addressing elements, and the memory buffer register. The word length is 18 binary digits. Instructions are performed in multiples of the memory cycle time of five microseconds. Add, subtract, deposit and load, for example, are two-cycle instructions requiring 10 microseconds. Multiplication requires and average of 20 microseconds. Program features include: single address instructions, multiple step indirect addressing and logical arithmetic commands. Console features include: flip-flop indicators grouped for convenient octal reading, six program flags for automatic setting and computer sensing, and six sense switches for manual setting and computer sensing. The coincident-current, magnetic core memory of a standard PDP-1 holds 4096 words of 18 bits each. Memory capacity may be readily expanded, in increments of 4096 words, to a maximum of 65,536 words. The read-rewrite time of the memory is five microseconds, the basic computer rate. Driving currents are automatically adjusted to compensate for temperature variations between 50 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit. The core memory storage may be supplemented by up to 24 magnetic tape transports. PDP-1 is designed to operate a variety of buffered input-output devices. Standard equipment consistes of a perforated tape reader with a read speed of 400 lines per second, and alphanuermic typewriter for on-line operation in both input and output, and a perforated tape punch (alphanumeric or binary) with a speed of 63 lines per second. A variety of optional equipment is available.

21.J   SSEM

-  1st June      2009: MooglyGuy - If anyone wants to try it out, I just committed my CPU core and driver for the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), or "Baby", to the MESS SVN depot. It currently runs all known SSEM programs bundled with David Sharp's SSEM simulator, available here (http://www.davidsharp.com/baby/). I am not entirely happy with the fact that it is compatible with all of the programs, though. Certain programs in particular, i.e. "nightmare.snp", would not run on the SSEM had it ever been extended to the full 8192 words of storage space of which it was theoretically capable (per some SSEM history sites), as they pad out the unused 8 address bits with pretty patterns.
- 15th April     2009: MooglyGuy - I was rather intrigued by David Link's project (http://www.alpha60.de/research/muc/) to resurrect the Manchester Mark I, and commenced digging up more info about the Manchester Mark I and its predecessor, the Manchester Small Scale Experimental Machine, or "Baby". As it turns out, there's already a Java-based emulator out there. Inspiration struck, and I decided to see how easy it would be to emulate the SSEM in MESS. It was, historically, the first electronic stored-program computer (if I read my sources right), so it seems like a prime candidate for support in MESS. Without further ado, here is the Manchester Small Scale Experimental Machine displaying the results of Tom Kilburn's "Highest Common Factor for 989" program, including the correct answer (43). Chances are good I'll be able to get clearance to add this to MESS. Fingers crossed!

23.    Discrete Netlist

- 0.187              : Added Zaccaria driver to mamenl build [Couriersud].
- 0.186              : Added netlist\plib/pomp.h and netlist\devices\nld_schmitt.cpp/h. Changed Solver.PARALLEL parameter logic: 0 = Parallel processing of solvers disabled. 1 = One processor parallel processing. Can be used to measure OPENMP overhead. >1 = Solve n analog subnets in parallel. Previously, all available processors were used which caused performance to degrade on hyperthreading. Netlist refactoring: OPENMP refactored. All OPENMP operations are now templatized in pomp.h. We don't need thread-safe priority queue. Event code updating analog outputs now runs outside the parallel code. Reordered members to be more cache friendly (devices\nld_7493.cpp and nld_9316.cpp). Cleanup of solver code. Various code alignments across solvers. Added Cheeky Mouse to mamenl build. Fixed state saving for pfunction lfsr. Fixed debug assert in many drivers using netlist (netlist\nl_setup.cpp; atarittl.cpp, hazeltin.cpp, m62.cpp, mario.cpp and pong.cpp) [Couriersud].
- 0.185              : Turn psring iterator into a real forward iterator that works with standard algorithms. There are a few changes to achieve this: * Renamed to const_iterator since it's immutable. * Typedef iterator to const_iterator for now as there's no mutable iterator. * Added default constrcutor and operator-> required by concept, const-qualify operators. * Removed operator+ and operator+= since it's not a random-access iterator (use std::next and std::advance instead). * Return reference/pointer to a proxy rather than a code_t value from opertator*/operator->. The final change is required to meet the requirement that operator* for two equivalent forward iterators return an equivalent reference. The pstring doesn't actually contain a sequence of code_t, so there's no way to return a reference to code_t directly. Instead, a reference to a proxy object aliased on the string storage is returned. The proxy is implicitly convertible to code_t. The most noticeable side effect is that auto c = *s.begin() or for (auto c : s) won't work. You need to do for (auto &c : s) or for (code_t c : s) instead [Vas Crabb]. Changed pstring to use std::string as storage container. This removes all allocation code from pstring. const_iterator is consequently now based on pstring::const_iterator. Removed pstring_buffer. This was class wasn't a good idea. Vas was right: This change did not impact runtime performance. Startup performance (string intensive) increased. Use char32_t were appropriate. Fixed pedantic Clang warnings. pstring, pdynlib, pfmtlog refactoring: pstring: Added support for UTF16LE to pstring. Renamed size() to mem_t_size(). Renmaed len() to length(). Added size() == length(). Added empty(). Added simple compare(). pfmtlog: Simplified pfmtlog, added more C++. pdynlib: Added a dynproc type to dynlib to wrap dynamic library calls. Various: Fixed two coverty scan issue. Various Clang warnings fixed. Netlist code refactoring: More use of C++ features. Some CRTP in pfmtlog. Demangled code for truthtables. Use more constexpr. Rewrote main loop. Use default constructors and assignment operators were applicable. Optimized 7448 and 9316. All of this has decreased startup time by approx. 25% to 30%. Complex netlists like pong or kidniki are parsed, analyzed and constructed in around 15 ms. Run performance has increased by about 5%. All in all not to bad. A game like pong uses a clock of 7 MHz (after division by 2). Thats 14 MHz clock invocations. Running at over 200%, 28MHz. On a 3.9 GHz Machine about 140 cycles/clock change. Refactored 74715 to one device layout. Removed subdevice. Parametrized device activation in truthtables and minor optimization (devices\nlid_truthtable.h) [Couriersud].
- 0.184              : Slightly improved event timing if state changes. Also introduce a push_force call to reschedule already pending events if the state will not change. Clean up net_t interface and increase readability. Improved readability. Added more C++11 noexcept and swap semantics. Also fixed Clang-5 warnings and VS2015 compile. Added a heap priority queue to the netlist source. This is currently not used since performance drops by about 40%. The typical use case would be circuits a lot more complex than those we currently emulate where the 2*log(n) advantage really applies. Fixed netlist stats collection. Code refactoring: Small improvement for 7493. Converted 9316 from subdevice to delegate. Converted 74107 from subdevice style to delegate. Also refactored inconsistencies in other parts of the code. Netlist refactoring: Align timed_queue closer to std::priority_queue. Use uint8_t in extended clock for better memory usage. Minor changes to nl_breakout.cpp. Fixed some Cppcheck and Clang warnings. Fixed -Winconsistent-missing-destructor-override warnings. Made some constructors of template classes and classes with virtual .. = 0 methods protected. Fixed openmp compile (solver\nld_solver.cpp) [Couriersud].
- 0.183              : Added netlist\analog\nlid_fourterm.h, nlid_twoterm.h, netlist\buildVS\netlist.sln, netlistlib.vcxproj, netlistlib.vcxproj.filters, netlistlib.vcxproj.user, nltool.vcxproj, nltool.vcxproj.filters, netlist\netlist_types.h, nld_74164.cpp/h, machine\nl_prodigy.cpp/h and layout\prodigy.lay. Changed nld_fourterm.cpp to nlid_fourterm.cpp, nld_twoterm.cpp to nlid_twoterm.cpp, and nld_truthtable.cpp/h to nlid_truthtable.cpp/h. Added infix notation parsing to the function parser. Netlist refactoring: Refactored netlist pmf code. Small optimization for diode calculations. Minor refactoring across the board. Removed virtual from some destructors and make them protected. Various cleanups. Small performance improvement. Fixed some inconsistencies. More C++ refactoring. Fixed netlist code generation. Fixed compile on some unknown compiler (netlist\plib\pstring.cpp) and Visual Studio (plib\pfunction.cpp). Cleanup of includes. Fixed warning about non existing memory space when netlist is used as an additional cpu. Fixed bug which caused (MESS) Hazeltine 1500 to crash. Reduced overhead to load data (roms) in netlist significantly. The previous solution involved a significant amount of redundant replication of information and objects. Now, a rom name specified as SOMEROM(x21, "romlabel") will automatically be loaded from region "netlisttag:romlabel". Examples are (MESS) Hazeltine 1500 and Stunt Cycle [TTL]. Fixed a hidden bug in the GMRES solver and more optimization. Logging enhancement: For netlist device debugging one can now use #define LOG(...) log().info(__VA_ARGS__) to use debugging and the known #define LOG(...) do {} while (0) do disable debugging on device level. To avoid bitrot one could as well use #define LOG(...) log().info.log<true>(__VA_ARGS__) and #define LOG(...) log().info.log<false>(__VA_ARGS__). The later disables debugging. If the compiler can assume that there are no side effects from e.g. using foo(a/b), 'LOG("abc {1:04x}", foo(a/b));' should be completely optimized away. Log channels available are info, verbose, warning, error and fatal. Don't use debug, it is enabled only on specific debug builds. Use would be e.g. LOG("abc {1:04x}", 2); The format specifier in the string are enclosed in "{}". "{2}" is the second parameter after the format string. Types are determined automatically. "{3:04x}" would format a number as a hexadecimal with 4 leading zeros. Rewroted mat_cr_t to include data as well. Fixed some bitrot in other parts. Simplified solver creation. Separated include file usage for netlist. Device implementations (all cpp files in netlist/devices) now should only include nl_base.h. Netlist implementation sources should only include "net_lib.h". Refactored netlist.h and netlist.cpp to avoid namespace congestion in netlist.h. Fixed VC2015 build. Fixed crashes on terminals without nets (i.e. connected to a rail). Reviewed "FIXMEs" and corrected some minor ones. Made m_cur_analog protected. Fixed pmf delegates to work with MSVC. More optimizations to the solver code. Started work on a better signal pipeline in nlwav. Only generate documentation for entities which are documented. Some documentation work. Set default models for devices missing them. Fixed standalone makefile to work in mingw environment. Doxygen work. Added constexpr and noexcept. Fixed 9322. It is now possible to have multiple handlers per device for updates. This will make device implementation more flexible and faster. A nice side-effect is that there was some minor (<5%) performance increase already. Each input is now assigned a notification handler. Currently this is update, but going forward this may be a custom handler. In addition: Fixed MEMPOOL on OSX. Removed dead code. Avoid bit-rot. Added delegate support for emscripten and arm processors. Added delegate support for VS 2015 x64. Make sure netlist includes are not found directly on include path. Instead, they have to be prefixed by "netlist/". Removed unneeded link librariers for nltool and nlwav along the way. Make windows builds of nltool and nlwav understand unicode. nltool and nlwav now use wmain, i.e. UNICODE main on windows. Reorder include order to comply with best practices. Added state saving and loading to nltool. Save states are needed for regression tests going forward. Added standalone VC2015 build file in lib\netlist\build. This was the last platform without standalone compile. Sure needs more attention, grateful for any help. Moved inline constructors from header to cpp. Moved from <cstring> to std::copy and friends. Optimized 7493 device. Gives some 5 to 10% improvement to Pong. 7493 also is an example on how to use multiple handlers on a device makes design easier. Reworked Netlist truthtables: Moved 9312 and 74279 to TTL macro library. Renamed TTL_9312_* to DM9312. This is more appropriate. Fixed a number of warnings from latest Ubuntu Clang-5.0 [Couriersud]. Explicitly #include C++ headers for features use [h3xx, Vas Crabb]. Added 74164 (8bit parallel output serial shift register). Added BCD display netlist for (MESS) Prodigy chess computer [Joakim Larsson Edstrom].
- 0.182              : Added netlist\devices\nlid_proxy.cpp/h, macro\nlm_base.cpp/h, plib\pexception.cpp/h, plib\pfunction.cpp/h, solver\nld_matrix_solver.cpp and netlist\nl_errstr.h. Added LM747, LM747A and 2N2565 [Vas Crabb]. Roms now specify an identifier in the netlist. The identifier is used to load data from a source_t implementation. This allos a consistent approach in netlists independent of netlist implementation. Both sources code and parameter code needed quite some rewrite to support this. Fixed nullptr exception and loading roms in two devices. Added "-r" option to nltool to pass path to a folder containing rom files. Multiple "-r" options may be given. Zip files are not supported, just individual files. Fixed bug in 74123. Make Mario Bros. sound netlist compiling again. Fixed 74629 and some internals. Moved proxy code into separate file. Some preparation for future changes on proxies and chip families. Analog to digital proxy rework. Properly handle connected inputs when creating a-d proxy. Aligned a-d proxy to d-a proxy class structure. Align noexcept usage. Rename register_con to add_terminal for clearity. Changed cstr() ==> c_str(). Hook up Luigi walking sound in netlist mario sound implementation. Mario driver now uses netlist audio implementation instead of discrete implementation. The previous discrete sound emulation has not been removed yet because it still contains a lot of documentation. Simplify code. Introduced consistent approach to loading macro devices. Changed nltool "listdevices" command accordingly. Fixed some bugs which surfaced by this exercise. Refactored factory. Use namespace "factory" instead of prefix factory_ all over the place. Fixed parsing of macro devices. Update to input definition file (nl_examples\congo_bongo.csv): Create congo bongo sounds with ./nltool -c run -t 10 -i nl_examples/congo_bongo.csv -f nl_examples/congo_bongo.c -l RO.1 and convert to wav with ./nlwav -i log_RO.1.log -o t.wav. Sounds played are: GORILLA, BASS_DRUM,CONGA_H, CONGA_L, RIM0 and again GORILLA. Added FREQ parameter to MM5837 noise generator. Specs in datasheet range from 24000 Hz to 56000 Hz. Properly use VDD for output reference voltage. Fixed pin assignment 4001. Added SIGFPE enabling code to plib\pexception.*. Moved plib exceptions into these files as well. The code uses <cfenv> which is part of C++11 standard. Non-standard glib extensions are currently only used on linux and (i386 or x86_64). Fixed some pedantic Clang warnings. Fixed Clang "-Wno-weak-vtables" warnings in netlist source. Refactored code along the way. Make destructors virtual on base classes. intX_fast_t may depend on compiler implementation and thus is not suited for save states. Fixed startup when there are no timestep devices present, i.e. capacitors or inductors. Removed parameter GS_THRESHOLD and misleading solver parameters. It is now outdated. Make stop be called again. Fixed METHOD parameter. No need for a virtual stop which is needed only by the solver. Reduced memory footprint for parameters. Moved netlists into macro folder. nlwav now accepts stdin and stdout: cat log_RO.1.log | ./nlwav | play -. Removed gnd() method. Fixed potential reset and initialization issues. Fixed timing issue in CD4538. Added "pow" (power) to the function model. Added code to remove devices connected only to rail terminals. Prepare source for consistent error message usage. Introduce a more structured approach to models. Added more documentation to diode and bjt model. Moved analog devices into "netlist::analog" namespace. Added documentation to opamp model. Preparation work for automatically generated include file for devices. nltool now is able to create all defines from the factory definitions. This will reduce the number of places needed to touch when adding devices and always ensure that the parser and statically compiled netlist code use the same syntax. This will enable us to delete most device include files, e.g. nld_74107.h. Netlist usage to create this header file: ./nltool -c header > src\lib\netlist\devices\nld_devinc.h. This is not yet used in production. It will be enabled after additional tests. Keep track were registry elements are created. Register all devices using NETLIB_DEVICE_IMPL. Fixed encoding issue. Refactored reverse polish notation evaluator into own source files. Added function parameter to current and voltage sources VS and CS. You can now use those to e.g. produce a sine wave. Changed code to allow devices to optionally be treated as dynamic or timestepping devices. Converted warnings and fatal log messages to constants. Also refactored some code to ease the exercise. Default argument on plib::environment now optional. Assume string literals are UTF8 in netlist code. At the same time, any char pointer has to be explicitly converted to pstring by specifying an encoding. Not yet optimal, but certainly better than what was there before. Removed unneeded methods from pstring. Make streams provide binary access only. Use putf8_reader and putf8_writer to actually access streams. Replace some char * parameters with pstring where appropriate. Minor code refactoring and move functionality were it belongs [Couriersud]. Added skeleton drivers to nl.lst (commented out) [Stiletto].
- 0.181              : Added netlist\devices\nld_2102A.cpp/h, nld_2716.cpp/h, nld_4316.cpp/h, nld_74161.cpp/h, nld_74165.cpp/h, nld_74166.cpp/h, nld_74174.cpp/h, nld_74194.cpp/h, nld_74365.cpp/h, nld_7473.cpp/h, nld_7475.cpp/h, nld_7485.cpp/h, nld_82S115.cpp/h, nld_82S123.cpp/h, nld_82S126.cpp/h, nld_9322.cpp/h, nld_am2847.cpp/h, nld_dm9334.cpp/h, nld_tristate.cpp/h, nl_examples\diode.c, norton_opamp.c, rc.c and rl.c. Added simple ROM hookup capability. Device additions: 74161 Synchronous 4-Bit Binary Counter with Clock. 7473 Dual Master-Slave J-K Flip-Flops with Clear and Complementary Outputs. Am2847 Quad 80-bit Static Shift Register. DM9334 8-bit Addressable Latch. 82S126 1K-bit bipolar PROM device. 74174 Hex D-Type Flip-Flop with Clear. 2716 16 Kbit (2048x8) UV EPROM. 74166 Parallel-Load 8-Bit Shift Register device. 74260 Dual 5-Input NOR Gate device. Intel 2102A 1Kbit (1024 x 1) Static RAM. 74365 Hex Bus Driver with 3-State Outputs. Generic 2- and 3-terminal Tristate device. Note: Tristate device and 74365 do not actually tristate, they are simply a way of combining multiple outputs + chip enables. Added shared RAM pointer, for use by netlist RAM devices which need updating by non-netlist driver code. Various fixes: 7473: Made device only transition on a falling clock. 74161: Inverted Clear and Clock inputs to match datasheet. 74260: Fixed number of inputs. Am2847: Fixed shift register size (was 160 bits, should have been 80 bits). DM9334: Inverted C and E inputs to match datasheet. Added netlist-based video board emulation to (MESS) Hazeltine 1500. Added 74165, 74194, 7475, 7485 and DM9322 devices. Added 82S126 4kbit (512x8) TTL bipolar PROM. Added 82S123 256-bit (32x8) TTL bipolar PROM [Ryan Holtz]. Added uA741 in 8-, 10- and 14-pin DIP variants (netlist\macro\nlm_opamp.cpp). Added 4316 bilateral switch pack [Vas Crabb]. Added inductor to netlist and some files to nl_examples. Fixed 74107 and 74107A timings to typical values. Leave more comments on differences between 74107 and 74107A. Added proper connection information for a number of chips to net_lib.cpp. This allows to parse and run (MESS) nl_hazelvid.cpp using nltool: nltool -t 1 -f nl_hazelvid.cpp [Couriersud].
- 0.180              : Fix up pstring code: Instantiate static constant members for ODR context. Declare static members of template classes properly. Declare external template instantiations. Fixed blind use of autocomplete ("treats" really?). Fixed ptype_traits on platforms where char is unsigned. Signed char is never an alias for char even if char is signed. Even if eclipse doesn't like using type, surely it supports typedef [Vas Crabb].
- 0.177              : Minor include cleanup. Fixed a memory hole caused by assign operators. More C++. Added doc target to netlist makefile. Removed old style cast. Use noexcept in netlist code where appropriate. Use macro NL_NOEXCEPT if debug builds would throw an exception (e.g. by using nl_assert). This is not entirely safe. Going forward, nl_assert should call log first and than throw. Fixed noexcept and NL_NOEXCEPT to pass g++ 6.x builds. Added target mingw to standalone netlist makefile. Added a preliminary parser for RINF netlist format [Couriersud].
- 0.176              : Added netlist\build\doxygen.conf, netlist\documentation/doc.css, mainpage.dox.h, primer_1.dox.h, structure.dox.h and test1-50r.svg. nltool now accepts -Ddefine=value to pass on to netlists. Improved option handling and added "dummy" options to add grouping and examples in help output. Improved --cmd=listdevices output. Fixed dynamic timestepping. This will work with breakout using real capacitor modelling instead of delay devices. Really slow, but very useful to calibrate timings. Fixed an awful bug in timing for delay devices. Switched to Clang 3.8 and made code compile with -Weverything -Werror -Wno-old-style-cast -Wno-padded -Wno-weak-vtables. -Wno-missing-variable-declarations -Wno-conversion -Wno-c++98-compat. -Wno-float-equal -Wno-cast-align -Wno-global-constructors. -Wno-c++98-compat-pedantic -Wno-exit-time-destructors. -Wno-format-nonliteral -Wno-weak-template-vtables. This was a helpful exercise since it brought forward some serious issues with implicit constructors. Added more RAII and improved exceptions. Fixed some bugs in parser code. Removed trampolines (OUTLOGIC, INPLOGIC and friends). Started using doxygen comment and documentation style. Added doxygen files to documentation folder. Refactored code triggered by doxygen output. Moved internal and support classes into namespace detail. Use an anordered map in parser. -Wconversion fixes - All done now. Fixed -Wold-style-cast warnings in netlist code. Added iterators to pstring. Moved two macros, added more RAII and improved exceptions. Fixed some bugs in parser code. Fixed a number of bugs in parser code and exception handling [Couriersud]. Fix for netlist library when built for WINDOWS with UNICODE defined (netlist\plib\pdynlib.cpp). When UNICODE is defined LoadLibrary is redefined to LoadLibraryW which expects a widechar string as library name, while libname is always UTF8. Fixed copying TCHAR conversion code from strconv.cpp since netlist is meant to be also a stand-alone library [Giuseppe Gorgoglione].
- 0.175              : Added netlist\devices\nlid_cmos.h, nlid_system.h and netlist\plib\putil.cpp/h. Removed netlist\nl_util.h and netlist\devices\nld_cmos.h. Moved all parameter definitions in constructors. Make netlist compile with C++11, use own implementation of make_unique to avoid C++14. Removed dependency on osd_ticks. Converted palloc and friends into templates. Moved code into separate plib namespace. Stop using underscore _names, they're reserved for compiler/system. Minor cosmetic refactoring. Added a "uninitialised array" template to allow in-place creation (for increased locality) of netlist classes. Main use is in truthtable class. Removed PLIB_NAMESPACE macros. Removed namespace macros. Use explicit namespace declarations. Moved device definitions into cpp files. Moved more device definitions into cpp files. New prefix "nlid" for include files flags purely internal include files not to be leaked into userland. Fixed factory code. Added constructors to prepare to move terminal setup into constructor. Reworked twoterm setup. Fixed some timebombs along the way. Fixed r2r dac. Remove dead code. analog_outputs now created in constructor. Moved analog_input creation into constructor. Moved logic output creation to constructor. Moved all logic inputs into constructor. Completely removed init_object - finally. More code cleanup: Dead code removal and minor refactoring. Simplify. Align naming with stl. Fix somed pedantic warnings. More STL compatability. Removed ATTR_HOT and ATTR_COLD. Refactored netlist_time. Fixed long standing workaround which would ignore policy of change-only" propagation. Rewroted for loops to use auto : semantics. Truthtable cleanup. Get rid of nl_math. Remove nl_util.h and moved contents to plib/putil.h. Fixed standalone build. Refactor ptypes.h. Merged netlist_dev branch, all code_refactoring: Object model optimisation. Merged remote-tracking branch 'origin/master' into netlist_dev. Default PHAS_PMF_INTERNAL=0 for 32bit windows mingw. Changed UINT8 to uint_[fast|least|8_t. Moved state_var so it can be used by base devices as well. Removed last traces of ATTR_ALIGN. Refactored netlist_time into a template. Removed implicit double assignment to netlist. Doomed to produce bugs. Instead, use netlist_time::from_double. Switch to using proper (i.e. bool type) param_logic_t. Formally differentiate between logic inputs (e.g. switches) and int inputs (e.g. resistor ladders or selection switches). Added parameter USE_DEACTIVATE to truthtable devices. Added more constexpr to netlist_time. Fixed some ifdef code paths. More C++. Simplify main processing loop. As a nice side-effect that squeezed out some cycles. More cycle squeezing. Removed pvector_t. Use std::sort. Refactored netlist state manager. Introduction of state_var object template to be used on device state members. Changed remaining save occurrences to state_var. Rewrote nltool's listdevices command. This allowed removal of one member from devices which served solely for listdevices. Remove hashmap_t. Fixed kidniki regression. Replaced shared_ptr by unique_ptr. Better seperation of setup_t and netlist_t. Fixed bugs in rdtsc code. Refactored timer code. Simplify conditional activation/deactivation. Introduced HINT(device, hint) to clarify that hints are inheritent  and not specific to devices. Added improved profiling support to netlist. Statistics output now proposes devices for which whole device activation/deactivation be disabled. No significant improvement for pong, but breakout experiences a 10% improvement. Moved options code from include to cpp file. Minor modifications to 7493 and 9316. Introduced perftime_t and perfcount_t for gathering statistics. These templates do not create any code if statistics are not kept. Make help2man ./nltool produce usuable output. More truthtable refactoring. Removed half-finished code for internal state support. As implemented, this would have had no support for timing delays. Added explicit to constructors to avoid bad surprises later. Srcclean on netlist files. Avoid the merge massacre [Couriersud].
- 0.174              : Removed netlist\devices\nld_7402.cpp/h, nld_7404.cpp/h, nld_7408.cpp/h, nld_7410.cpp/h, nld_7411.cpp/h, nld_7420.cpp/h, nld_7430.cpp/h, nld_7425.cpp/h, nld_7427.cpp/h, nld_7432.cpp/h, nld_7437.cpp/h, nld_7486.cpp/h and nld_signal.h. Converted most subdevices to unique_ptr. This is a temporary measure until the device initialisation is moved into the constructor. Started converting constructors of devices to be passed name and netlist. Implemented 7402, 7404, 7408, 7410, 7411, 7420, 7425, 7427, 7430, 7432, 7437 and 7486 as macro device. Removed nld_signal.h since netlist devices no longer use it. Some minor changes towards C++11. Simplify object model by removing default_logic_family(). Added Mario Bros. to MAMENL target (mame\nl.lst). Renamed connect_direct to connect_post_start to reflect usage. Align object registration syntax. A step towards late creation of devices. Code simplification. Don't include netlist name in device names (netlist\nl_setup.cpp). Devices are now created after the netlist was parsed. This enables us going forward to move everything in start() into the constructor and get a much cleaner object model. Some use of share_ptr to ease memory management. More automatic memory handling. Continuing work to move object initialization from start to constructor. Removed family_t. All of this can be determined at runtime from object as well. As part of this, the "template" to write devices has changed. Converted a number of devices to use the new template. Improved memory handling in factories. More memory timebombs removed. All netlist devices now follow new syntax. Removed dead code. All sub devices are now forced to be initialized in the constructor. Device setup now completely in constructor. Removed start call [Couriersud].
- 0.173              : Added netlist\plib\pdynlib.cpp/h and netlist\solver\nld_ms_gcr.h. Visual Studio 2015 netlist fix (src\netlist.lua and solver\nld_ms_w.h) [dankan1890]. Added m62(kidniki) to nl.lua. Started some experiments around parallel solving of linear equations. This code is not active. Fixed Kid Niki audio performance. Minor changes, mostly signed comparisons and adding includes for dependency documentation. Solver model simplification. Use C++11 features to use more templates. Use templates in nl_math. Replaced macros with templates (netlist\nl_base.h and plib\pstate.h). Get rid of some init_object calls. netlist_t no longer descends from netlist::object_t. Moved solver members to proper place. Minor code changes. Recover from creating solvers by copy paste. Significant speed improvement: Added a new solver using compressed row format. Fixed sorting. As a result, netlist performance on kidniki nearly doubled. The performance increase is mainly due to the fact that sorting decreases the number of operations for gaussian elimination of the kidniki matrix from ~7800 to 707. In addition, compressed row format improves L1 usage. Simplify solver infrastructure. Implemented dynamic loading of precompiled solver code [Couriersud]. Fixed type mismatch in netlist\solver\nld_solver.cpp. This fixed OpenMP-enabled builds fail to compile MT#06170 [Jindrich Makovicka].
- 0.172              : Added netlist\solver\nld_ms_sm.h and solver\nld_ms_w.h. First steps to move towards C++11. Base plist on std::vector. Replaced pstack with std::stack. Removed pnamed_list. Use c++ "for each" in a number of places. Fixed two "time bombs". Removed GCC pragmas. These caused problems with MS compiler. Renamed plist_t to pvector_t to clarify origin. Some code simplification. Netlist code maintenance: Renamed netlist_analog_t to analog_t. Straighten object model. Reduced access to member variables. Use pvector<analog_net_t::list_t> for groups. Simple Coverity (software) fixes. Prepared code so that matrices can be allocated in one chunk of memory. Fixed Kid Niki sound speed. Make more class members private. Simply solver code. Removed ATTR_HOT from solver code. Make virtual members protected. More code optimization. Hide matrix_solver_t implementation. Use netlist_time for time deltas. Fixed pivoting and float usage. First version of Sherman-Morrison solver + some notes. Fixed crash in stat output when no calculations were run. Added Woodbury solver. Removed sorting from Sherman-Morrison solver. It doesn't help [Couriersud]. Use std::atomic in netlist\nl_lists.h with OpenMP [Vas Crabb].
- 0.171              : Added a BC548 transistor model (netlist\devices\net_lib.cpp). Make Zaccaria 1B11142 sound board a device in preparation for netlist sound. Moved Zaccaria 1B11107 board into audio\zaccaria.cpp so it can share common stuff with 1B11142 [Vas Crabb].
- 0.169              : Made netlist compile as separate without C++11 or higher deps requested by Couriersud [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.168              : Fixed typo in scripts\src\netlist.lua [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.166              : Added netlist\plib\pfmtlog.c/h and ptypes.h. Some pedantic netlist changes. Moved netlist from emu to lib. Removed last traces of printf from plib. Reorganized some code [Couriersud].
- 0.165              : Added netlist\build\makefile and netlist\plib\pstream.c/h. Improved MB3614 parameters. Changed some opamps to type "idealized" (type 1) in Congo Bongo netlist and got 50% speed improvement. Added simple stream classes to netlist code. Added emu\netlist to include dirs to avoid relative paths in netlist include files. Removed relative paths in include statements. More usage of streams and aligned exception use. utf8 support for pstring. Opted for a scalable solution which should be easily extensible to utf16 and utf32 as well. All position related operations now operate on char code positions instead of byte positions. Make netlist more typesafe. Added a pformat class to reduce sprintf usage. The approach is also suitable for translated strings with arbitrary positioning of parameters. Removed vsscanf from netlist. Changed default format for double to "g". Changed UINT16 - UINT64 to generic types in pformat. Some netlist_time maintenance. Straightened code using it and added support for 128 bit resolution on systems supporting it. This is however disabled since all platforms I know don't have native support but emulate 128 bit. Converted USE_PIVOT into runtime option PIVOT. Fixed some issues for nl_double == float. Increase performance from 53% to 69% for matrix size around 30x30. These matrices are e.g. used in Congo Bongo without optimisation. Created a separate logging class. Netlist code should now be at least 98% type safe. No more fuzzing around with SIZEFMT and friends. Changed formatting to use python style format strings. . Moved nltool.c and nlwav.c into netlist\prg. Added netlist\build\makefile. This allows netlist to be ripped out of the tree and to compile it standalone [Couriersud].
- 0.164              : Added netlist\devices\nld_mm5837.c/h, netlist\macro\nlm_cd4xxx.c/h, nlm_other.c/h, nlm_opamp.c/h, nlm_ttl74xx.c/h, nl_examples\congo_bongo.c, congo_bongo.csv, mm5837_noise.c, vs_cs.c and tools\nlwav.c. Code maintenance. In addition, added a parameter to select iterative solver. Fixed UTF-8 conversion (netlist\solver\mat_cr.h and netlist\tools\nl_convert.c). Disable "-Wmaybe-unitialized" warnings (netlist\solver\vector_base.h). Improved Kid Niki sound quality while maintaining speed by adding more frontiers. Added LOGIC_INPUT to netlist which allows to specify a logic family, i.e. output characterics. Used this for improved AY8910 port modeling. Netlist now compiles with -std=c++98 -Wall -Wpedantic -Wextra -Wno-long-long -Wno-variadic-macros and -std=c++11 -Wall -Wpedantic -Wextra. Added Voltage source and Current source to netlist. Added macro object registration and dynamic includes to netlist. This allows the creation of macro libraries going forward. Any IC which can be described by a truthtable and a package wrapper can now be entirely described in netlist syntax. Identify size_t usage in printf by enclosing the argument in SIZET_PRINTF(). This is typesafe, can be identified and allows to use proper 64bit computing with compilers up to it. Added CD4538. Added MM5837 Noise Generator used by Congo Bongo (nl_examples\congo_bongo.c and mm5837_noise.c). Fixed issues with GCC4.0 mentioned by Barry. Added two more models to netlist: OPAMP: Generic opamp model. This does all the annoying calculations. Just pass the the datasheet values. LVCCS: A limited current voltage control current source. This will allow slew rate limiting going forward. Added a (small) parallel conductance to all capacitors to improve convergence. Some initial work to use "long double". Created macro libraries for CD4XXX and 74XX chip families. Going forward, these will contain all devices which can be described using truthtables and DIPPINS. Align naming conventions of CD4XXX series. Moved CD4000/CD4020 DIP definitions to macro lib. Added macro library for opamp models. Added a phashmap_t object for faster lookups. Aligned builtin device identification with parser device identification. Changed phashmap_t to dynamically resize hash table. Use hashmap for factory searches. Changed case for parameter "model" to uppercase to align with rest of code. Added quiet flag to nltool. More phashmap_t usage. Quite some nice effect on larger netlist startup time. Hash objects can now deal with arbitrary hash width. Consolidate the scattered model parsing code. Now models support recursive models, e.g. DIODE("1N914(IS=1e-15)"). Removed ".model" from model definitions. Added nlwav to tools. nlwav converts netlist logs into wav files. Example usage: "nlwav -i netlist.log_RO.1.log -o tt.wav" and  "nlwav -h". Added a input control file for Congo Bongo netlist. This file is a standard csv file specifing times and values of parameter modifications for specified devices. This file triggers the various sound inputs using a 10ms impulse. Use "nltool -f nl_examples/congo_bongo.c -t 8 -l RO.1 -i nl_examples/congo_bongo.csv" to create a netlist log file of the Congo Bongo mixer stage. Use "nlwav -i netlist.log_RO.1.log -o tt.wav -a 17000" to create a wav file tt.wav from the log file using an amplification factor of 17000. Moved MC14584B to netlist\macro\nlm_other.c/h. Added macro models of LM324 and LM358. Made Kid Niki use those (audio\irem.c). Fixed a buffer overflow in sound\discrete.c [Couriersud]. Fixed build without OpenMP (netlist\solver\vector_base.h) [Balrog]. Fixed GCC 4.6 compile (solver\vector_base.h) [Dirk Best].
- 0.163              : Added netlist\solver\mat_cr.h, nld_ms_gmres.h, vector_base.h, netlist\tools\nl_convert.h and nl_examples\kidniki.c. Removed netlist\analog\nld_ms_jakobi.h. Moved all files in src\emu\netlist starting with p into plib folder. This is a first step to ease synchronisation with a stand alone, e.g. outside mame, netlist implementation. More signed/unsigned cleanups and started work on generic truthtable devices. Introduced user definable truth tables: This enables the addition of devices without changing the netlist source code and allows the creation of libraries. Used pong.c as a proof of concept for the time being. Got truthtable parsing working in the parser. The plib preprocessor now defines __PLIB_PREPROCESSOR__. This can be checked in netlist code and allows even more sharing code between compiled (embedded) netlists and external netlists. Use netlist().log() for logging instead of printf. This avoids the printf issue with I64u (aka SIZETFMT) on win builds. Added first version of a eagle to netlist converter. Commit omitted nl_convert.h. Renamed "find" to find_by_name inH pnamed_list for clarity. Fixed OpenMP by using spinlocks in push_to_queue. However no observable performance improvement. Without OpenMP, locks will not be compiled. Removed a couple of inlines and added consts were appropriate. Netlist now uses the same approach as delegate.h to derive member function pointers. If the platform doesn't support this approach, virtual function calls will be used. In addition, this commit contains modifications for standalone compile. delegate.h now supports mingw 32 bit builds with INTERNAL configuration. Member functions are called in this case using __thiscall ABI. Code maintenance. Removed commented out directives. Fixed save states in netlist. Converted netlist into a library. Moved most code from nl_convert.h to nl_convert.c. Targets using netlist must now specify this explicitly with MACHINES["NETLIST"] = true. Added subtarget "nl" which only contains games with netlist elements. Found some cycles by removing static declarations in some functions. Changed the way NETLIST_START(NAME) is located and called. This is done now solely by using a netlist_sources_t class. Netlist users just register sources like memregions, hardcoded strings, compiled netlists. Going forward this enables to eventually put macro model librariers into roms. The improvement comes with a price. Compiled netlists to be included must now be registered using LOCAL_SOURCE. Fixed proxy savestates, solver savestates, 7490 both counts firing at the same time and changed timed list to be resizable. Fixed bugs in the spice(Kicad) conversion. Fixes submodel difference between inline and parsed netlist. Added truthtable 7404 and 7486 models. Aligned input and output naming for truthtable and specialised 74xx models. Made it more convenient to add frontiers (impedance barriers). These - at the right place - enable netlist to split a netlist into multiple smaller netlists. Side mark: The "old" discrete system assumed such a device in every node. From 45% to 60% to 99%. That's the improvement achieved for a 89x89 audio matrix mostly solved by elimination. Cleaned up some code as well. Fixed a bug in the SOR solvers. Added a GMRES solver to netlist. The generalized minimal residual method ist certainly more modern than Gaussian elimination and Gauss-Seidel. However, more the current maximum matrix (KidNiki, 89x89) a combination of Gauss-Seidel to solve for maximum one step to catch quasi-stable conditions and fall-back to optimized Gaussian elimination (for sparse matrix) outperforms GMRES by up to 100%. Netlist code now uses "namespace netlist". At the same time, moved all devices int netlist::devices namespace. Completely integrated the GMRES solver into netlist solver templates and recoded it from scratch. GMRES now runs at 122% (kidniki), that's a real improement from 60% before. AT the same time, the code should be easier to read and closer to the GMRES algorithm. Ultimately, kidniki will not use this solver but instead use some frontiers to keep it playable. But going forward, for larger matrices this solver is an opton. Moved solver code into own folder. Fixed reset for proxy devices. In addition, documented how to achieve a reliable voltage stop criteria in gmres solver [Couriersud]. Fixed compile on MSVC (struct and string in struct had same name) (tools\nl_convert.c) [Peter Ferrie]. Added Kid Niki sound board netlist to nl_examples. Currently the netlist boils down to a 87x87 matrix. This is due to a total of 6 opamps which all are submodels and thus add their own internal nets. Gauss Seidel iterative solving comes to it's limits. nltool runs this at about 50% speed on my machine. Given the complexity this is quite good. Yet, any M62 game currently will not be playable [Andrew Gardner, Couriersud].
- 0.162              : Added devices\nld_truthtable.c, netlist\analog\nld_ms_jakobi.h, nld_ms_sor.h and nld_ms_sor_mat.h. Removed nld_ms_gauss_seidel.h. Don't call outside of netlist in case of noise introduced by solver. Optimized nld_74175.c, nld_82S16.c and nld_9316.c netlist devices. Added LED models. Fixed a bug in the solver code (netlist\analog\nld_solver.c). Minor speed improvements and some timing adjustments (devices\nld_74175.c, nld_74192.c, nld_82S16.c, nld_9310.c, nld_9316.c and drivers\nl_breakout.c). Some class structure cleanup (devices\nld_system.h, nl_base.c/h and nl_setup.c). Improved 9312 device ==> 20% speed increase. Removed netlist_state_t ==> no added value. Removed dead code in solver. Various minor modifications. Performance monitoring now also displays stats for subdevices. Fixed save-state issues and save state in 9312. Added EXTCLOCK which can generate arbitrary timing patterns. Use two EXTCLOCKs to replace timing circuit (9316) in Breakout. This gives a speed increase from 60% to 75%. Cleanup of the solver system. Moved all experimental stuff into nld_ms_sor_mat.h to have a production solver. Renamed Gauss-Seidel to SOR since it is actually a SOR with omega = 1. Separated matrix and right-hand-side calculation. Aligned register_sub to follow the same calling convention as other register_* calls. Aligned logic_family usage across objects. Fixed timing of DICE compatibility capacitor delay (netlist\nl_dice_compat.h). Removed netlist_ttl_input_t and netlist_ttl_output_t. The logic family is governed by the chip and defaults to TTL. However individual devices may change the logic family of their inputs and outputs as well. Implementing special output/input characteristics of "S", "LS", "HC", ... you name it, devices is now pretty easy. Theoretically e.g. a "LS_HighPrecision" proxy could be used to model the output down to the transistor level. Introduced a nl_math static class to have all math related functions in one place. This is a portability exercise, e.g. log1p is not supported on all platforms. Fixed recursive call in nl_math. Straightened some code. Fixed soft reset due to wild BJT_SW oscillations Downsized nld_signal.h to one template. Some minor changes improving performance by some notches. Always compile nl_asserts to avoid bit rot. Adjusted monitor gain for Breakout. Fixed SOR criteria. Finally got USE_DEACTIVE_DEVICE to work with Breakout as well. This adds about 10% to 20% performance. In addition, increased timing accuracy for deactivated devices. However still, there may be timing inaccuracies which certain circuits may not tolerate. Disabled for now. Added netlist-level parameter NETLIST.USE_DEACTIVATE. Device deactivation optimisations can now be enabled within the netlist provided the circuit can deal with them. Fixed TTL output levels. The old ones assumed maximum currents. This fixes latch operation in Breakout. Added truthtable implementations to a number of devices. The combination of device activation, usage of GCC PMF extensions and truthtables brings breakout to 95% speed up from about 75%. Fixed NE555 initial state. Avoid header file congestion and prepare for external generic truthtables. Added device deactivation for 7486 and truthtables for 7437. Truthtables in the 7448 don't work with Pong if device de/activation is enabled. Savestate works. Truthtable device deactivation fixed. Truthtable ignore mask is now determined by a better approach identifying more ignore possibilities. Removed c99-type usage of non-const arrays. Attempt to fix warning reported by Cowering (devices\nld_9316.c). Made netlist code compile with "-Wextra -Wdouble-promotion -Wno-unused-parameter". Rewroted nl_dice_compat.h so that it can be used to support DICE to netlist syntax conversions. Example script included in the header. Started working on SPICE to netlist conversion. nltool can now convert simple SPICE netlists e.g. from LTSpice to netlist format. Added a parameter to various calls to indicate we are doing a newton-raphson. Added parray_t. Added stop virtual method to devices to be able to log statistics outside of destructors. In addition replaced printf by netlist().log(...). Removed netlist_input_t and net_output_t. Instead introduced netlist_logic_t and netlist_analog_t. Afterwards refactored proxies. This enabled more flexible connection parsing. In addition, connections between two inputs are now parked and retried after all connections were made. The netlist code now correctly parses. Fixed netlist crash on i386 32bit platforms (netlist\nl_config.h). Cleanup includes in header files, reworked memory allocation and header optimisation. Fixed a number of -Wpedantic messages in netlist. The netlist code and nltool can now be again compiled without MAME. Added a simple options class for this purpose. Only use _mm_malloc when compiling netlist standalone. Added a simple preprocessor to the netlist parsing pipeline. This prepropcessor understands defines and nested if/else/endif without removing preprocessor elements first. This does not work with netlist originating from DICE currently. These have to be converted first. In addition, cleaned up __attribute__ madness in the code. Specifically removed ATTR_COLD from virtual definitions to avoid the vtable being declared as. Fixed some netlist issues the valgrind tool pointed me too. In addition, added a strinb buffer class. Changed plist_t to be closer to vector. Commented out tons of inlines without any impact on performance. Added #ifndef, #ifdef to netlist preprocessor and implemented == operator. Fixed more -Wextra warnings, mostly int==>std::size_t and signed comparisons [Couriersud]. Fixed compile on MSVC2012 (analog\nld_twoterm.h and nl_util.h) [Peter Ferrie].
- 0.161              : Added nl_examples\9602_mstable.c, netlist\devices\nld_74175.c/h, nld_74192.c/h, nld_74193.c/h, nld_74193.h, nld_74279.c/h, nld_82S16.c/h, nld_9310.c/h and nld_9312.c/h. Added rtrim, ltrim and trim to pstring. Improved truthtable handling in netlist. Prepare per-game setting of USE_DEACTIVE_DEVICE. Added 9602 one-shot and 9312/DM9312. Document more work on breakout. Further additions to nl_dice_compat.h. Added 74192, 9316, 9310 and 74193 devices to netlist. Added 74175 and 82S16 devices to netlist. nl_breakout now compiles. Fixed 7432 and 74279 devices. Make logic signal outputs default to low at startup (devices\nld_signal.h). Always connect to the first element in NET_C (netlist\nl_setup.c). NE555 now supports reset. Various bugfixes for netlist code and improvements for breakout [Couriersud].
- 0.158              : Added netlist\nl_factory.c/h. Netlist update: Most prominent one is a "frontier" element which on a low to high impedance node will, no other connections provided. Let the system create two matrices. Fixed Visual Studio source analysis warnings (devices\nld_9316.c). Fixed bug highlighted by Visual Studio Code Analysis (netlist\nl_setup.c). Removed dependencies on MAME headers in netlist code. Fixed memory allocation in netlist code. This caused a number of memory leaks to disappear. Introduced an nl_double type. This will be followed by an nl_float type for certain components (mostly matrix and vector). Fixed crash caused by 4066 DIP device. Fixed nltool "-ld" listdevices. More netlist code reschuffle to separate setup from run. Fixed Clang (most likely > 3.4) compile (tools\nltool.c) [Couriersud].
- 0.155              : Unreachable code warning fixes for tools (tools\nltool.c) [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.154              : Added nl_examples\74123_mstable.c, breakout.c, cdelay.c, netlist\plists.h, analog\nld_ms_direct.h, nld_ms_direct1, nld_ms_direct2.h, nld_ms_gauss_seidel.h, nld_opamps.c/h, devices\nld_4020.c/h, nld_7408.c/h, nld_7411.c/h, nld_7432.c/h, nld_7437.c/h, nld_74123.c/h, nld_cmos.h, nld_r2r_dac.c/h and nld_truthtable.h. All analysis is now based on an immutable list of terminals. The dynamic list now is only used in the "hot" core. This is the base for possible further optimizations using multiple lists; e.g. a high-low transition list and a low-high transition list. Simplified netlist code. It now always provides a stable solution instead of rescheduling the solver. - fixed a bug in which the fallback solver was called instead of gauss - seidel. Matrix solvers are now subdevices of the solver devices. Matrix solvers can now be scheduled independently. Renamed RESCHED_LOOPS to GS_LOOPS (Gauss Seidel). Added paragmenter NR_LOOPS (Newton Raphson). Changed gauss seidel solver to be a subclass of direct solver and got rid of ugly fallback solution. As a result, popeye is now 45% faster in comparison to 0.153. Removed dead code in analog\nld_solver.c. Fixed a timing bug in netlist 7474. Pong Doubles now working. Thanks a lot to Adam Bousley for dual licensing DICE netlists. Hooked up player inputs. Minor performance tweaks. Separated game netlists from driver. DICE is making extensive use of macros which may conflict if these are in one source file. Added some rescap.h macros to netlist. Allow connecting a net to itself, fixed typo and be more explicit on error. Added first draft of 74123 to netlist code. Fixed gate timing (devices\nld_signal.h). Added 7408, 7411, 7432 and 7437 to netlist. Changes core_device constructor (netlist\nl_base.c). Fixed assert in netlist (netlist\nl_base.c). Analog output is always immediate. Minor changes to proxy (devices\nld_system.c). Analog input updates now send to queue. Reduces risk of stack overflows. Fixed a bug which caused NAND astable multivibrator to oscillate. 74123 improvements. Preliminary support for LTE dynamic time-stepping based on Local truncation error. This enables the possibility to connect a capacitor between ground and a TTL output and get a e.g. 100 ns delay with a 1nF capacitor. Added an example circuit (cdelay.c). Changed the log device to support nano-second granularity. LTE is not yet enabled due to it's ugly test-state. Introduced netlist_analog_net_t and netlist_logic_net_t to untangle code a bit. Fixed a bug with saving state. In addition, some minor code changes. Make recent additions (timing, local truncation error based timestep) the default. As a consequence, the solver frequency is just an indication, the timestep used can be anything between 2ns and 100 * 1/Frequency depending on the second derivative. A fixed timestep can be forced by setting DYNAMICTS to 0. For an example how this works on delaying signals using capacitors see nl_examples/cdelay.c. Straightened the timing code. With solver parameter DYNAMIC_TS=1 the system now steps each analog subnet individually by using a LTE approach. With DYNAMIC_TS=0 pure fixed timestepping is used. Reworked some code (mostly in nl_base.h) to shift variables into the private space. Netlist codebase now also compiles outside the MAME environment. Replaced tagmap with a very simple class to make it happen. Linear searches, slow, but only used during analysis. Various minor changes and some more logging. Some improvements to analog\nld_solver.c code. Renamed auxiliary types to move them into the "p" namespace (plinearlist_t, pstack_t, ...). Performance related changes. Mostly from analyzing auto-vectorization. Further simplification and clean up around the linear system solvers. Netlist updates and bugfixes: Improved convergence code (max(epsilon) instead of sum(epsilon)). Identified needless updates. Changed NE555 discharge current to a value in the order of the datasheet and improved dynamic time-stepping. Dynamic time-stepping is not used by any current implementation right now since any fast discharge will be resolved to mV levels imposing nano-second timesteps. Great and exact but deadly for performance. Resize should never have been public in netlist\plists.h. Further work on vectorization. Netlist changes: * Reworked the analog storage model to better support the compiler. This will most likely only pay off on larger matrices than currently used. Investment for future platforms with larger vectors. * Added parameter "GS_THRESHOLD" to select the minimum matrix size for Gauss-Seidel solver. * pstate: Pointer will be resolved late, i.e. after all initialization is finished. State is registered during start, but some pointers are only set during post_load in the solver. Document & save work. Pretty convoluted code now. I'd really miss the good old Cray C90. Clean Fortran code, seamless vectorization and parallelization. That's now 20 years ago and I am fighting with cryptic vectorization compiler messages today. Quite a number of changes: * Templates to provide operations for fixed matrix sizes. * Sorting of nets to increase convergence. * Successive over relaxation - for popeye a parameter of 1.05 works best. * The code commented out may provide benefits on different architectures like true vector architectures. Popeye run peaks at 1800% (up 20%) and pong has a slight performance increase as well. Disabled printf logging of stats (nld_solver.c). Removed m_new_Analog. Did some tests using linear prediction. This is not used since the savings are about the same size as the effort. Optimized netlist proxies. Small but measurable performance increase for pongf and Pong Doubles. In addition, moved some code between classes and sorted code in nl_base.c. Removed m_last_analog. Moved solver templates into separate header files. Removed a number of "uninitialized member" warnings by using a template wrapper around those members. More cleanup and some development: Removed dead code from nld_signal.h. Removed m_last_Q and all callers; if a device depends on state let it maintain it. Added development on a generic device based on truthtables. Align naming convention to be the same for nld_signal and nld_truthtable. Added CD4020 device. Device definitions now can specify the logic family (i.e. TTL, CD4000). Fixed timing on 4020. Added more device to netlist: R2R resistor network DAC. Dummy input device. This is used so that devices can exhibit terminals not yet used such as V+ for opamps. Added a very basic macro model for norton opamps (LM3900). Added a current controlled current source (CCCS) [Couriersud]. Correct some device shortname/longname conflicts that had surfaced [Tafoid]. Experimental fix for building with MSVC 2012 (it might fix ICC too); Either works for MSVC 2012 & MinGW, someone needs to test with ICC (netlist\nl_dice_compat.h) [smf].
- 0.153              : Added netlist\nl_dice_compat.h, netlist\analog\nld_bjt.c/h, nld_fourterm.c/h, nld_switches.c/h, netlist\devices\nld_4066.c/h, nld_7400.c, nld_7402.c, nld_7410.c, nld_7420.c, nld_7425.c, nld_7427.c, nld_7430.c, nld_7448.c/h, nld_7450.c/h, nld_74107.c/h, nld_74153.c/h, nld_74ls629.c/h, nl_examples\7400_astable.c, bjt.c, bjt_eb.c, bjt_eb_pnp.c, cd4066.c, msx_mixer_stage.c, ne555_astable.c, opamp.c, sn74ls629_osc.c, tdice.c, test.c, todo.c, vccs.c and vccs1.c. Moved analog stuff netlist\devices\nld_solver.c/h, nld_switches.c/h and nld_twoterm.c/h to netlist\analog. Added missing interfaces to netlist. MAME -debug pongf now does not crash any longer and displays some state. Still more work needed. Further improved the netlist state saving. Fixed Clang compile (netlist\nl_base.h and pstate.h), hopefully this works on OSX as well. Removed legacy code in netlist and separated out 74153 and 74107(A). Alignment of netlist with MAME standards. Inputs to netlist are now registered using by MCFG_* as MAME subdevices and exhibit the usual writeXX/readXX methods including a PORT_CHANGED method. This allows direct linking to inputs. Make some class variables protected. Split netlist_mame_device_t into a core device and a "cpu" device. Further untangled nl_base.c/h and mame-specific netlist.c. Enhanced the netlist parser and cleaned pong.c. Also added a folder nl_examples which contains standalone netlist examples. The examples have a ".c" suffix. In eclipse, I get automatic syntax parsing and error notifications. The parser treats "#" preprocessor defines/includes just as comments. All of these examples can be run through nltool: ./nltool -f nl_examples/opamp.c -t 1 -l OUT. Runs the opamp example for 1 second of emulation time and logs the terminal named "OUT" to "netlist_log_OUT.log". I'll post a simple script to the list to visualize those logs using gnuplot. Fixed PNP model and added test netlist (bjt.c). Pong now has complete emulation of discrete logic for runQ and SRST signals. Rewrote switch2 device to be based on resistances as well. Netlist: Fixed 7474 save state. Removed a printf. Simplified netlist_list_t. Increased reschedule count to 15 - diodes are dog-slow. Made reschedule count a solver parameter. Simplified solver code. Solver time now also resets. Netlist: Added missing parameter to analog input device. Parser now parses NET_MODEL (netlist\nl_parser.c). Fixed a bug in switching bjt implementation. Added Ebers-Moll BJT model. Currently only for NPN. Fixed convergence issue in the solver. Accuracy for Ebers-Moll must be better than 1e-5 to not generate nano-second spikes. Typical sound applications should be able to run with less since the spikes are not audible. Added a "-listdevices" option to nltool to list all available devices. Simplified code. Quite a number of simplifications for netlist. Also tested some parallel processing using OpenMP (disabled). Removed pointless "...->object()->" usage and fixed some issues in debug build. Implemented an improved solving scheme into netlist. This improves performance for Pong. Also set Pong frequency to NETLIST_CLOCK. This is necessary to avoid issues with time conversion into attotime and consequently rounding issues in fixfreq. Implemented near-to-proper reset for all netlist devices. Reset now works for improved matrix solving. Removed two duplicate devices in netlist. Removed some dead code and ambiguous functions in the netlist code. An output should have at most one d-to-a proxy connected to it. Made GND a device of it's own (actually a terminal container). Introduced the concept of "logic families". Currently, standard devices default to TTL. Going forward, this enables the family type (e.g. LS, S, HCT, ...) to be a device parameter. Created a MAME sound device for netlist. Fixed an issue causing wild oscillations. Currently, pong has sample code for using the sound device. Uncomment "test_sound" in pong.c to hear a constant sound from a 7400 multivibrator. Sound is still WIP, but the proof of concept has been done. Working Ebers Moll model. That's a significant step ahead. Simple 2x2|RHS SPICE stamps now supported by two terminal devices. This was implicitly contained in the design, but set_mat now shows how a two-terminal device fits into a SPICE approach. Introduced direct solvers for net groups with 1 or 2 nets. Introduced specialized solvers for N=1,2,3,4,5 by using templates. Nice performance increase for BJTs. Removed dead code and simplified matrix solvers. Fixed direct solver bug. Using direct solver up to matrices of 4x4 now. for bigger matrices gauss-seidel is used. Major renaming of netlist device macros, like NETDEV_ALIAS ==> ALIAS, NETDEV_R ==> RES and NETDEV_C ==> CAP. Added some pin assignment devices (*_dip). DICE connects package pins, not logical entities. Added DIP package pinouts to 7474 and 9316. Fixed reported memory leak in debug build (netlist\pstring.c/h). Minor bugfixes + parser is now based on tokens. Should ease reading other netlist formats significantly. Removed dead code in nL_parser.c. Added pin-outs to a number of devices. Fixed minor bugs and removed a hack in 7490 code. Documented two more devices (7448 and 7450), more pin-outs. Corrected some pin names so they match datasheets better. Bugfixes and more pin-outs for netlist devices. Also contains preparation for inclusion of "pong doubles". Fix a bug in connecting nets. This bug surfaced during introduction of a "closer to reality" TTL output proxy. Created a better logic-to-analog proxy approximating output impedance. This revealed some bugs in the code which have been fixed. Basically, borderline schematics like TTL_7404_INVERT(c9f, c9c.Q), TTL_7404_INVERT(c9c, c9f.Q), SWITCH2(coinsw), NET_C(c9c.Q, coinsw.1) and NET_C(c9f.Q, coinsw.2) in which the switch connects TTL-Outputs to ground now work. In this case, the addition of an analog device (switch) cause the netlist code to treat the TTL outputs as "analog" and (re)connect all existing and future connected terminals to the analog output. The downside is a slight performance penalty. This penalty may be mitigated going forward by introducing "proxy-hints" for selected outputs. Fixed a nasty issue around convergence by defaulting to Gaussian elemination for 5x5 and 6x6 matrices. This prevented pong from starting. In addition, removed a number of hacks around start-up conditions. All nets are now defaulted to "0" at startup. Much cleaner. Added a 74LS629 device which yet needs to be enabled. Implemented a fallback to Gaussian elimination if Gauss-Seidel exceeds a certain number of iterations. Netlist bugfixes: Fixed completely broken parser. Fixed reset (consistent again). Added "warning" and "log" to "error". "-oslog" now displays some information. Fixed an issue causing prolonged instability in 7400 oscillators. Added route-inputs to netlist sound device. Currently this is WIP and needs some polishing, however proof-of-concept exists now. Example usage can be enabled in pong by uncommenting test_sound. Some bug fixes for sound device routing. Pong Doubles (yet to be committed) starts up again. Added a parameter "MULT" for output multiplication to NETDEV_Sound_OUT. Added a safety check to resistor device to avoid divide by zeros. Only update parameters if they have changed. All MAME <-> Netlist interfacing is now done in the machine device driver. This a) ensures, that the interface logic is in one place and easy to understand b) ensures, that netlists represent the hardware and not what has to be done to hook the hardware up in MAME. The interface part is considered to be relatively stable. Netlist code maintenance work. Made device startup cleaner. Netlist maintenance: Made frequency a obligatory parameter for CLOCK, MAINCLOCK and SOLVER. Fixed a bad memory corruption. Added "owner" to save states. This allows to remove objects after they registered state. Fixed VCCS and VCVS. Commit current state of netlist examples. Later, these are intended as a basis for regression tests. Netlist maintenance: Netlist construction now is relying on fully qualified names, i.e. the name of a netlist object now starts with the netlist name. This is a first step towards supporting netlist models, i.e. netlists which can be used as a macro model. Very handy for opamps. Changed log file filename format. Support analog net groups of up to 256 nets (i.e. Voltages). Call netlist().error if more than 64 nets are found (analog\nld_solver.c). Preparation to cope with multiple netlists from single source. Netlist can now be included as sub-circuits. That's the same approach SPICE uses. The implementation also supports nesting. Opamp emulation now is as easy as. The missing bit now is a central submodel repository. nl_examples/opamp.c is an example of a impedance changer stage followed by a 1:2 amplifier stage. System size (= number of voltage levels to be calculated) is between 20 - 30. Using a simple, yet better opamp model than usually implemented in the old discrete core, I get ./nltool -f nl_examples/opamp.c -t 30 startup time ==> 0.002 runnning. 30.000000 seconds emulation took 0.438599 real time ==> 6839.96%. Which leaves quite some buffer to emulate even complex mixing and filtering stages in real-time. Abstracted netlist sources. This is a first step to support libraries (e.g. for opamps). Fixed nltool -listdevices. Thanks Oliver. Minor netlist updates with focus on performance. Also added 16bit int to pstate. Fixed fatalerror if we are trying to connect two railnets (nl_setup.c). Fixed netlist examples. Fixed a netlist crash on Clang due to ATTR_NORETURN. Also fixed some debug statements. Fixed Visual-C build (nld_system.h). NPN BJT now working. NET_C now accepts more than two terminals. Fixed handling of input/output offsets. Moved device models for diodes and bjts into net_lib.c. Implemented CD4066 device (Quad Bilateral Switch). Use C99 variadic syntax (..., __VA_ARGS). Renamed a member in nld_4066 as well. Removed hybrid_t usage in netlist. Made GMIN a solver parameter. All users now use this value. Nice performance increase by removing logic terminals from net if they are inactive. Introduced a linked-list class to abstract linked-lists. Fixed deactivating devices. You have to enable this because it is not guaranteed to be timing-exact. Fixed issues introduced lately around DICE compatibility [Couriersud]. Fixed building with standard development tools (netlist\nl_config.h). Visual studio 2012 compilation fix (netlist\nl_parser.h) [smf].
- 0.152              : Removed netlist\devices\nld_7400.c. Added netlist\nl_util.h, pstring.c/h. devices\nld_7402.h, nld_7404.c/h, nld_7410.h, nld_7420.h, nld_7425.h, nld_7427.h, nld_7430.h, nld_7474.c/h, nld_7483.c/h, nld_7486.c/h, nld_7490.c/h, nld_7493.c/h, nld_9316.c/h, nld_legacy.c/h, nld_log.c/h, nld_NE555.c/h, nld_solver.c/h, nld_system.c/h, nld_twoterm.c/h, pstate.c/h and tools\nltool.c. Moved 7402 and 7410 into separate files. Moved 7420 into its own header file, optimzed some memory ops. Removed hardcoded maximum net size. Separated and documented a couple more devices out of net_lib.c. Outputs now drive nets and inputs access nets. Moved more stuff to net_terminal. Added some documentation to nl_base.h. Cleared namespace - all classes now have prefix netlist_. Working voltage divider. Added capacitor. At 50kHz, calculating a resistor net and a cap doesn't hit performance. Added large signal diode model (things like astable NAND Multivibrator) and fixed a number of bugs. Every object has a name. Reworked object model a bit. There is a slight performance drop (7%). Memory allocation order seems to be an issue here. Added pascal like strings (pstring) class. These use only size(void *) in objects. Uses reference counter to share identical string between various pstrings. In addition, fixed some bugs and added auto-sizing to netlist_list_t. There shouldn't be memory holes left now, apart from memory allocated in a static class factory. Documented 7430 & 7486. Fixed crash when using analog chips. Did some preparation work to generalize internal links. Singled out and documented 7404 and 7474. Introducing type safe parameters. Pretend accuracy by specifying tons of parameters for diode model of which only two are used. Speed comes at a price. Now, even a CVD (Constant voltage drop) diode model with series resistor can benefit from these parameters by using them to estimate a typical operating point and thus dynamic resistance when the model is setup. Fixed design weakness. Subdevices now register their terminals. Devices can alias those terminals. Now, e.g. a 7400 gate many be grouped into a Quad NAND package. This also enables using internal resistors and capacitors. Pong: Pure analog video mixing. Only in pongf currently. Once code stabilizes, the netlist parser will be updated as well. Code clean-up. Implemented a generic NE555 model. Period accuracy for astable operation is within 2% of the TI datasheet for astable operation. Fixed an issue in the object model as well and made the code distinguish between a core terminal and analog terminals. Logs now write to individual log files. Fixed Windows build (netlist\pstring.c)(Windows std dev tools use GCC 4.6.3. This version seems to be to broken to deal with "new" in static initialization. GCC 4.6.4 compiles this on Linux without causing any issues). Class factory is now initialized dynamically. Fixed a memory leak. Documented 7493. Added a simplified BJT Switch Model. This should be sufficient for audio purposes in >> 90% of all cases I have seen so far. The performance of the analog subsystem has quite some room for improvement. Boils analog subsystem down to (G - D) * V = I with G being the conductance matrix, D a diagonal matrix with total conductance on the diagonal elements, V the net voltage vector and I the current vector. By using solely two terminal devices, we can simplify the whole calculation significantly. A BJT now is a four terminal device with two terminals being connected internally. The system is solved using an iterative approach: G * V - D * V = I, assuming V=Vn=Vo and Vn = D-1 * (I - G * Vo). The above was already used in the code. However, with a pure two terminal device approach going forward we can e.g. further optimize. G typically is a sparse matrix. First steps at taking advantage of sparse matrix properties. The code now identifies net groups. A net group contains nets which depend on each other. Purely conductive nets can going forward be updated solely if one of the rail nets they are connected to changes. Changed netlist_matrix_solver to be a class. Rewrote the "switch" BJT implementation. Minor bugfixes. Added VCCS and VCVS components. Added over-relaxation on demand to the iterative solver. Added a slightly more complex opamp model example to Pong (commented out). Logs on demand (NL_LOGS=EBUF.OP:4V; mame64 -np 4 pongf). pongf now runs 4 analog NE555s and video mixing (performance down by 20% abs on my machine - 155% to 135%). Minor bugfixes. Pong still running, pongf still (though analog) still faster. Separated MAME specific code into netlist.h. Diode model now uses a fast exp function which is approx. 3x faster than build-in at the expense of reduced accuracy. We are emulating real device with tolerances, so this is not an issue. Update the parser code. The "rom" netlist and preprocessor netlist are now aligned again. Got rid of fatalerror in netlist\* code. Implementing applications have to implement fatalerror in a derived class from netlist_base_t now. Hopefully fixed "red lines". Improved 9316 code. General code maintenance. Started work on netlist audio device support. Improved netlist parser. Pong update: Based on feedback from IRC hopefully fixed issues like "jumping". Adjusted VR1 and VR2 to 50%. Disabled all printf output. Introduced more consistent and general state saving. Useful for regression tests going forward [Couriersud]. Fixed debug build; someone please review these changes (netlist\nl_base.h) [Wilbert Pol]. Fixed linking with visual studio (netlist\nl_base.c) and compiling (netlist\pstring.c). Fix for MSVC, I provided the wrong version number to couriers (Visual Studio 2013 is 1800 & I believe that supports log1p but I haven't tested it yet) (netlist\devices\nld_twoterm.h) [smf]. Reinstated functionality in pstring. This should now be compatible with MSVC [Couriersud].
- 0.151              : Added netlist\devices\nld_7400.c/h, devices\nld_signal.h, devices\nld_system.h, netlist\netlist.mak, nl_base.c/h, nl_config.h, nl_lists.h, nl_parser.c/h, nl_setup.c/h and nl_time.h. Moved machine\net_lib.c/h to netlist\devices. Fixed a bug in netlib's NE555 emulation. Optimized some netlist code by inlining clock device. This improves pongf performance by approx. 10%. Fixed a small but important bug in netlist code. In addition, some more performance improvements. More netlist cleanups. All netlist device setup now takes place in constructors. Slightly improved performance on netlist components. Minor code clean-up in netlist devices. Fixed to work with MSVC 2012, the second NETLIB_DEVICE parameter is a list of the protected variables and MSVC doesn't like #if within the parameters to a macro. Fixed an Netlist issue with 7493 and other minor fixes. Netlist cleanup: Simplified classes and separated logic and analog inputs/outputs. Moved device setup out of constructor (again). This wasn't a good idea because some more advanced stuff like virtual function address caching doesn't work in constructors. Some hand-crafted optimizations. GCC seems to like ugly pointer C more than using readable arrays. Netlist now uses astring instead of char *. Makes memory management a lot easier. Fixed a number of memory leaks as well. Driver reset now works. Created folder emu\netlist and moved net_lib.* over. Updated makefiles (netlist\netlist.mak). Split the netlist code up into functional pieces like parser, setup and execution. This looks a lot more structured now and highlighted some issue already [Couriersud]. Fixed for empty controlled statement with MSVC 2012. Fixed linking with MSVC 2012. Moved netdev_mainclock update & update_param from netlist.c to net_lib.c to fix linking error in MSVC and still have it link with MSVC [smf].
- 0.148u4            : Fix for GCC prior to 4.3 (machine\netlist.h) [Federico Schwindt].
- 0.147u3            : Symbols starting with _ are reserved in many BSD-derived environments (machine\netlist.h) [Robert Muth].
- 0.147              : Updated netlist implementation: Now supports any resolution fitting reasonably into a UINT64. Execution now uses a list sorted by execution time. Implementation now supports analog and digital inputs / outputs. First step in a move to "terminals" being both input / output. Improved object model. Pong: Rewrote video code, now emulates a monitor by analyzing the analog video signal and identifying vsync and hysnc pulses. Removed all hacks. Overall performance increase of about 10% over the previous "pongf" implementation [Couriersud]. Pass some parameters in netlist.h by reference for consistency [Oliver Stöneberg]. Netlist memory leak fix [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.146u4            : Added emu\machine\netlist.c/h and net_lib.c/h. Implemented a generic implementation to model discrete net lists [Couriersud]: Based on timeslot modelling, the implementation models gate delays in logic chips. Design ready to be split into a generic and a MAME implementation part. Design prepared to merge in discrete components from discrete. Supports code based as well as external net list parsing. Ultimately, net lists and discrete emulation should share one code base. The class design was set up to accomplish this. There is no point in having multiple 555, 7474 implementations around. Most of the code will be moved to lib\netlist going forward to allow usage in other projects. Pong now uses netlist.h. This implementation reproduces all gate timing and 555 related effects as described by Dr. H. Holden in his 2012 publication "ATARI PONG E CIRCUIT ANALYSIS & LAWN TENNIS". There are now two game entries: a) pongf: This illustrates how a workaround has to be used in the absence of gate timing. The game uses a code based netlist. b) pong: This uses gate timing at a resolution of approx. 140 MHz. The netlist itself is read from the rom region. Phill W. fixed constant overflow, 64 bit constants require U64() macro (machine\netlist.c).
- 20th July      2012: AdamB - After more than 4 years since the last release of DICE, a new version emerges (v0.3 with Pong, Rebound, Gotcha and Spacerace).
- 0.146u1            : Couriersud re-added Pong (Rev E) (Atari 1972). Work in progress. The games is playable and has sound, however I suspect some minor bugs due to the order of expression evaluation. I commit this mainly for documentation purposes. The modelling of the TTL circuits will change to a device/connection class infrastructure updating inputs immediately if they changed going forward.
- 10th February  2008: AdamB - Dice 0.2 has been released. Now supports 3 games, sound and more. What's New: 2 new games are supported: Atari Rebound and Atari Gotcha (driver written by Dan Boris). Preliminary Sound support. Optimization: Pong runs about 30% faster than previous versions. Fullscreen Mode: Add the command line option -fullscreen to run in full screen mode. Mouse Support: Add the command line option -mouse to use the mouse for Player 1.
-  6th January   2008: AdamB - Finally got around to releasing the first version of my Discrete Integrated Circuit Emulator, DICE. This is a very early release and hasn't been tested fully, so there may be some bugs still. So far only Pong is supported, hopefully more games will be added in the future.
- 25th February  2007: Mr. Do - You can grab Pong artwork, vectored by Jcroach, on loan from Vintage Arcade Superstore.
- 0.36RC1            : This game was removed from MAME. Nicola wrote: Pong was too much of a simulation and too little of an emulation. It didn't really fit into MAME's architecture which is CPU-based and targeted at accurately reproducing the gameplay of the original.
- 0.36b10            : Juergen Buchmueller added Pong! (Atari 1972). This game has no roms.
- GAMES: Pong (Atari 1972)

S1.    MAME Sound Interface

- 0.189              : Synchronize machine\gen_latch.cpp at start to ensure broadcast of initial "not written" state. This fixes sound in Onna Sanshirou and makes the N.Y. Captor hack unnecessary. Fixed CPU communication issue in flstory.cpp that sometimes caused sound to disappear entirely [AJR].
- 0.188              : Make a few more methods const (emu\disound.cpp) [AJR]. Added machine().side_effect_disabled to machine\gen_latch.cpp [Vas Crabb].
- 0.187              : Allow device to be configured for acknowledgement to occur separately from data reads (machine\gen_latch.cpp); use this for Armed Police Batrider [AJR].
- 0.186              : Updated mame\audio and devices\sound devices to use device_add_mconfig insted of device_mconfig_additions [Osso].
- 0.182              : New callback for generic_latch_8/16_device: Added MCFG_GENERIC_LATCH_DATA_PENDING_CB to raise and lower a line automatically as the latch is written and read. This should make sound IRQs easier to deliver and reduce the incidence of HOLD_LINE in drivers. Updated a few drivers to use this new callback (dec0.cpp and discoboy.cpp). Invert logic (latch_read -> latch_written). Also fixes initial callback after start [AJR].
- 0.177              : Fixed audio distortion with -refreshspeed and -sound xaudio2. Try to fix audio delay regression caused when fixing -refreshspeed for -sound xaudio2 [Antonio Giner]. Minor XAudio2 tweak to not always submit buffers if not needed [Brad Hughes].
- 0.175              : Second-to-last gen_latch.cpp update. Removed the old soundlatch methods (emu\driver.cpp). Sound trampolines removal from various drivers [Osso]. Ensure XAudio2 doesn't crash when no sound card present (sound\xaudio2_sound.cpp). Added XAudio2 init time logging [Brad Hughes].
- 0.174              : Updated drivers to use the new gen_latch.cpp, which should substitute the soundlatch_* methods in driver_device [Osso]. Fixed init of XAudio2 when there is no window active [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.173              : Added machine\gen_latch.cpp/h. Added generic latch to replace soundlatch in driver_device and additional members for compatibility [Miodrag Milanovic]. Use XAudio2 by default if available (lib\osdobj_common.cpp) [Brad Hughes].
- 0.172              : Changed 3rdparty\win81sdk\Include\um\xaudio2.h to 3rdparty\compat\mingw\xaudio2.h. Added missing XAudio2 header from WINE that is free to use. Make XAudio2 available in all Windows OSD builds, plus use 2.9 if available and code cleanup [Brad Hughes].
- 0.171              : Don't crash on state load when the mixer is disabled by lack of inputs (misconfiguration or missing samples) (emu\disound.cpp) [O. Galibert].
- 0.170              : Added 3rdparty\win81sdk\Include\um\xaudio2.h and sound\xaudio2_sound.cpp. Have sound_stream::input_name return the std::string it constructs (emu\sound.cpp) [AJR]. XAudio2 support. Update XAudio2 support to handle overflow, underflow and audio_latency properly [Brad Hughes].
- 0.161              : Proper C++ for DirectSound module, get rid of all static variables, some encapsulation (modules\sound\direct_sound.c) [Vas Crabb]. Preventing asserting on vector item access (emu\sound.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.159              : Removed lots of useless sound IRQ trampolines leftover from the pre-devcb era (drivers\backfire.c, bfm_sc4h.c, bfm_sc5.c, bfm_swp.c, bishi.c, cabal.c, deco156.c, gunpey.c, maygayep.c, midas.c, nmk16.c, powerins.h, quizpani.h, shanghai.c, toaplan2.c and zn.c) [Alex Jackson].
- 0.158              : Removed lots of useless sound IRQ trampolines leftover from the pre-devcb era (drivers\actfancr.c, aerofgt.c, alpha68k.c, crospang.c, dec8.c, deniam.c, fuukifg2.c, fuukifg3.c, galspnbl.c, hcastle.c, itech8.c, lordgun.c, metro.c, midtunit.c, nemesis.c, nmg5.c, oneshot.c, onetwo.c, prehisle.c, psikyo.c, psikyo4.c, psikyosh.c, stadhero.c, snk68.c, snowbros.c, spbactn.c, spdodgeb.c, spy.c, suna8.c, tbowl.c, tecmo.c, toaplan1.c, toaplan2.c, twincobr.c, wardner.c and yunsun16.) [Alex Jackson].
- 0.154              : Changed remaining references to -nosound to -sound none in code and docs; moved description of -sound option to OSD-specific doc files to be orthogonal to -video [Alex Jackson]. USE 64bit intermediary results in sound_stream::generate_resampled_data (emu\sound.c). This will allow sound drivers (see AY-3-8910) to make use of the full width of stream_sample_t [Couriersud].
- 0.153              : Added savestate registration for the generic soundlatches, which seemed like a good idea. Any particular reason why these weren't being saved? [Alex Jackson].
- 0.151              : Removed SOUND_START legacy MACRO. Added SOUND_START_MEMBER and SOUND_RESET_MEMBER macros (emu\driver.h, emu\drivlgcy.h, mame\audio\cchasm.c, mame\audio\cinemat.c, mame\audio\dkong.c, mame\audio\jedi.c, mame\audio\mario.c, mame\audio\mw8080bw.c, mame\audio\n8080.c, mame\audio\redalert.c, mame\audio\scramble.c, mame\audio\segag80r.c, mame\drivers\cchasm.c, mame\drivers\dkong.c, mame\drivers\equites.c, mame\drivers\jangou.c, mame\drivers\lucky74.c, mame\drivers\mirax.c, mame\drivers\n8080.c, mame\drivers\segag80r.c and mame\includes\lucky74.h). Removed SOUND_RESET legacy MACRO (emu\driver.h, audio\cinemat.c, includes\cchasm.h) [Osso].
- 0.148u4            : Made m_audiocpu, m_subcpu and m_soundcpu optional for those drivers setting value on null, rest will need to be catch with automated tests (includes\aerofgt.h, bishi.h, btime.h, cave.h, champbas.h, cps1.h, cvs.h, dec8.h, dynax.h, f1gp.h, fromanc2.h, gaelco.h, gameplan.h, homedata.h, marineb.h, mexico86.h, moo.h, pgm.h, psikyo.h, system16.h, taito_l.h, taito_z.h, tmnt.h, tnzs.h, tumbleb.h and yunsun16.h). Changed machine().device("soundcpu") with m_soundcpu. Same for "sub" and "subcpu" [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.147u1            : Removed some expressions which are always true (emu\sound.c) [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.146u4            : hap fixed soundlatch warning (emu\driver.c).
- 0.145u8            : Fixed sound code dependency, this fixes linking of tiny build (sound\sound.mak) [Miodrag Milanovic]. Separated user gain from input gain. Added more functions to map inputs and devices to outputs in sound streams. Some general cleanups in the sound/streaming code [Aaron Giles].
- 0.145u7            : Removed audio\generic.c/h and emu\watchdog.c/h. Moved soundlatch helpers into driver.c. Normalized soundlatch helper function names. Created delegates for machine / sound / video_start / reset callbacks and added necessary infrastructure to use them going forward [Aaron Giles]. Non device audio board modernization [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.145u6            : Moved all drivers to using the audio/watchdog helpers defined in the driver_device base class [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.145u4            : Make all items connected to mixer inputs available in the UI, not just items connected to speakers [Aaron Giles].
- 0.145u2            : Create a new device_mixer_interface, derived from device_sound_interface, which mixes all its inputs to a single output stream. Redefined the SPEAKER device to use this and remove the duplicate underlying logic. The main purpose of this new interface is to allow device-ification of an entire sound board, which can itself become a mixer of all of its sound components to a single output stream. This stream can then be routed by the device's owner to the appropriate speakers. A real-life example will show up soon [Aaron Giles].
- 0.141u2            : Removed emu\streams.c/h. C++-ified the sound and streams interfaces. Combined sound.c and streams.c into one file, and separated the speaker device into its own file. Generalized the concept of dynamically assigned inputs and re-wired the speaker to work this way, so it is now treated just like any other sound device. Added methods to the device_sound_interface for controlling output gain and mapping device inputs/outputs to stream inputs/outputs. Also made the sound_stream_update() method pure virtual, so all modern sound devices must use the new mechanism for stream updates [Aaron Giles]. Curt Coder added all CPU and sound devices in emu folder to the MAME build.
- 0.141u1            : Added a virtual stream update function to the device sound interface. Added a new stream_create that takes fewer parameters and calls the device's stream update. Removed the stream update stub template. Updated BSMT2000 and OKIM6295 to use the new interface for their streams [Aaron Giles].
- 0.139u4            : Atari Ace updated driver-specific sound devices to use tokens and store their state like other devices.
- 0.139u3            : Atari Ace removed artificial SOUND_ prefix from sound device names. Aaron Giles moved sound routing for non-speaker devices over to the sound interface's post-start method. Routing from one sound device to another was broken when sound_init() was moved ahead of device startup.
- 0.138u2            : Added emu\disound.c/h.
- 0.136u1            : Removed sndintrf.h. Aaron Giles removed the various HAS_xxxx for sound cores. To select sound cores, just choose them in the make system. Further granularity is not necessary. This also means that the samples core is always required.
- 0.135u1            : Aaron Giles expanded some sound chip tags to specifically indicate they are sound chips (generally, "ay" becomes "aysnd", "fm" becomes "fmsnd", etc).
- 0.134u4            : Dirk Best changed device callback system to look up devices owned by the same parent if a child device references another device.
- 0.133u5            : Atari Ace de-globalified sound.c.
- 0.131u1            : Deprecated device_set_info. Almost all devices had a NULL or empty function here. Remaining devices have been converted to have device-specific functions to do the same thing with proper type checking. CPUs still have a set_info function but it is CPU-specific now and no longer piggybacks on the general device function [Aaron Giles].
- 0.129u4            : Removed emu\sndintrf.c. WARNING: This build has a major change in it (sound chips are now devices) that may lead to some unexpected errors or sound problems. Please report any issues you find over at http://mametesters.org/mantis. Aaron Giles converted all sound chips into proper devices. Merged the sound chip interface into the device interface, removing any differences (such as the whole ALIASing concept). Aaron Giles modified every sound chip in the following ways: Updated to match the device interface. Reduced read/write handlers down to the minimal number. Added the use of get_safe_token() for ensuring correctness. Other minor cleanup. Aaron Giles vastly simplified the sound interfaces, removing the ghastly sndti_* business and moving everyone over to using tags for sound identity. sndintrf, like cpuintrf, is now just a header file with no implementation. Modified each and every driver that references a sound chip [Aaron Giles]: All memory maps explicitly reference the targeted device via AM_DEVREAD/AM_DEVWRITE/AM_DEVREADWRITE. 16-bit and 32-bit accesses to 8-bit chips no longer use trampoline functions but instead use the 8-bit AM_DEVREAD/WRITE macros. All references to sound chips are now done via tags. Note that these changes are brute force, not optimal; in many cases drivers should grab pointers to devices in MACHINE_START and stash them away. Aaron Giles added the ability for devices to have their own custom inline config management. This was primarily added to allow for sound routes to be supported in a way that is compatible with the current driver structure. A device can now define a DEVICE_CUSTOM_CONFIG callback which is called whenever one of the MCONFIG_TOKEN_DEVICE_CONFIG_CUSTOM_* tokens is encountered. A special token MCONFIG_TOKEN_DEVICE_CONFIG_CUSTOM_FREE is defined to clean up memory allocated and/or reset the custom configuration, and is called when the device is torn down to allow for memory cleanup.
- 0.129u2            : Sound cores no longer allocate their own tokens. Instead they return a new integer value indicating the size of token they want, and the core allocates it for them. This mirrors the standard device behavior [Aaron Giles]. Aaron Giles removed redundant config parameter from SND_START.
- 0.129u1            : Atari Ace removed the sndindex parameter from SND_START, in favor of using the device pointer or tag as appropriate. Atari Ace made the treatment of SOUND_xxx the same as that of CPU_xxx. That is, they are function pointers to the SND_GET_INFO routine for the sound. Dirk Best removed several useless occurrences of "#define INLINE" in CPU and sound cores.
- 0.129              : Atari Ace updated all the sound core header files to declare their SND_GET_INFO functions, which will be needed once the sound cores become proper devices. It also makes a handful of other header declaration fixes in emu\sound, and makes one SND_RESET routine static. Note: votrax.h is a new include file altogether. Aaron Giles changed all CPU and sound cores to use memory_find_address_space() instead of cpu_get_address_space(). The former is reliable even during early initialization when the CPU cores generally need it.
- 0.128u7            : Aaron Giles cleaned up device and sound interfaces to match the CPU interfaces when handling strings. Namely, the generic get_info functions allocate a temporary string and the device in question copies its string to the target, instead of assigning a const char *. Updated all device and sound cores to operate this way.
- 0.128u6            : Atari Ace removed remaining deprecat.h references from the sound cores.
- 0.128u5            : Atari Ace furthered the process of aligning the sound cores with the recent cpu core changes. Added a fake device implementation similar to the one the cpu cores are using. Made some interface adjustments aligned to 128u4 (i.e. adding snd_class_header, adding get_ to various getter functions). The primary benefit of this change is the removal of "deprecat.h" from 23 sound cores. Also adjusted ui.c to stop calling sndnum_clock and access the clock data similarly to how it does the cpu clock data. Note from Aaron: Further changes to the sound interfaces will be kept to a minimum until the CPUs are sorted out. Aaron Giles extended the fake sound devices to have more populated fields. Modified sound cores to use tags from the devices and simplified the start function. Aaron Giles renumbered CPU and sound get/set info constants to align with the device constants, and shared values where they were perfectly aligned. Aaron Giles set the type field in the fake device_configs for CPU and sound chips to a get_info stub which calls through to the CPU and sound specific get_info functions. This means the device_get_info() functions work for CPU and sound cores, even in their fake state. Aaron Giles changed device information getters from device_info() to device_get_info() to match the CPU and sound macros.
- 0.128u4            : Defined macros for standard sound core functions and updated all sound cores to use them [Atari Ace].
- 0.127u3            : CPUs, sound chips, devices and ROM-regions which are specified by devices now have their tags auto-prefixed with the device's tag. This allows for multiple instances to be present. For example, the PR-8210 laserdisc player has a CPU with a tag of "pr8210". When it is included as a device by a driver, the driver may tag the device "laserdisc". The resulting final CPU tag name will be "laserdisc:pr8210". Also updated the debugger expression engine to support names with embedded colons [Aaron Giles]. Aaron Giles added checks to ensure that tags used for CPUs, sound chips, regions and devices follow some basic rules: they should be less than 15 characters long, be all lower-case, and only contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dots (no spaces). This is to ensure that they can be used properly in debugger expressions and don't get too long or unwieldy to type (even 15 chars is rather long). Fixed up all tags in the system that failed these checks.
- 0.127u2            : Aaron Giles changed refreshspeed target to 0.25Hz below rate provided, in order to guarantee that inexact timings do not lead to sound stuttering.
- 0.127              : Oliver Stoenberg removed duplicated TMS5110 entry in sound.mak.
- 0.126u5            : Oliver Stoeneberg cleaned up and grouped the sound chip entries based on sound.mak. Derrick Renaud updated structure and naming conventions of sound and CPU cores to match core conventions.
- 0.126u3            : Aaron Giles introduced a new auto-binding mechanism for sound cores. This works similarly to the CPU binding. Each sound core that requires a memory region now auto-binds to the region with the same tag as the sound core. In almost all cases, this allowed for the removal of the explicit region item in the sound configuration, which in turn allowed for many sound configurations to removed altogether.
- 0.126u2            : Aaron Giles removed MDRV_SOUND_ADD. Renamed MDRV_SOUND_ADD_TAG to MDRV_SOUND_ADD. All sound chips must now include a tag. Changed all existing drivers to define a unique tag for each sound chip.
- 0.124a             : Aaron Giles fixed major regression in 0.124 which caused many sound routes to be applied incorrectly (emu\mconfig.c).
- 0.123u2            : Atari Ace added some missing cores to sndintrf.c.
- 0.122u7            : Couriersud added MDRV_SOUND_ROUTE_EX to specify target input channel. Added input ID to route struct (emu\driver.h).
- 0.121u3            : Aaron Giles added an assert to ensure that the sound clear latch value is only set at init time, since its value is not saved.
- 0.120u3            : Some build-related improvements to the sound cores [Atari Ace]: The WAVE dependency on MESS code was made explicit, so it can be built independentally of MESS.
- 0.120u1            : Atari Ace defined strict types for CPU and sound chips.
- 0.118u5            : Atari Ace changed all comparison for CPU and sound chip types to compare against CPU_DUMMY or SOUND_DUMMY instead of 0. Also updated usages of sndti_to_sndnum() so that they use sndti_exists() where appropriate.
- 0.116u3            : Zsolt Vasvari updated all sound cores to use mame_time instead of double.
- 0.116              : Atari Ace improved independence of CPU and sound core variants in order to make them more properly separated by the existing compile-time flags.
- 0.114u3            : Added support for aliasing sound types. This allows minor variants in sound cores to share the same fundamental "type" so that the same sndti_* functions can be used regardless of the subtype [Aaron Giles].
- 0.114              : Aaron Giles fixed DirectSound error if soundcard is disabled or not installed.
- 0.112u4            : Aaron Giles changed most sound cores to generate audio at their internal clock rates (or some multiple/divisor of them) rather than at the user specified output rate. This completes the second step of decoupling audio emulation from the user's sample rate choice.
- 0.112u1            : Aaron Giles added new function sound_find_sndnum_by_tag() to look up a sound index by its tag.
- 0.111u1            : Nathan Woods adding remaining MESS sound cores (sound\sid.c, sid6581.c, sidenvel.c, sp0256.c ...) to the core MAME sources.
- 0.108u5            : Nathan Woods fixed crash in Windows code if we are unable to create sound buffers (windows\sound.c).
- 0.108u3            : David Haywood added workaround for crash in the sound code under some edge cases.
- 0.104u5            : Atari Ace and Aaron Giles cleaned up include files in CPU/sound cores. CPU cores should generally only need to include cpuintrf.h. Sound cores should generally only need to include sndintrf.h.
- 0.104u4            : Splitted sndintrf.c into src\sound.c/h, sndintrf.c and sndhrdw\generic.c/h [Aaron Giles].
- 0.103u5            : Added sound\sound.mak.
- 0.103u4            : Aaron Giles added stream_set_sample_rate() call, and converted the TMS5110, TMS5220, ES5505/6, BSMT2000, AY8910, POKEY, TIA, Sega PCM/Multi-PCM, SN76496, OKIM6295, and YMZ280B sound cores to output at their native sample rates, allowing the core sound system to perform over/re-sampling to the output rate.
- 0.102              : Aaron Giles removed ROMREGION_SOUNDONLY. Since -nosound no longer disables sound CPUs or sound cores (and hasn't for a while), failing to load sound ROMs was only leading to crashes.
- 0.99u9             : Aaron Giles fixed bug that caused the sound cores to keep running while paused.
- 0.94u2             : Aaron Giles removed some unwanted clamping code from sound core. Nathan Woods added entries for two MESS specific sound cores (C64/128) in src\sndintrf.c.
- 0.93u1             : Aaron Giles fixed running with -nosound.
- 0.93               : Sound System update [Aaron Giles]. sndintrf.c: Sound cores are now hooked up very much like CPU cores. There is a single get_info function that is public for each core; all other functions and data are retrieved through it. Similar to CPU cores, you can call sndtype_xxx() to query/set values for a specific sound chip type; you can also call sndnum_xxx() to query/set values for an indexed sound chip in the Machine->drv->sound array; finally, you can call sndti_xxx() to query/set values for the nth instance of any give sound chip type (sndti = sound type+index). At startup, all sound cores/filters are created. Then all the speakers are created. Finally, everything is wired up together. There are new consistency checks to make sure you don't do anything wildly bad. sndintrf.c calls the OSD layer now, and always requests stereo output. It also does a final downmix from the various speaker streams into left/right streams based on the X coordinate of the speaker. sndintrf.h: We now no longer #include every sound core's header. You have to include them yourself in your driver.
- 0.76u2             : Nathan Woods removed the update procedure in a MESS specific sound core.
- 0.76u1             : Nathan Woods removed wave_sh_stop() call from the MESS specific WAVE sound interface (it is extraneous now).
- 0.37b7             : Important for porters: The HAS_XXX constants for cpu and sound emulation are no longer #defined in cpuintrf.h if they were not already defined. They are set by the makefile (rules.mak). If you are not using that in your port, you'll have to make sure that all constants are initialized somewhere.
- 0.35b13            : struct GameSample no longer has a volume field (since it is not stored in .wav files), to replace that struct Samplesinterface has an additional volume field which affects all samples played [Nicola Salmoria]. Replaced osd_adjust_sample() with osd_set_sample_freq() and osd_set_sample_volume(), and the OSD_PAN_xxx macros with MIXER_PAN_xxx. Moved mixer control out of streams.c and into the new mixer.c. Now the On Screen Display can be used to change the volume of any channel, not just ones handled by streams.c. The configuration is also saved on exit and is automatically reloaded the next time you start the game [Nicola Salmoria].
- 0.35b10            : Reorganized the sound subsystems, hopefully I didn't break anything in the process [Nicola Salmoria].
- 0.35b9             : Changed sndhrdw\generic.c/h to src\sndintrf.c/h.
- 0.31               : Removed sndhrdw\waveform.c/h. Better handling of sound susbsystems, thanks to new fields in the MachineDriver structure. You can now use several susbystems at the same time, without any problem and without having to write sh_start(), sh_stop() and sh_update() functions. Samples have a better interface too.
- 0.30               : Added sndhrdw\waveform.c/h. New command line options, -sr N, where N is the required audio sample rate, and -sb N, where N is the number of sample bits (8 or 16). For example, MAME gyruss -sr 22050 -sb 16 will use a 22kHz sample rate and 16 bits. The -sb option currently doesn't change anything because none of the audio subsystems support 16 bit samples [Nicola Salmoria].
- 0.27               : Fixes to the audio code which should fix crashes on some games and compatibility problems with GUS and AWE 32 [Nicola Salmoria]. However let me stress once again that if you have an AWE 32 you should use the plain SoundBlaster driver. The AWE 32 driver sounds NOTHING like the original (and is slower). Increased the maximum number of digital audio channels from 8 to 16, so there are no more missing voices in the Mr. Do! games (Castle, Unicorns, Wild Ride, Run Run, and Kick Rider) [Nicola Salmoria].
- 0.20               : Nicola Salmoria changed GENERIC.C to add sound_command_latch_r(): this always return the last command, instead of 0, if there are no more pending commands. This was required by 1942.
- 0.08               : Better error checking in the sound initialization routines. It still sucks, but at least will notify of problems instead of locking up the emulation. The "0. Silence" driver also works. Removed the "-nosound" command line switch, replaced it with "-soundcard n" which allows to bypass the audio driver selection menu. Use "-soundcard 0" to turn off sound.

S1.1   Streams

- 0.154              : Removed not needed parameter from stream_alloc. It is set to same value in sound.c. Got rid of legacy STREAM_UPDATE, created stream_update_delegate and now stub is no longer needed, also made easy to have stream with different update call [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.153              : Flagged STREAM_UPDATE as legacy (emu\sound.h) [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.147u3            : Added more comment to lessen confusion regarding sound_stream::generate_resampled_data (emu\sound.c) [Anders Hallstrom].
- 0.141u2            : Merged emu\streams.c into emu\sound.c. C++-ified the sound and streams interfaces. Combined sound.c and streams.c into one file, and separated the speaker device into its own file. Generalized the concept of dynamically assigned inputs and re-wired the speaker to work this way, so it is now treated just like any other sound device. Added methods to the device_sound_interface for controlling output gain and mapping device inputs/outputs to stream inputs/outputs. Also made the sound_stream_update() method pure virtual, so all modern sound devices must use the new mechanism for stream updates [Aaron Giles].
- 0.135u2            : Aaron Giles switched from linear interpolation to antialiased point sampling when upconverting low-frequency sound streams. This should de-muffle low-frequency streams, treating them has having hard edges at sample boundaries.
- 0.128u7            : Atari Ace modified the parameters of the stream_update_func callback. As part of this work, macro-ized all the callbacks to STREAM_UPDATE, and added the sound device as a parameter.
- 0.128u6            : Atari Ace added the sound device to the parameters passed to stream_create so that the global Machine can be removed from streams.c.
- 0.124u2            : Aaron Giles fixed stereo output, sound comes mainly from right channel, left channel is barely audible.
- 0.112u4            : Aaron Giles fixed a number of issues related to the new streaming engine and sound code. Fixed crash when restoring from a save state. Fixed crash when running with -nosound. Fixed loud looping when halted in the debugger. Fixed crash when changing sample rates (YM2203 mainly). Fixed crash in K054539 sound core.
- 0.112u3            : Added osd\windows\sound.h. Aaron Giles simplified the OSD interface for sound. Removed osd_start_audio_stream and osd_stop_audio_stream; OSD initialization code is now responsible for initialization. Removed osd_get_mastervolume and osd_sound_enable, keeping management of the main volume in emu\sound.c. Changed sound streaming engine to be emulated time based instead of sample based. This means that emulation behavior is independent of the user-specified sample rate (except that some sound cores still use this value; to fixed in a future update). Also separated sound generation from video frame rate. Sound is now pushed to the OSD layer at a fixed rate of 50 updates per emulated second. This entailed a change in the way sound is handed to the OSD layer. Instead of the OSD layer requesting arbitrary numbers of samples each frame, the core now pushes the appropriate number of samples based on the emulated time. Simplified the OSD interface for sound. Removed osd_start_audio_stream and osd_stop_audio_stream; OSD initialization code is now responsible for initialization. Removed osd_get_mastervolume and osd_sound_enable, keeping management of the main volume in emu\sound.c.
- 0.112u1            : Moved src\streams.c/h to src\emu\.
- 0.110u3            : Aaron Giles removed obsolete timing parameter from stream_update().
- 0.104              : Moved src\sound\streams.c/h to src\.
- 0.101u1            : Aaron Giles added save state information for streams so that dynamic volume changes get properly restored. Unfortunately this breaks all existing save states.
- 0.100              : Aaron Giles fixed crash in some games when using a low sample rate or -nosound.
- 0.94               : Aaron Giles removed extraneous clipping when passing streams from one output to the next input.
- 0.93u1             : Sound system update fixes [Aaron Giles]. Added streams engine oversamples by averaging now. Removed some obsolete code from the streams code. Removed obsolete macro in sound\streams.c.
- 0.93               : Removed sound\mixer.c/h. Sound System update [Aaron Giles]. sound\streams.c: Added a new type defined in sound\streams.h: stream_sample_t, which is used to represent a sample as used by the stream system. It is typedef'd to an INT32. Regardless of the size of stream_sample_t, all streams should be generated as if 16 bits were the maximum. The extra bits give us headroom to overdrive things if we want. All streams have the same format callback, with support for multiple inputs and outputs. Each stream has a sample rate; inputs to that stream will be down/upsampled to that rate; outputs will be down/upsampled as necessary to connect to the input of the next stream/speaker in line. Each input to a stream has its own gain, and each output has a gain as well. These can be controlled while things are running to provide some extra volume knobs. I haven't done much in the way of optimizations in order to keep things simple and working. Once things are back to normal, I may consider some additional optimizations.
- 0.36b15            : stream_init() and stream_init_multi() no longer have a sample_bits parameter. Sound emulators are required to generate 16-bit samples. Also removed osd_play_streamed_sample() and mixer_play_streamed_sample(): only the 16-bit version is available now.
- 0.35b13            : Moved mixer control out of streams.c and into the new mixer.c. Now the On Screen Display can be used to change the volume of any channel, not just ones handled by streams.c. The configuration is also saved on exit and is automatically reloaded the next time you start the game [Nicola Salmoria]. struct GameSample no longer has a volume field (since it is not stored in .wav files), to replace that struct Samplesinterface has an additional volume field which affects all samples played [Nicola Salmoria]. Replaced osd_adjust_sample() with osd_set_sample_freq() and osd_set_sample_volume(), and the OSD_PAN_xxx macros with MIXER_PAN_xxx.
- 0.35b6             : New option -volume n to set the startup volume. The volume is an attenuation in dB, e. g. "-volume -12" will start with a -12dB attenuation [Nicola Salmoria].
- 0.34b4             : Added sndhrdw\streams.c/h. New streams.c to abstract audio streams. This makes them easier to use and more efficient. osd_play_streamed_sample() should now be considered a private function and should not be used in new code [Nicola Salmoria].

S1.2   Mixer

- 0.173              : Merged sound\filter.cpp/h with audio\polepos.cpp/h [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.145u7            : Enhanced the mixer interface support to allow for more than one output line. To use this you need to use the MCFG_MIXER_ROUTE macro instead of MCFG_SOUND_ROUTE so that the mixer output index can be specified. See midway_ssio_device for an example [Aaron Giles].
- 0.123u5            : Nicola Salmoria fixed loading mixer settings when the driver default value is calculated.
- 0.93               : Removed sound\mixer.c.
- 0.85u2             : Aaron Giles fixed bug that prevented the mixer from loading data unless all channels had been modified.
- 0.84u5             : Andrea Mazzoleni fixed the mixer code so it doesn't crash if the OSD layer returns an error.
-  7th March     2001: Andrea Mazzoleni improved the mixer system to include an adjustable low pass filter, which will be used with the Darius 2 driver.
- 0.37b12            : Added sound\filter.c/h. New filtering code for the audio mixer. It is applied to audio streams generated at a sampling rate different from the sound card's one, improving quality. Some examples with a very audible difference are: fantasy, polyplay, galaxian (the background effect when playing), nibbler, vanguard and all the Seta games.
- 19th December  2000: Hiromitsu Shioya added some expanded volume setting functions to the mixer system.
- 0.36b16            : mixer.c now does all sound mixing, generating one single sample stream, played using the new osd_XXX_audio_stream() functions. All other OS dependant sample functions (osd_play_sample() etc.) have been removed. This should standardize the sound output across ports, and allow porters to write much cleaner sound code [Aaron Giles].
- 0.36b15            : Source: Added gain support to mixer.c, through the new MIXERG() macro (extension of MIXER()). Removed the gain filed from AY8910, YM2203, YM2610 structures.
- 0.35b13            : Added sound\mixer.c/h. Moved mixer control out of streams.c and into the new mixer.c.



S1.3   Sound filter

- 0.179              : Update stream before setting the new gain (sound\flt_vol.cpp) [smf].
- 0.148u1            : Modernize the Volume and RC filter sound devices (emu\sound\flt_rc.c/h, flt_vol.c/h, audio\scramble.c, timeplt.c, drivers\darius.c, ddribble.c, galaxold.c, junofrst.c, lockon.c, megazone.c, ninjaw.c, othunder.c, scramble.c, taito_z.c, tp84.c, warriorb.c, xexex.c, includes\darius.h, lockon.h, ninjaw.h, othunder.h, warriorb.h, xexex.h) [Andrew Gardner].
- 0.93               : Filter (volume) this is a new very simple filter that can be used to control the volume of a stream if you need an extra knob. Filter (RC) -- this is a new filter that replaces the old RC filter that was in the streams code. Eventually, this could get replaced by some simple discrete logic [Aaron Giles].
-  8th March     2001: David Graves adjusted the Darius 2 and Ninja Warriors drivers to include support for the low pass filter.
-  7th March     2001: Andrea Mazzoleni improved the mixer system to include an adjustable low pass filter, which will be used with the Darius 2 driver.
- 0.37b12            : Added sound\filter.c/h.
- 14th February  2001: Andrea Mazzoleni added a nice filtering sound resampling algorithm for the driver that do not produce sound at the requested sample rate.
- 28th June      1999: Tatsuyuki Satoh fixed the VLM5030 and RC filter interface in Double Dribble. Nicola Salmoria fixed the filter interface in Time Pilot 84.
- 30th March     1999: Tatsuyuki Satoh modified the RC filter to be external and separated it from streams system.
- 0.35b8             : Zsolt Vasvari implemented the RC filters in early Konami games (Time Pilot, Pooyan, etc.).
- 18th March     1999: Zsolt Vasvari has added RC filter functions to all the games which use the Time Pilot sound board.
- 0.34b3 : Francesco Caporali added RC filter emulation to Gyruss. This improves some sound effects, e.g. the force field noise.
- SOURCE: Added sound\filter.cpp



S1.4   Speaker

- 0.184              : Changed sound\speaker.cpp/h to sound\spkrdev.cpp/h.
- 0.141u2            : Splitted emu\speaker.c/h from emu\sound.c. C++-ified the sound and streams interfaces. Combined sound.c and streams.c into one file, and separated the speaker device into its own file. Generalized the concept of dynamically assigned inputs and re-wired the speaker to work this way, so it is now treated just like any other sound device. Added methods to the device_sound_interface for controlling output gain and mapping device inputs/outputs to stream inputs/outputs. Also made the sound_stream_update() method pure virtual, so all modern sound devices must use the new mechanism for stream updates [Aaron Giles].
- 0.135u2            : Curt Coder actually use the speaker interface if provided.
- 0.133u2            : Anders Hallstrom improved speaker-toggle emulation with alias filter.
- 0.123u3            : Converted speakers into devices. Machine->config no longer houses an array of speakers; instead they are iterated through using the new macros (defined in sound.h) speaker_output_first() and speaker_output_next(). Updated all relevant code to do this [Aaron Giles].
- 0.112u1            : Moved src\sound.c to emu\sound.c.
- 0.104u4            : Splitted src\sound.c/h from src\sndintrf.c/h [Aaron Giles].
- 0.94u2             : Derrick Renaud fixed some speaker settings.
- 0.35b9             : Changed sndhrdw\generic.c/h to src\sndintrf.c/h.
- NOTES: Loud speaker output sound device.

S1.5   Discrete Sound

- 0.186              : Changed name 'DISCRETE' to 'Discrete Sound'.
- 0.180              : Use osd_getenv instead of getenv (sound\discrete.cpp) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.174              : Changed sound\disc_dev.inc, disc_flt.inc, disc_inp.inc, disc_mth.inc, disc_sys.inc and disc_wav.inc to disc_dev.hxx, disc_flt.hxx, disc_inp.hxx, disc_mth.hxx, disc_sys.hxx and disc_wav.hxx.
- 0.170              : Getting rid of global_alloc_array_clear at least, clearing is essential to objects in vector_t so that is why previous attempt did not work (sound\discrete.h) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.155              : Removed static config for discrete (MCFG_SOUND_CONFIG_DISCRETE() --> MCFG_DISCRETE_INTF()). Removed static config in RC filter and small cleanup (sound\flt_rc.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.153              : Changed sound\disc_dev.c to disc_dev.inc, disc_flt.c to disc_flt.inc, disc_inp.c to disc_inp.inc, disc_mth.c to disc_mth.inc, disc_sys.c to disc_sys.inc and disc_wav.c to disc_wav.inc [Oliver Stöneberg]. discrete_sound_w and discrete_sound_r not used any more since discrete_device is modern one [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.152              : No more dynamic allocations in static constructors in discrete audio [Couriersud].
- 0.150              : Small DEVICE_STOP, DEVICE_RESET and DEVICE_START cleanup in sound\discrete.c [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.149u1            : Fixed number of active inputs in several discrete macros. Added missing node in DISCRETE_INVERTER_OSC. Some whitespace change [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.148u4            : Discrete lookups removal (atarifb.c, cliffhgr.c, firetrk.c, goldnpkr.c, grchamp.c, hitme.c, madalien.c, mw8080bw.c, norautp.c, skydiver.c, sprint2.c, sprint4.c, starshp1.c, subs.c, tank8.c, triplhnt.c, uapce.c, ultratnk.c, videopin.c and wiz) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.141u2            : Derrick Renaud fixed DISCRETE_WAVLOG & DISCRETE_RCFILTER fixing dkongjr and likely other sounds.
- 0.141u1            : Added emu\sound\disc_cls.h, disc_dev.h, disc_flt.h, disc_mth.h and disc_wav.h. Changed name 'Discrete' to 'DISCRETE'. Discrete sound system [Couriersud]: All nodes are now class based. Removed all support for "legacy", i.e. procedural node functions. Nodes are created using a class factory whose instances are set up in discrete blocks. There is no separation of node vs. module any longer. Custom modules are now just implemented like "normal" nodes. Converted all custom modules. Context variables can now be migrated to be private class members. All list handling now based on dynamic_array_t (discrete.h). More code rewrite to get rid of fixed allocations. Performance about the same as 0.140. Start moving the discrete subsystem towards C++. Changed some structs to classes and most of the list processing now uses a linked list template which is type-safe. Changed the discrete sound system to be class based: Former modules are now classes being derived from discrete_base_node. Moved all context variables to be private class members. For "standard nodes", DISCRETE_CLASS_STEP_RESET provides a simple way to implement a node. All information around a node (additional info struct, constants and input mappings may be defined on a class level centralizing all information. An example is dss_inverter_osc. Significantly simplified the task handling. Fixed a bug which would not buffer secondary outputs. All lists in sound\disc_* are now based on dynamic_array_t (discrete.h). Changed all drivers to reflect the changes. Custom modules are now just another node class. No performance hit observed due to these changes. Couriersud optimized RC_INTEGRATE and TRANSFORM. Nice improvement. Couriersud changed all "output[0] = ..." into "set_output(0, ..)" calls. Rewrote modules using "output[0]" as a latch as well. The purpose is to decouple nodes from the discrete infrastructure implementation. Discrete subsystem now uses the sound_device stream_update function. Carved out a discrete_sound_device from discrete_device. This now has all the stream related code. discrete_device thus now contains all the generic code and may be used going forward to implement not sound related use cases.
- 0.140u1            : Derrick Renaud added DISCRETE_XTIME_xxx logic modules. These allow you to do logic operations on nodes that use x_time anti-alias info. Added the ability to decode x_time to the DISCRETE_BIT_DECODE module. This means you can have an oscillator pass x_time onto a counter, get the counter bits decoded, pass that through the new logic modules and also have them convert the x_time to energy/anti-alaised voltage. Updated Donkey Kong Jr. to use these new modules. Discrete Updates [Derrick Renaud]: Removed old DISCRETE_74LS624 code and replaced it with new 74LS629 based code. Updated Mario to use new DISCRETE_74LS624 and DISCRETE_XTIME_logic modules. Derrick Renaud optimized speed of DISCRETE_DAC_R1. Derrick Renaud fixed operation of DISCRETE_COUNTER_7492.
- 0.136u4            : MASH fixed a bug in emu\sound\disc_mth.c. This affected spiders.c fire sound.
- 0.135u4            : Aaron Giles removed old index-based DISCRETE_ADJUSTMENT and then renamed the newer DISCRETE_ADJUSTMENT_TAG to replace it. Updated all callers.
- 0.134u4            : Discrete sound improvements [Couriersud]: DSS_INVERTER_OSC optimizations. OSD_PROFILING is now an environment variable. No more recompiling to turn profiling on. Added two asserts to task processing. Derrick Renaud converted final mixing stage to DISCRETE_MIXER. This adds the missing filtering on the Mario Bros walking sounds. Derrick Renaud promoted DISCRETE_RC_CIRCUIT_1 for Sky Raider custom charge to it's own module so it could be used with the same circuit in Battlezone. Derrick Renaud added DISCRETE_COUNTER MIN parameter and optimized speed.
- 0.134u3            : Discrete update [Couriersud]: Fixed some "const" weirdness I introduced. Fixed VREF in CRFILTER_VREF and RCFILTER_VREF. VREF never got used since it was only a static parameter. Removed enable from CR_FILTER* and RC_FILTER*. Updated drivers accordingly. Added EXPECTED macro to complement the already existing UNEXPECTED macro. Use EXPECTED/UNEXPECTED macros to help the compiler. DISCRETE_CRFILTER, DISCRETE_RCFILTER updates [Derrick Renaud]: Revert vref change from rev 6979. Added capability for all values to be nodes. Better task processing for discrete sounds [Couriersud]: Tasks are now processed according to their dependency lists. Tasks can now start early and will only process samples which are already available. This has most impact on drivers which have significant variance in the run-time of individual tasks. Tasks now process samples in slices, currently max 240 samples / slice. TASK_GROUP is now obsolete - Will update drivers at a later stage. Step function pointer now back in node, modules may register optimized step functions. Profiling code now always compiled, introduced static int "profiling = ...". Some more EXPECTED/UNEXPECTED usage.
- 0.134u2            : discrete_sound_r now can inquiry any node [Couriersud]: The return type is UINT8, consequently the designer needs to ensure that the node delivers adequately scaled data. Input nodes allow the input data to be scaled. The return value is the node value *after* scaling. DISCRETE_74LS624 - optimized for some more speed [Derrick Renaud]. Derrick Renaud started making a more accurate simulation of the DISCRETE_566 based on testing of a real IC. This makes the rest of Sky Raider sounds work. DISCRETE_555_MSTABLE - optimized speed and added new operating modes [Derrick Renaud]. Implemented m:n logic for buffered task nodes in discrete sound [Couriersud]: Preparation work so that a task node output buffer may be read by more than one following task. target: implementation of task groups: tasks in a task group run parallel, task groups serial. The current main task may than just be task (in the last task group). exp is slow, but pow is even slower (sound\disc_dev.c) [Couriersud]: More LS624 optimization, replace pow(10, x) by pow10(x). Mixer loop optimizations. Discrete task groups [Couriersud]: DISCRETE_TASK_START now requires a parameter TASK_GROUP (>=0, <=9). Tasks are scheduled in the order of their task group. Nodes are automatically buffered between task groups. Discrete core determines nodes which need buffering to minimize overhead (information in DISCRETE_LOG). A discrete block list now must put each stepped node into a task if it uses tasks. Drivers not using tasks will get one task allocated automatically. Updated drivers accordingly. Some more constification.
- 0.134u1            : Couriersud and Derrick Renaud removed Enable Input from a number of discrete sound modules. Discrete Updates [Derrick Renaud]: Added DISCRETE_LOGIC_SHIFT - generic shift register. Fixed DISCRETE_BIT_DECODE to apply proper voltage instead of clipping to INT. Optimized DISCRETE_74LS624 making dkongjr and mario faster [Derrick Renaud].
- 0.133u5            : Added sound\disc_sys.c. Discrete sound updates [Couriersud]: Fixed comments for DISCRETE_TRANSFORM. FatalError if formula is bad. Fixed two bugs in DISCRETE_RCDISC3. Fixed some ugly bugs around DISCRETE_FILTER_SW: No more iterations. The CD4066 internal resistance largely determines sound amplitude. This may vary significantly depending on VCC and type (74HC, 74HCV, CD4066, ...). The current choice makes scramble sound "about right". Added some profiling code for discrete tasks. Added DISCRETE_INPUT_BUFFER to use a stream to buffer an input node. For input nodes with a lot of writes this prevents a stream_update on the whole discrete module which is very ineffective. Instead, the data is buffered and the discrete emulation can process a lot of samples in one go later. Added disc_syc.c as a container for core modules (output, task). Discrete wav and csv logs now are treated as nodes. Added DISCRETE_START and DISCRETE_STOP functions to be called at device start/stop. As a side effect, profiling measures log overhead as well. DSO_TASK_END now builds it's own dependence list - now simply DSO_TASK_END() ends a task. Added node parameter to RC_(DIS)CHARGE_EXP. Added const where appropriate. Removed some dead code.
- 0.133u4            : Discrete sound improvements [Couriersud]: DISCRETE_RCDISC3: Added diode junction voltage; junction voltage also indicates polarity. DISCRETE_OPAMP_FILTER: Added type DISC_OP_AMP_FILTER_IS_LOW_PASS_1M; INP2 takes role of v_ref in this type. DISCRETE_OPAMP: Fixed a bug (possible divide by 0). DISCRETE_LFSR: Fixed bug preventing output of shift reg to sub node 1. Discrete work [Couriersud]: Change the way custom modules are handled. Updated drivers mario and dkong accordingly. Minor change to stream input handling. No more linear lists for nodes. All node processing switched to linked lists. Module step and reset now only get a node pointer passed. Added discrete_info * pointer to node. Only nodes with a step routine actually get processed. Fixed discrete logs did not work since some time bug. Preliminary parallel task constants; depending on results these may vanish again. Overall slight performance increase. dkong 940% to 960% and galaxian 740% to 790%. Discrete sound parallel tasks support [Couriersud]: Introduced DISCRETE_TASK_START and DISCRETE_TASK_END. DISCRETE_TASK_START: Start a new task. A task is a set of nodes which only depend on input nodes and nodes in the set. DISCRETE_TASK_END(task_output_node): Marks the end of the task. task_output_node is the node whose output over time should be preserved. This node can be accessed by nodes in the main thread. Illustrated the concept in the dkong discrete emulation. This also has been enhanced to buffer DAC output. Discrete tasks now support multiple task output nodes. Further discrete changes [Couriersud]: DISCRETE_OUTPUT now is a stepping node. DISCRETE_STREAM_INPUT now advances input pointer in step. More linked_list usage. Continued discrete sound system "list-ification" [Couriersud]: No more constraints on number of input and output nodes. Input nodes now make use of a context.
- 0.133u3            : Discrete sound update [Couriersud]: Removed global variable discrete_current_context. Discrete_info is now passed instead of device, we may get device by using disc_info->device. Added DISCRETE_IMPORT(*block): Imports another discrete block. Added DISCRETE_REMOVE(node1, node2): Removes a range of nodes. Added DISCRETE_REPLACE: Next node replaces existing node, thus preserving run order. Added DISCRETE_NOP(node): Does nothing, to be replaced. Added a prescanning stage to build final block list after execution of the above. The additions provide an easy way to document subtle difference between boards. Please see audio\galaxian.c for an example. DSS_COUNTER updates [Couriersud]: Clock_node no longer needs to be static for DISC_CLK_IS_FREQ. Rewrote inc/dec logic to avoid loop. Added DISCRETE_BIT(S)_DECODE [Couriersud]: Decodes individual bits from input values. Updated drivers which had macro DISCRETE_BITSET (which was a bit misleading). This should be slightly faster than using DISCRETE_TRANSROM. Discrete sound enhancements [Couriersud]: Put some life into RCDISC5 enable mode. This now acts as a switch between R and C. Capacitor voltage will be preserved if disabled. Made galaxian use the above. Saved 2 nodes and increased accuracy. Added DISC_LFSR_FLAG_OUTPUT_SR_SN1 flag to shift register noise generator. This will output the value of the shift register to sub-node 1. This is needed for future bzone discrete sound emulation. BTW: RCDISC5 will be used as well. Left a note on RCDISC3 on what is needed to be implemented for bzone. Optimized the LFSR a bit. LFSRs running at high frequency (> sample_freq) should benefit. Galaxian sound updates [Couriersud]: Moon Cresta and Galaxian now have their respective schematics emulated, i.e. Moon Cresta has a slightly different mixing stage. Cleaned up driver, added some section titles and comments, removed old code. Removed emu_timer, this was causing a stream of stream_updates only updating 3 samples. Replaced with discrete timer module DSS_TIMER now. Use DISCRETE_NOTE for pitch generation; it is more accurate (within the one ms where the pitch changes) and saves a node. Use DISCRETE_BITS_DECODE and save 2 nodes.
- 0.133u2            : Discrete sound update [Couriersud]: Added "abs" function to DISCRETE_TRANSFORM. Fixed a bug in DISCRETE_RCDISC5.
- 0.129u3            : Several discrete sound refinements, mainly targeted at Mario Bros [Couriersud]: Use formula derived from figures 2 and 3 in LS624 datasheet. Coefficients were calculated using least square approximation. This approach gives a bit better audible results compared to the prior approach. Fixed energy calculation for LS624. Use energy values as input for XOR. This seems to better reflect the superimposition of the two signals. On the long term, both LS629 and the XOR need to be converted into a custom module to properly model mixing if the two frequencies are close to each other. Adjusted C41 to 60% for skid sound.
- 0.128u4            : abc_step and abc_reset now declared as DISCRETE_STEP( abc ) and DISCRETE_RESET( abc ) [Couriersud]. Fixed state save in discrete sound [Couriersud]: sndindex now considered as well in state save. Expose discrete_sound_n_r(void *chip, ...) to enable accessing multiple discrete sound cores.
- 0.128u2            : More Discrete module optimizations [Derrick Renaud]: Added optimized custom mixer to Donkey Kong. R. Belmont fixed GCC 4.3 "array bounds exceeded" error in disc_flt.c.
- 0.127u2            : Optimized DISCRETE_RCDISC_MODULATED. Added X_TALs to circus. Optimized DISCRETE_RCINTEGRATE and DISCRETE_555_ASTABLE. Optimized DISCRETE_555_ASTABLE_CV and DISCRETE_MIXER. Optimized DISCRETE_555_CC. The 555 and mixer changes also speed up just about every current discrete game [Derrick Renaud]. Derrick Renaud started removing extraneous enable lines from the discrete modules. Most modules are always enabled anyways.
- 0.127u1            : Derrick Renaud cleaned up the discrete code and fixed discrete logging.
- 0.126u5            : Changed includes\rescap.h to machine\rescap.h.
- 0.126u4            : Minor optimization to the DISCRETE_INPUT modules. The node output is now calculated when a discrete_sound_w() is called instead of each step in the simulation. Also removed the Enable line from the DISCRETE_ADJUSTMENT modules. They should never be disabled [Derrick Renaud]. Discrete sound core optimizations [Couriersud]: Moved a couple of exp(x) from _step into _reset where appropriate. Use tabulated function values for the transfer function in DSS_INVERTER_OSC. Couriersud added module profiling to discrete sound core: Added DISCRETE_PROFILING macro to discrete.h. Upon discrete_stop, the worst performing modules will be listed.
- 0.125u4            : Discrete sound update [Couriersud]: Added NODE_RELATIVE(NODE, offset) macro to discrete.h. Fixed asteroid.c, canyon.c, skydiver.c and tank8.c to use this macro instead of adding directly to the node.
- 0.124u5            : Couriersud added DISCRETE_KEY_SALLEN_FILTER to discrete sound system.
- 0.124u4            : Couriersud fixed a bug in disc_flt.c (konami filters). Fixed discrete sound and konami filter addressing in galaxian driver.
- 0.124u1            : Discrete sound system improvements [Couriersud]: Added DISCRETE_RCFILTER_SW to discrete sound. This implements multiple RC networks with CD4066 switches to connect/disconnect capacitor. Implemented discrete mixing in circusc using DISCRETE_RCFILTER_SW and sound routing to route 76416 output to discrete logic. Added discrete filtering and mixing to galaxian.c games using konami_sound. Fixed timing of stream_update in discrete_sound_w. All sound cores update before processing changed data. Added stream_update to discrete_sound_r. Now supports multiple output nodes per module. In this case, NODE_XXX is the default output. Alternative outputs may be accessed by using NODE_XXX_YY where 00<Y<08. You may also access nodes with macros: NODE_XXX = NODE_SUB(XXX, 0), NODE_XXX = NODE(XXX) and NODE_XXX_YY = NODE_SUB(XXX, YY) with YY != 00. This should e.g. make discrete sound emulation easier when dealing with e.g. flip flops (Q & QQ) and binary counters. Added sanity checks to check consistency issues introduced by this change. Modules specify number of outputs ==> Certain special modules (WAVELOG) may no longer be used as input nodes. Removed explicit (NODE_XX + expr) from a couple of drivers.
- 0.122u7            : Couriersud fixed DISCRETE_INPUT_STREAM and added input channel # to DISCRETE_INPUT_STREAM.
- 0.119u2            : Atari Ace added macros to clean up definitions of the discrete sound interfaces. At the same time, made them all const.
- 0.117u1            : Couriersud added two inverter oscillators supporting enable and mixing in signals to discrete.h / disc_wav.c.
- 0.116u3            : Couriersud extended the flt_rc filter to support highpass filtering. Fixed the lowpass filter to actually do a lowpass filter. Hooked up the filter to King & Balloon and updated several other drivers to the new interface.
- 0.116              : Added new components to the discrete sound system [Couriersud]: Added a "inverter oscillator" component. This can also be used as a raw sine generator - needed by radarscp. Added a "integration circuit" based on transistor and RC. Added a "modulated RC discharge" component.
- 0.113              : Derrick Renaud fixed regressions in 3 of the discrete games from 0.112u4.
- 0.112u4            : New DISCRETE_ADJUSTMENT_TAG module that uses tags instead of port numbers. Updated all games to use it, because it is now the preferred method. Added Discrete sound to Checkmate [Derrick Renaud].
- 0.112u3            : Derrick Renaud updated the DISCRETE_OP_AMP_OSCILLATOR circuit to get it ready for a future driver. It allows the DISC_OP_AMP_OSCILLATOR_1 | DISC_OP_AMP_IS_NORTON oscillator to use nodes to adjust the resistance values instead of only being static values. Derrick also added discrete sound for Amazing Maze. And added new Discrete modules: DISCRETE_LOOKUP_TABLE & DISCRETE_LOGIC_JKFLIPFLOP.
- 0.106u2            : Discrete sound updates [Derrick Renaud]: Typedef'ed external discrete sound structures to follow current structure use. Statically defined their use in most drivers to stop name pollution. Created new DISCRETE_555_VCO1 module. This is the 555&Op-amp oscillator circuit used by Borderline.
-  8th May 2006      : Frank Palazzolo - For a while now, I've been wanting to experiment with new methods of high-speed circuit simulation. The idea would be to prototype some discrete-audio stuff, possibly for MAME, using something like Python. After looking into the requirements, I realized that I needed to handle polynomials with a single variable, and ratios of these polynomials. Also, I needed to be able to handle real or complex variables. I looked around on the web, and I found that SciPy (http://www.scipy.org/) is finally coming along nicely on Windows. However, I wasn't entirely happy with the root finder they use. Along the way, I also found the ratfun (http://calcrpnpy.sourceforge.net/ratfunManual.html) package, which looked perfect, but was unsupported on Windows. I dug in and in a couple weekends, got it building under Windows. I think I'll be using it for the experiments, whenever I get back to it.
- 0.103u5            : Changed includes\rc.h to includes\rescap.h. Discrete sound updates [Derrick Renaud]: Added new DISCRETE_CSVLOG module that lets you log discrete nodes as CSV (comma separated values) data. Modified discrete core to use the clock specified in the MDRV_SOUND_ADD line. If the clock is specified as 0, then the discrete emulation will default to the audio sample rate clock. Tweaked Phoenix Effect 2 sound to be more accurate matching oscilliscope data. Changed the Phoenix discrete clock rate to a fixed rate of 120000 allowing the simulation to be more accurate with less alaising noise at the cost of speed. Fixed the bug in the DISCRETE_NOTE module that produced notes 1 count off.
- 0.103u4            : Derrick Renaud added/changed the following discrete modules: DISCRETE_WAVELOG - Easy way to log discrete nodes as a .wav file to compare against scope waveforms. DISCRETE_OUTPUT - Added a final gain parameter to get it to 16 bit wav level (the old VOL setting was disabled after the last sound re-write).
- 0.102u5            : Frank Palazzolo fixed bug in discrete filtering code.
- 0.99u6             : Discrete sound update: Added DST_RCDISC5 (Diode in series with R/C), added DST_ASWITCH (analog switch), added LFSR functions DISC_LFSR_XOR_INV_IN0 and DISC_LFSR_XOR_INV_IN1 and fixed DSD_555_ASTBL__R2.
- 0.99u2             : Derrick Renaud fixed the discrete sound 555 timer modules when using actual DC mode.
- 0.94u1             : Changed name 'RC_Filter' to 'RC Filter' and 'Volume_Filter' to 'Volume Filter'. Discrete sound updates [Derrick Renaud]. Added DSS_INPUT_STREAM (Connects external streams to the discrete system). Added magnitude conversions macro (includes\rc.h).
- 0.93u1             : Discrete Sound Update [Derrick Renaud]: Various tweaks to the discrete modules and updated all drivers to use new code. DISCRETE_COUNTER, DISCRETE_LFSR_NOISE, DISCRETE_NOTE - added different clocking types to be more flexable. DISCRETE_COUNTER_FIX - removed and merged with DISCRETE_COUNTER. New Discrete Modules: DISCRETE_DIODE_MIXERx - Mixes signals through diodes. DISCRETE_MULTIPLEXx - 1 of 2/4/8 signal multiplexer. DISCRETE_RCDISC4 - Various charge/discharge circuits.
- 0.93               : Added sound\flt_rc.c/h and flt_vol.c/h. Changed name 'Discrete_Components' to 'Discrete'.
- 0.90u2             : New Sound Functionality [Derrick Renaud]. Took Frank Palazzolo's DISCRETE_FILTER2 code and made it work outside of the discrete system (see sound\filter.h for new functions).
- 0.90               : New Discrete Sound Functionality [Derrick Renaud, Frank Palazzolo]. Properly emulated DISC_OP_AMP_FILTER_IS_BAND_PASS_1M type filter used by many games ( see http://home.cogeco.ca/~derrickmame/galaga/Galaga_filters.html). Re-wrote atarifb and abaseb to use component value only code and new filter.
- 0.89               : Discrete Sound Update [Derrick Renaud]. Modified Discrete core node inputs to use pointers to the data, instead of moving the data into the inputs at each step. This speeds up discrete emulation. Modified all current modules and drivers to use new code. Added new Discrete Modules: DISCRETE_555_ASTABL has been modified to remove control voltage support and DISCRETE_555_ASTABL_CV has been added if control voltage is used.
- 0.88u4             : Discrete Sound Update [Derrick Renaud]: * Removed the memory mapping system from the discrete inputs. It served no purpose and was never functional. It only added a layer of confusion to the code by forcing it's use on all current drivers that do not need it. If memory mapped inputs are needed in the future (not likely), then they can be added with a DISCRETE_INPUT_MAP function. * Now the discrete inputs are written to by their node name only, eg: discrete_sound_w(NODE_xx, data). * DISCRETE_INPUT and DISCRETE_INPUTX have been removed in favour of new easier to use input modules. * Modified all current drivers to use new code. * Moved discrete sound code from drivers and put in sndhrdw\. New Discrete Modules: * DISCRETE_INPUT_DATA(node)  - accepts 8-bit data from discrete_sound_w. Output at reset is 0. * DISCRETE_INPUT_LOGIC(node) - 0 if data=0; 1 if data=!0. Output at reset is 0. * DISCRETE_INPUT_NOT(node)   - 0 if data=!0; 1 if data=0. Output at reset is 1. * DISCRETE_INPUTX_DATA(node, gain, offset, init). * DISCRETE_INPUTX_LOGIC(node, gain, offset, init) and * DISCRETE_INPUTX_NOT(node, gain, offset, init) - same as above, but will modify the output by the given GAIN and OFFSET. At reset the output will be INIT modified by GAIN and OFFSET.
- 0.88u2             : Brad Oliver fixed bug in discrete code. Derrick Renaud added an option to DISCRETE_555_ASTABLE to use quick charge diode (will be needed for Frogs) and an option to disable oscillation if R1 (charge) is out of circuit (will be needed by Invaders). Modified DISCRETE_555_CC to discharge cap due to natural losses if there is no charging current (needed by Frogs). This makes it more accurate then the current perfect cap that will retain a charge forever. Modified all current drivers to use new code. Added the new discrete module DISCRETE_555_MSTABLE (555 monostable simulation).
- 0.88               : Discrete Sound System update [Derrick Renaud]. Continued cleanup of code to make it more readable. New Discrete Modules: DISCRETE_NOTE - counter circuit used to create tones/music, DISCRETE_INTEGRATE - various op amp integration (ramp) circuits and DISCRETE_OP_AMP_TRIG_VCA - Did not know what to call this ( Basically it is a programable voltage controlled amp. But uses only an on/off trigger. It has resistors to select the rise/fall times. Also it is not a true VCA. It actually adjusts amplitude by clipping more/less off the bottom of the input signal. But it is a common circuit.).
- 0.80u2             : Removed sound\disc_out.c. Discrete Sound System updates [Aaron Giles, Derrick Renaud]. Aaron Giles: Major internal cleanup and reworking of how nodes are created. Fixed bug in 555 timer that led to whiny noise in Hit Me. Added new input port type for analog adjuster. Changed OSD interface for discrete sound adjusters to use the new input port type. Changed NODE_ADJUSTMENT to get its value from an input port. Adjuster values are now saved in the config file. Cchanged all games using adjusters to use the new system. Derrick Renaud: Discrete Sound Changes: Continued cleanup of code to make it more readable. New Discrete modules added: DISCRETE_OP_AMP_OSCILLATOR - various op amp oscillator circuits that are entered using component values. DISCRETE_OP_AMP_VCO - various op amp voltage controlled oscillator circuits that are entered using component values. Game Driver Changes: Finished updating games to use Aaron's DISCRETE_ADJUSTMENT changes.
- 17th March     2004: Aaron Giles - I've been doing some internal cleanup of the discrete sound system, and have modified the way analog adjusters are handled so that they are saved in the .cfg file.
- 0.80u1             : Improved Discrete Sound System [Aaron Giles]: New node type DISCRETE_LOGIC_DFLIPFLOP. Changed the way multichannel output is done; affects some existing drivers. Support for up to 16 channels of sound. Discrete sound support for Hit Me.
- 0.80               : Discrete sound updates [Derrick Renaud]: Fixed/added more documentation of functions at top of discrete.h, DISCRETE_555_ASTABLE - changed to use common options with DISCRETE_555_CC and DISCRETE_TRANSFORMx - fixed bug that preformed math in the wrong order. Also added more math functions. New Discrete Modules Added: DISCRETE_555_CC - Constant Current based 555 VCO with 8 main configurations, that automatically configure from components used, DISCRETE_566 - NE566 simulation, DISCRETE_COMP_ADDER - Multiple parallel capacitor/resistor circuit, DISCRETE_DAC_R1 - R1 Ladder DAC that automatically configures from components used, DISCRETE_MIXERx - Resistor/Op Amp mixer stage with filtering that calulates proper gains & filtering. It automatically configure from components used and DISCRETE_SCHMITT_OSCILLATOR - VCO based on a Schmitt Inverter. Game Driver Changes: poolshrk - Converted to new component value only code, firetrk, montecar, superbug - Converted to new component value only code. Pulled discrete code out and put in sndhrdw\ataridis.c. montecar still needs filtering on crash sound, atarifb, canyon & skydiver - minor changes to work with new code and triplhnt - added component value discrete sound, but have not figured out Shot and Bear Roar video memory locations. These are needed to make sound effects work.
- 0.78u5             : Discrete sound system updates [Derrick Renaud]: Fixed/added more documentation of functions at top of discrete.h. Fixed bug that allowed DISCRETE_RCFILTER module to use nodes not available to it. Added new Discrete modules: High pass R/C filter (DISCRETE_CRFILTER), presettable up/down counter with external clock and selectable count edge (DISCRETE_COUNTER), presettable up/down counter with bult-in frequency generator (DISCRETE_COUNTER_FIX), selectable edge trigger / re-trigger / output active state (DISCRETE_ONESHOT) and the same with reset (DISCRETE_ONESHOTR). R. Belmont fixed discrete sound system crash with -nosound.
- 0.69               : Fixed the 'no stereo' bug in src\sound\discrete.c [BUT]. Derrick Renaud fixed a minor bug in src\sound\discrete.h causing DISCRETE_LOGIC_INVERT not to work. Substitutes the _HUGE macro with the standard DBL_MAX value (sound\disc_mth.c) [Andrea Mazzoleni].

-  7th November  2000: Keith Wilkins sent in a preliminary version of discrete sound system emulation, not supporting any game yet.
- 20th November  1998: Zaxxon uses discrete sound circuitry that cannot be emulated. I got lucky and found some sound boards that still had some power in them. Most Zaxxon boards the capacitors are all dried up so a lot of the sound disappear. Stuff to do: Zaxxon has 5 flight sound variations.
- 0.34b4             : Removed sndhrdw\rcfilter.c.
- 0.34b3             : Added sndhrdw\rcfilter.c.
- 0.30               : 8039 emulator, and _emulated_ sound in Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Mario Bros. Since the boards also use discrete circuits to generate sound, some samples are still needed to get complete sound support. Also partial sound in Radarscope [Ron Fries, Dan Boris, Mirko Buffoni].

S1.7   Samples

- 0.168              : Fixed error in sample device [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.155              : Converted samples_device to use inline config and delegates [Osso].
- 0.153              : Fixed listsamples and one other potential problematic place [Miodrag Milanovic]. Added a missing warning to sample loading code [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.148u4            : Samples change to find in constructor (drivers\8080bw.c, aristmk4.c, astinvad.c, astrof.c, circus.c, cosmic.c, gotya.c, m10.c, m63.c, rallyx.c, safarir.c, tmnt.c, includes\mw8080bw.h and machine\mw8080bw.c). "samples" lookup tag removal (audio\blockade.c, gorf.c, meadows.c, polyplay.c, segag80r.c, segag80v.c, spacefb.c, suna8.c, turbo.c, zaxxon.c, drivers\astrocde.c, dai3wksi.c, equites.c, mcr.c, superqix.c, tankbatt.c, thief.c, tnzs.c, triplhnt.c, includes\galaga.h, machine\gaplus.c, xevious.c, video\starcrus.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.148              : Adapted error messages from lib\util\chdcd.c for emu\sound\samples.c [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.145u2            : Aaron Giles fixed 8-bit sample reading was broken. This fixed certain games with the new SAMPLE coding do not load and cause a crash in MAME. Expose a static interface for using the sample loader, for any other sound chips which may need to fetch samples.
- 0.145u1            : Rewrote SAMPLES as a modern device [Aaron Giles]. Updated all callers. FLAC reading is now done using the FLAC wrapper. There is now a samples_iterator class to centralize the logic for handling the sample list walking. Also redid the cheesy half-baked votrax device since it relied on some old samples-based handling. Until we have a real implementation, it would be good to route the various clients through the current one to at least wire it up properly, even if it just plays samples in the end. Will look into that shortly.
- 0.145              : Various wav/flac sample changes [David Haywood]: Remove hardcoded ".wav" sample extensions from within drivers. Update samples.c to check for both .flac and .wav extensions when loading a sample. Made sample loading failure a bit more verbose (various zips contained 0 byte samples, I assume to keep clrmame happy or something). Fixed memory allocation with 8-bit flac samples. WAV is not (yet) deprecated, rm warning that made it sound like it is [hap]. David Haywood fixed -verifysamples.
- 0.141u1            : Added emu\imagedev\wavfile.c/h.
- 0.133u2            : Tafoid added GAME_IMPERFECT_SOUND flag to all sets that use external samples which were not already flagged for sound.
- 0.128u6            : Introduced function macros for SAMPLES_START. Pushed the running_machine * passing through these functions. In other locations added "running_machine *machine = Machine" to the top of functions to isolate the dependencies [Atari Ace].
- 0.122u8            : Aaron Giles added stream_get_sample_rate(), stream_get_time(), and stream_get_sample_period(). These functions are not really tested yet -- make sure they give reasonable results when first used! Updated streams.h header to latest core style.
- 0.120u2            : Atari Ace fixed several misnamed sound samples interfaces.
- 0.111u2            : Zsolt Vasvari added support for multiple instances of the samples sound system.
- 0.108              : Aaron Giles added sample_get_base_freq() to allow for querying to the base frequency of samples.
- 0.107u3            : Aaron Giles fixed bug that caused the sound sampling code to not track changes in the refresh rate.
- 0.107u1            : Andrew Gardner removed hard core dependency on samples.
- 0.104u2            : Aaron Giles removed a ton of hacks that were checking for Machine->sample_rate==0, which is now guaranteed to never be true.
- 0.98u4             : Aaron Giles added pause/resume support for sample playback.
- 0.98u3             : Roman Scherzer fixed crash in MAME if 0-length data block was found in a WAV file.
- 0.94u2             : Aaron Giles fixed sample playback glitch.
- 0.93               : There is now a start function that allows you to create your own custom samples if you want. This allows us to replace "custom" drivers with "samples" in several cases. There is a new call sample_start_raw() which lets you play a raw sample from a pointer to INT16 data [Aaron Giles].
- 0.79u2             : Support for Tailgunner samples recorded by Zonn Moore.
-  4th January   2004: Chris Hardy added sound support to Space Firebird with samples.
- 29th October   2003: Tim Cottrill added sample support to Armor Attack and Sundance.
- 17th November  2002: Stefan Jokisch added support for sound samples in Subroc-3D.
- 0.36               : "-listsamples" and "-verifysamples" will not work correctly for some games. This is a known problem which will be fixed in future releases by getting rid of the samples altogether (replacing them with emulated sound).
- 25th September 1999: Mike Coates added samples to Space Panic.
- 21st September 1999: Zsolt Vasvari sent in a vicdual update which supports samples for Pulsar and Invinco.
-  3rd September 1999: Zsolt Vasvari sent in a nice update to the Vicdual driver, for example Depth Charge now has samples.
- 30th June      1999: Mathis Rosenhauer added samples for Rip Off and Solar Quest.
- 0.36b11            : Rewritten the sample listing routines for -listsamples, -listsamdir, -verifysamples and -listinfo [Juergen Buchmueller].
- 0.36b10            : Removed samplenames from stuct GameDriver. It is now in struct SamplesInterface, and some drivers load the samples directly without using that structure. Due to this change, -listsamples and -verifysamples, and the samples information in -listinfo, are no longer available. Actually, samples might not be working at all - I haven't tested them [Nicola Salmoria].
- 0.35b13            : Source: struct GameSample no longer has a volume field (since it is not stored in .wav files), to replace that struct Samplesinterface has an additional volume field which affects all samples played [Nicola Salmoria]. Replaced osd_adjust_sample() with osd_set_sample_freq() and osd_set_sample_volume(), and the OSD_PAN_xxx macros with MIXER_PAN_xxx.
- 0.35b11            : Aaron Giles added support for .wav samples. The custom .sam samples are no longer supported (you can use the sam2wav converter to convert them).
- 0.35b8             : Switches -noartwork and -nosamples to turn off artwork or sample loading [Valerio Verrando].
- 0.35b3             : Mike Coates support samples in Cosmic Guerilla.
- 0.34RC1            : Zsolt Vasvari support samples in Astro Fighter. The sound library took a lot of work. Two boardsets made this possible.
- 0.33b7             : Support for 16 bit samples in sndhrdw\samples.c [Peter Clare]. IMPORTANT NOTE FOR PORTERS: For consistency with the sound libraries, osd_play_sample_16() and osd_play_streamed_sample_16() now want the length in _bytes_ of the array, instead of the length in _shorts_ as it was before.
- 0.31               : Added sndhrdw\samples.c/h. Howie Cohen added support for missing samples to Donkey Kong Jr.
- 0.30               : Samples can be loaded from a common directory for variations of the same hardware. For example, all Space Invaders clones will load samples from the invaders directory [Valerio Verrando]. Nicola Salmoria removed samples field from the MachineDriver structure; added sound_prom field to the GameDriver structure.
- 0.29               : Brad Oliver and Shane Monroe supported partial sound (through samples) in Mario Bros.
- 0.27               : Al Kossow and Brad Oliver provided drivers for the Sega vector games (Eliminator, Space Fury, Star Trek, Tac-Scan, Zektor). Partial sound support (speech) is available through samples for some of them. Mike Coates added partial sound support (through samples) to the Carnival driver.
- 0.21               : Changes in COMMON.H for the sample structure. Now it has infos on replayrate, resolution and volume of the sample to be played. BE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THE NEW SET OF SAMPLES, OR THE "MAMESAM" CONVERTER OR YOU WILL GET NO SOUND FOR SAMPLE BASED GAMES!!
- 0.20               : Ron Fries created a new set of Donkey Kong samples, using Mike Cuddy's 8039 emulator.
- 0.18               : Samples are now loaded by the main engine, not the single drivers [Nicola Salmoria]. This is done via the new field samplenames in the GameDriver structure. Samples can then be retrieved by the drivers in Machine->samples.

S1.8   Custom

- 0.149u1            : Modernized Phoenix custom sound device [Osso].
- 0.129u4            : Removed sound\custom.c/h. Aaron Giles removed the custom sound device. The additional work to just make custom sound cases into full devices is minimal, so Aaron just converted them all over to be actual devices.
- 0.128u6            : Introduced function macros for CUSTOM_{START,STOP,RESET}. Pushed the running_machine * passing through these functions. In other locations added "running_machine *machine = Machine" to the top of functions to isolate the dependencies [Atari Ace].
- 0.93               : Added sound\custom.c/h. Many drivers using "custom" drivers were just using hard-coded samples and playing them with the (now-defunct) mixer. This is not "custom", it is "samples". They have been converted over to samples [Aaron Giles].
- SOURCE: sound\custom.cpp

-  1st November  2003: R. Belmont fixed the ADPCM functions so that games can have both MSM6295 sound chips and plain ADPCM at the same time, and he added complete sound emulation to Grand Cross Pinball.
- 31st October   2003: R. Belmont allow a driver to use both MSM6295s and "raw" ADPCM voices (gcpinbal). Also added some error trapping for MAME_DEBUG builds.
- 30th October   2003: R. Belmont added ADPCM sounds to Cabal and Dead Angle / Gang Hunter, with thanks to Jarek Burczynski for decrypting the sample ROMs.
-  2nd April     2001: Jarek Burczynski added state saving support to ADPCM and OKIM6295 sound emulation cores.

-  1st June      1999: Tatsuyuki Satoh fixed the ADPCM hack in Gladiator driver. Nicola worked on the Great Swordsman ADPCM sound.
- 31st May       1999: Aaron Giles sent in an update to the ADPCM core, to support better the newer Atari games.
- 30th April     1999: Phil Stroffolino sent in updates to many things: the SNK drivers have mostly working ADPCM sound and Cabal bootleg has ADPCM sound.
- 24th April     1999: Nicola modified the ADPCM sounds of Klax to change volume as the pieces come closer.
- 0.35b11            : Bryan McPhail added ADPCM samples to Mad Gear.

- 0.24               : Added sndhrdw\adpcm.c/h. Mirko Buffoni finally fixed problems with ADPCM decoding, so now Kung Fu Master doesn't need separate samples anymore (he didn't distribute them because of copyright on sounds). The samples are now calculated during bootstrap of the game.
- GAMES: Taito - Rastan (1987), Cadash (1987), Maze of Flott (1989)



S2.    Digital Analog Converter (DAC)

- 0.182              : More DAC identification and Namco sound research (sound\dac.h, namco.cpp, drivers\byvid.cpp, galaxian.cpp, junofrst.cpp, mappy.cpp and namcos1.cpp) [AJR].
- 0.179              : DAC WIP, started documenting the DACs in use [smf]. Added devices 1-Bit DAC, 10-Bit R-2R DAC, 12-Bit R-2R DAC, 12-Bit R-2R Twos Complement DAC, 16-Bit R-2R DAC, 16-Bit R-2R Twos Complement DAC, 2-Bit R-2R DAC, 3-Bit Binary Weighted DAC, 4-Bit Binary Weighted DAC, 4-Bit R-2R DAC, 6-Bit R-2R DAC, 8-Bit Binary Weighted DAC, 8-Bit R-2R DAC, 8-Bit R-2R Twos Complement DAC, AD7521, AD7524, AD7528, AD7533, AM6012, MC1408, MC3408, MC3410 and Voltage Regulator.
- 0.146u5            : Aaron Giles converted dac.c to a modern sound device. Update all callers. It is quite clear nobody understands how the dac device works. unsigned_write8 (formerly dac_data_w) accepts a value from 0..255 and scales it to 0..32768. signed_write8 (formated dac_signed_data_w) accepts a value from 0..255 and scales it to -32767..32768. So signed/unsigned applies to the output. The input values are always full-range unsigned data. Same goes for 16-bit variants.
- 0.129u5            : Nathan Woods added ATTR_NOTNULL to DAC sound calls.
- 0.104u6            : Aaron Giles added 4x oversampling support to the DAC sound system.
- 14th May       2001: Stefan Jokisch fixed the DAC sound in Atari Basketball.

-  7th October   1999: Tatsuyuki Satoh added DAC sounds to Namco System 1 driver.
-  1st October   1999: Aaron Giles added 16-bit interfaces to the DAC routines.
- 29th August    1999: Phil Stroffolino hooked up DACs properly in Samurai (Taito) and added the missing ROM.
- 11th June      1999: Paul Leaman and Nicola added one of the DACs to the Leland driver.
- 30th April     1999: Chris Hardy added the DAC sound to Megazone.
- 0.31               : Tatsuyuki Satoh improved YM2203 and YM2151 emulator, and DAC interface, with 16 bit samples support (use -sb 16 to turn on 16 bit samples).
- 0.30               : Added sndhrdw\dac.c/h. Source: Tatsuyuki Satoh centralized dac.c for dac sound emulation. Several drivers use it.
- 0.29               : Nicola Salmoria add digital audio (DAC) in the Taito games (used for some sound effects, most notably Tarzan's yell in Jungle King). Also, music plays in Jungle King. All the Williams games. Samples are no longer needed and may be deleted [Steven Hugg, Mirko Buffoni, Nicola Salmoria].
- 0.28               : Fabrice Frances added *emulated* sound to Q*Bert, Reactor, Krull and Mad Planets. The samples are no longer needed and may be removed. Q*Bert Qubes would work as well, if we had the sound ROM ;-( Speech is not emulated... yet!
- GAMES: Lazer Comand (Meadows 1976), Defender (Williams 1980), The Fairyland Story (Taito 1985)

- 0.152              : Added a simple DC blocker filter to the speaker toggle device (sound\speaker.c) [R. Belmont].
- 0.149              : Modernized speaker device and added save state (sound\speaker.c/h, audio\8080bw.c, drivers\maxaflex.c, pcxt.c, photon.c and photon2.c) [Fabio Priuli].
- 0.148u5            : Changed 'Speaker' sound to 'Filtered 1-bit DAC'. Attempt at a better name for what this actually is (sound\speaker.c) [smf]. See desterth, grescue, lrescue, lrescuem, maxaflex.c, mlander, pcxt.c, photon.c, photon2.c, schasercv, spacewr3 and spcewars.
- 0.141u2            : C++-ified the sound and streams interfaces. Combined sound.c and streams.c into one file, and separated the speaker device into its own file. Generalized the concept of dynamically assigned inputs and re-wired the speaker to work this way, so it is now treated just like any other sound device. Added methods to the device_sound_interface for controlling output gain and mapping device inputs/outputs to stream inputs/outputs. Also made the sound_stream_update() method pure virtual, so all modern sound devices must use the new mechanism for stream updates [Aaron Giles].
- 0.135u2            : Curt Coder actually use the speaker interface if provided.
- 0.108u4            : Added sound\speaker.c/h.

S3.1   SN76477

- 0.186              : Changed name 'SN76477' to 'TI SN76477 CSG'. Unconnected SN76477 resistor treated as invalid even though it's the initial value [Robbbert].
-  1st May       2017: Roman - Reverse engineering the 76477 "Space Invaders" sound effect chip from die photos (see http://www.righto.com/2017/04/reverse-engineering-76477-space.html).
- 0.169              : Notes, typo and RES_INF for default open circuit [Vas Crabb].
- 0.156              : Converted SN76477 to use inline config [Fabio Priuli].
- 0.152              : Modernized the SN76477 sound device (sound\sn76477.c, drivers\8080bw.c, astrof.c, crbaloon.c, dai3wksi.c, laserbat.c, rotaryf.c, route16.c, snk6502.c, spectra.c, toratora.c, audio\mw8080bw.c and n8080.c) [Osso].
- 0.144u4            : Improved SN76477 interface [Curt Coder].
- 0.112u4            : Added SN76477 noise RNG (random number generator) polynomial [Zsolt Vasvari, Derrick Renaud, Jarek Burczynski].
- 0.111u6            : Zsolt Vasvari and Derrick Renaud rewrote the SN76477 emulator from scratch. The main difference between the old one and the new one is that it is based on measurements from a real chip. Also the emulator is fully analog, meaning that timings/frequencies, etc. are based on voltage levels. This gives a much more true-to-life emulation where the weird behavior of the real chip comes emulated for free. The code itself is also a lot simpler and more understandable.
- 0.111u3            : Zsolt Vasvari added the remaining input pins to the SN76477 Interface. If these pins are constant, they can now be defined in the structure as opposed to having to call functions in an init routine. Modified all the drivers that use a 76477.
- 0.104u4            : Adam Bousley added save state support to the SN76477 sound chip.
- 0.94u2             : Derrick Renaud fixed SN76477 emulation bug where gain was 3x more then it should be, causing effects to clip for 2/3rds of the time. Fixed the SN76477 attack time for one-shot envelope mode.
-  8th April     2000: Zsolt Vasvari fixed a bug in the SN76477 emulator and got the explosion sound working in Space Chaser.
-  5th April     2000: Zsolt Vasvari added cocktail mode support and some SN76477 sound support to Space Chaser.

S3.2   SN76489

- 0.166              : Fixed PSG chips to have volume reg inited on reset to 0x0 based on tests by ValleyBell. Made Sega PSG chips start up with register 0x3 selected (volume for channel 2) based on hardware tests by Nemesis [Lord Nightmare, ValleyBell, Nemesis].
- 0.163              : Removed old kludge (sound\sn76496.c) [hap].
- 0.147              : Continuing new device implementation for SN76489 and clones (drivers\goldstar.c, guab.c, lasso.c, mrjong.c, qix.c, sbasketb.c, sbugger.c, sg1000a.c and sprcros2.c) [Osso, David Haywood]. (MESS) Converted mess\drivers\crvision.c to use new sn76494_device [Curt Coder].
- 0.146u2            : Modern class implementation to SN76489, appended to legacy code [Michael Zapf].
- 0.136u4            : Fixed TI PSG (SN76489 and friends) noise and square-wave period to be maximum length when period register is set to 0. Fixed white-noise phase/XOR issue: got rid of noise XOR/XNOR select, as all chips seem to use XOR [Lord Nightmare, Michael Zapf, PlgDavid]. Minor fix to SN76489: SN76489 wasn't using the correct noise taps (now matches SN94624, still need to test a real chip). Removed a piece of useless code, and fixed a comment [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.136u1            : Lord Nightmare, Kold666 and PlgDavid fixed period for both SN76489 and SN76489A periodic noise; fixes pitch in 'smooth criminal' demo for colecovision and fixes pitch (but not the waveform, which will require more work) of music in Do! Run Run. More work is required before the code will be bit accurate due to the way the real LFSR and periodic generator work.
- 0.135u4            : Lord Nightmare and DFJustin fixed Megadrive emulation to use the SMSIII version of the SN76489 sound chip.
- 0.135u1            : Lord Nightmare and plgDavid (David Viens) updated SN76489/A to have correct PRNG waveforms (a 0 bit was missing at the beginning, and beginning of SN76489 waveform was all 1s instead of 0s as measured on hardware). Added SN94624 (same as SN76489). Lord Nightmare trashed the old pre-accurate-clocking STEP based sample averaging scheme from SN76489 and friends, vastly simplifying the code. Made the output bipolar rather than only above the 0 line. Added missing statement to the get_safe_token function for the recently added SN94624.
- 0.116u2            : Justin Kerk and Lord Nightmare updated a number of games to correctly use the SN76489 instead of the SN76496, which was a later design.
- 0.115u4            : Lord Nightmare fixed a number of games to explicitly use the SN76489 now that it behaves differently from the SN76496.
- 0.114u3            : Improved noise emulation in the SN76496 emulator. Added several variants which differ based on the noise generator and other parameters [Lord Nightmare].
- 21st March     2002: Olivier Galibert found the correct shift register operations for noise generators for both SN76489 and YM3812.
- GAMES: Chameleon (Jaleco 1983), Van-Van Car (1983), Time Pilot'84 (Konami 1984), Finalizer (Konami 1985), Super Cross 2 (1986)
- NOTES: The SN76489 noise generator uses a 15-bit shift register with taps on bits D and E, output on /E. It uses a 15-bit ring buffer for periodic noise/arbitrary duty cycle.

S3.21  SN76489A

- 0.147              : Continuing new device implementation for SN76489A and clones (drivers\finalizr.c, gberet.c, homedata.c, shaolins.c, system1.c and yiear.c) [Osso, David Haywood].
- 0.136u4            : Fixed TI PSG (SN76489 and friends) noise and square-wave period to be maximum length when period register is set to 0. Fixed white-noise phase/XOR issue: got rid of noise XOR/XNOR select, as all chips seem to use XOR [Lord Nightmare, Michael Zapf, PlgDavid].
- 0.136u2            : Lord Nightmare, PlgDavid and Kold666 fixed SN76489a periodic noise once again (and simplified a bit of code), now should be closer to or match real chips as sampled. Added true clock divider emulation, so emulation may be a bit slower.
- 0.136u1            : Lord Nightmare, Kold666 and PlgDavid fixed period for both SN76489 and SN76489A periodic noise; fixes pitch in 'smooth criminal' demo for colecovision and fixes pitch (but not the waveform, which will require more work) of music in Do! Run Run. More work is required before the code will be bit accurate due to the way the real LFSR and periodic generator work.
- 0.114u3            : Improved noise emulation in the SN76496 emulator. Added several variants which differ based on the noise generator and other parameters [Lord Nightmare].
- NOTES: The SN76489A noise generator uses a 16-bit shift register with taps on bits D and F, output on F. It uses a 16-bit ring buffer for periodic noise/arbitrary duty cycle.

S3.22  Sega VDP PSG

- 0.186              : Changed name 'SEGA VDP PSG' to 'Sega VDP PSG'.
- 0.142u5            : Changed name 'SMSIII PSG' to 'SEGA VDP PSG'. Lord Nightmare changed name of SN76489 variant used in Sega Master System and Megadrive/Genesis from SMSIII to the more technically accurate SEGAPSG, as the PSG in question was not only used on the mark 3 units. Switch SEGA System E to use the SEGAPSG SN764xx variant, as it uses two SEGA 315-5124 VDPs which have the SEGAPSG integrated. Should slightly improve sound.
- 0.135u4            : Lord Nightmare and DFJustin fixed megadrive emulation to use the SMSIII version of the SN76489 sound chip.

- 0.147              : Continuing new device implementation for SN76496 and clones (drivers\circusc.c, galaxold.c, hyperspt.c, pacman.c, pingpong.c, retofinv.c, segag80r.c, senjyo.c, strnskil.c, superdq.c, suprloco.c, trackfld.c, xyonix.c and zaxxon.c) [Osso, David Haywood].
- 0.146u5            : Updated some drivers to use the new SN76496 device implementation. Update: Reverted original SN76496N patch and applied newer patch containing a change to 'SN76496_NEW' to avoid confusion [Osso].
- 0.135u1            : Lord Nightmare and Justin Kerk got rid of SN76496's R->OldNoise since it causes problems for gamegear/sms. Changed noise taps accordingly. Redid change to gamegear/sms for XOR vs XNOR, now verified by Justin Kerk. Verified gamegear noise taps thanks to sample provided by Justin Kerk. Add stereo sound support to sn76496.c for gamegear. Lord Nightmare added NCR7496 variant to sn76496.c. Updated comments to show which chips are currently verified. Cleaned up comments.
- 0.131u1            : Lord Nightmare added READY line readback to the SN76496 core, cleaned up the structs a bit, cleaned up comments, added more TODOs and fixed some unsaved savestate related stuff. Angelo Salese added SN76496 ready line hook-up for spcforce.c, doesn't make a difference since it's not actually used.
- 0.125u5            : Additional documentation in the SN76496 core [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.114u3            : Improved noise emulation in the SN76496 emulator. Added several variants which differ based on the noise generator and other parameters [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.104u8            : Chris Law and Aaron Giles fixed second SN76496 on Congo Bongo to have the correct frequency.
- 0.104u4            : Adam Bousley added save states to the SN76496 sound chip for Sega System 1 games.
- 0.103u4            : Aaron Giles added stream_set_sample_rate() call and converted the SN76496 sound core to output at their native sample rates, allowing the core sound system to perform over/re-sampling to the output rate.
- 0.95u2             : Sebastien Chevalier updated the SN76496 Write functions (according to the SN76489 document found on SMSPower).
- 0.36b15            : Removed sound\sn76496u.c.
- 0.34b4             : Added sndhrdw\sn76496u.c.
- 0.34b3             : Rewritten the SN76496 emulator [Nicola Salmoria]. This fixes speech in Choplifter.
- 0.31               : SN76496 support 16 bit samples as well [Tatsuyuki Satoh]. Nicola Salmoria fixed sound in Exed Exes; it has one 8910 and two 76496, not two 8910.
- 0.30               : Tatsuyuki Satoh and Nicola Salmoria cleaned up the SN76496 emulation, now it is similar to the 8910 one and all games use Tatsuyuki's code. This affects several games, most notably the Mr. Do! series.
- 0.27               : Changes in SN76496 emulation (added SN76496UpdateB function to emulate 2 chips on 8 channel PCM sound cards) [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- 0.18               : Added sndhrdw\sn76496.c/h. Nicola Salmoria finally added some lousy, very inaccurate, noise to the 76496 emulator. This affects Lady Bug and Green Beret.
- NOTES: The SN76494 and SN76496 noise generator are probably identical in operation to the SN76489A. They have an audio input line which is mixed with the 4 channels of output.

S4.2   POKEY

- 0.186              : Changed name 'POKEY' to 'Atari C012294 POKEY'.
- 0.158              : Fixed (MESS) Acid5200 pokey_default test. Make Acid5200 pokey_seroc test pass (http://www.virtualdub.org/altirra.html) [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.156              : Updated Pokey to use delegates for its callbacks. Fixed Pokey mapping in the (MESS) Atari 7800 carts [Fabio Priuli].
- 0.154              : Converted pokey_device to DEVCB2 [Osso].
- 0.148u4            : Correct bit for POK_KEY_BREAK which now allows colon/semi-colon [:;] key to work properly (atari_a800_keyboard: machine\atari.c) [Tom Clayton].
- 0.148u2            : Fixed uninitialized variables in sound\pokey.c [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.147u1            : Moved handling of quad Pokey into drivers as asked (drivers\irobot.c, mhavoc.c and starwars.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.146u2            : Comment out error.log flooder [hap].
- 0.146u1            : Couriersud added device_execute_interface to POKEY and moved interrupt handling into the clock stepping routine. Nice step forward. The code is now a lot easier to understand and interrupts and sound generation are no longer disjunct. Added cycle exact potentiometer and keyboard support to Pokey device. The keyboard changes may break some MESS drivers. Please have a look at atari.c and bartop52.c for an example how the new implementation works. Fixed compile error and added preliminary debugger state support. Cool, really cool, and all the devices_interfaces work. "Analog" Pokey Update [Couriersud]: Derived internal resistance calculation from Pokey documentation. This is a 4-bit parallel resistor (High-Z mos "devices") network to ground. The result is a non-linear resistance function. Added low-pass filter support and opamp/resistor stages to the Pokey driver. This is not as good as complete discrete emulation, but a lot better than the linear approximation we had before. Changed a couple of drivers to use the new output volume calculation. Added device configuration macros. Made all drivers use them. Added POKEY filter stages to a couple of more games. Note: Most Atari games have additional filters. At some stage, discrete processing needs to be added. The Quad Pokey needs to become a device to properly and efficiently emulate outputs being tied together. This will trigger some changes to the Pokey device, namely the introduction of a base device. Added POKEY filter stage to Tunnel Hunt. Removed class members no longer needed from POKEY. hap fixed Couriersud's pokepokeyproblem.
- 0.146              : Couriersud improved sound emulation for POKEY chip. Changed audio emulation to emulate borrow 3 clock delay and proper channel reset. New frequency only becomes effective after the counter hits 0. Emulation also treats counters as 8 bit counters which are linked now instead of monolytic 16 bit counters. Fixed high pass filters for POKEY. Added POKEYN device based on modern device. Fixed random lfsr generation. Consolidated polynom code. Removed legacy left overs from Pokey code. Added a internal pokey_channel class. This fixed Liberator resets on the planet screen if any wave above 16 (19 or 22) was selected and imperfect sound play in Missile Command for UFO and bomber attack. Convert all remaining drivers to use the modern Pokey device. Fixed debug build for pokey.c. Fixed no sound in debug build. First try at adding a device_execute_interface to pokeyn_device. This looks promising. Currently commented out. If this works, this will significantly simplify the driver and make most timers in pokey.c disappear.
- 0.145u8            : Various Clang warning cleanups in sound\pokey.c [Balrog].
- 0.104u2            : Aaron Giles added save state support to the POKEY emulator.
- 0.103u4            : Aaron Giles added stream_set_sample_rate() call and converted the POKEY sound core to output at their native sample rates, allowing the core sound system to perform over/re-sampling to the output rate.
- 0.93               : Changed name 'Pokey' to 'POKEY'.
- 0.89u3             : Juergen Buchmueller attempted to make Pokey random number generator work better with recordings (not verified to improve things yet).
- 0.84u5             : MikeJ fixed subtle behavior in the ALLPOT handlers for the POKEY when held in reset.
- 0.37b7             : Juergen Buchmueller fixed the Pokey emulation so that the Tempest reset bug is fixed, this time for real and forever.
- 28th August    2000: Juergen Buchmueller modified the Pokey RNG functions to finally work as they would in real hardware.
- 25th June      2000: Juergen Buchmueller fixed the Pokey sound core, and Tempest sounds a bit better now.
- 0.36RC1            : Rewritten the Pokey emulator for greater accuracy [Juergen Buchmueller].
- 10th February  2000: Juergen Buchmueller fixed yet more stuff in the Pokey core.
-  5th February  2000: Juergen Buchmueller made some speedups to the Pokey core.
-  3rd February  2000: Juergen Buchmueller rewrote the Pokey code.

- 0.36b12            : The hangs in Tempest caused by the Pokey protection should now be fixed once and for all [Juergen Buchmueller].
- 0.35b2             : Zsolt Vasvari added Centipede (bootleg with AY8910 instead of Pokey).
- 0.34b8             : Removed sndhrdw\pokyintf.c/h. Juergen Buchmueller improved the Pokey emulation.
- 0.30               : Removed sndhrdw\8910intf.c. Aaron Giles changed the way POKEY sound/interface is updated: There's no longer a fixed "updates per frame" value defined in the driver, instead the audio is stream is generated whenever a chip register is written to (and at every vblank). This improves sound quality in several games.
- 0.29               : Brad Oliver updated pokyintf.c to be more like 8910intf.c. Variable clock frequency, port callbacks, a clipping parameter, variable updates per frame. Most noticeably, Tempest has much improved sound with more frequent updates.
- 0.27               : Added sndhrdw\pokyintf.c/h. Thanks to the precious information on the Pokey random number generator provided by Eric Smith, Hedley Rainnie and Sean Trowbridge, some problems with Centipede (start with 18 credits) and Tempest (hang after level 13) are now solved. Brad Oliver wrote the new sndhrdw\pokyintf.c file. It handles most of the Pokey interface to pokey.c. Rather than call milliped_sh_start() or whatever, call pokeyx_sh_start(), where x is the number of pokeys. It will keep track of the Pokey count and use the appropriate clipping. I'm not sure 3 pokeys is a possible combination so there is no such pokey3_sh_start() routine.
- 0.16               : Added sndhrdw\8910intf.c/h. Brad Oliver modified pokey.c and pokey.h to make them more portable.
- 0.14               : Ron Fries provided a new version of his Pokey emulator which fixes problems in the interface with the SEAL audio library (signed vs. unsigned samples).
- 0.12               : Added sndhrdw\pokey.c/h and pokey.txt. POKEY emulator by Ron Fries. Sound in Centipede, through Ron Fries' POKEY emulator. The biggest difference between the emulator and the original hardware is that the emulator emulates an 'ideal' POKEY chip. All output from the emulator is a based on a precise square wave, whereas the output from the original chip has decay. Though the output is slightly different, I don't believe this difference is easily discernible. Another slight difference is the 17-bit/9-bit poly. Since the polynomial is large (2^17 bits), I choose to create the sample using a random number generator rather than a table. I don't believe this difference is significant. There are also a few differences which are introduced by aliasing. This is a direct result of using an output sampling rate which is not identical to the original sound rate. It is most evident with high frequencies. A final difference is the lack of support for the High-Pass Filter functionality. I plan to add this in a future release if necessary.
- NOTES: Based on original info found in Ron Fries' Pokey emulator, with additions by Brad Oliver, Eric Smith and Juergen Buchmueller, paddle (a/d conversion) details from the Atari 400/800 Hardware Manual. Polynome algorithms according to info supplied by Perry McFarlane.
- POKEY chip emulator
  rev 4.5: Changed the 9/17 bit polynomial formulas such that the values required for the Tempest Pokey protection will be found. Tempest expects the upper 4 bits of the RNG to appear in the lower 4 bits after four cycles, so there has to be a shift of 1 per cycle (which was not the case before). Bits #6-#13 of the new RNG give this expected result now, bits #0-7 of the 9 bit poly. Reading the RNG returns the shift register contents ^ 0xff. That way resetting the Pokey with SKCTL (which resets the polynome shifters to 0) returns the expected 0xff value.
      4.4: Reversed sample values to make OFF channels produce a zero signal. Actually de-reversed them; don't remember that I reversed them.
      4.3: For POT inputs returning zero, immediately assert the ALLPOT bit after POTGO is written, otherwise start trigger timer depending on SK_PADDLE mode, either 1-228 scanlines or 1-2 scanlines, depending on the SK_PADDLE bit of SKCTL.
      4.2: Half volume for channels which are inaudible (this should be close to the real thing).
      4.1: Default gain increased to closely match the old code. Random numbers repeat rate depends on POLY9 flag too! Verified sound output with many, many Atari 800 games, including the SUPPRESS_INAUDIBLE optimizations.
      4.0: MAME - Rewritten from scratch. 16bit stream interface. Serout ready/complete delayed interrupts. Reworked pot analog/digital conversion timing. Optional non-indexing Pokey update functions.
      2.0: (31st Jan 1997 - Ron Fries) Support for multiple POKEY chips. The maximum supported is configured at compile time. An adjustable gain. The previous releases had a built-in gain of 64. A clipping option. Depending on the number of chips emulated and the configured gain, it is possible for the output to exceed 8-bits. Clipping can be enabled to prevent this, though it does increase the processing time.

S4.3   Atari Audio Board II

- 0.172              : SOUNDCPU rom loading cleanups in various Atari drivers [Osso].
- 0.149u1            : Convert Atari JSA sound boards to their own devices, and replumb them through the Atari games that used them (drivers\atarig1.c, atarig42.c, atarigx2.c, batman.c, beathead.c, blstroid.c, cyberbal.c, eprom.c, harddriv.c, offtwall.c, skullxbo.c, thunderj.c, toobin.c, vindictr.c and xybots.c). Move Atari drivers to using ioport callbacks for sound communication stuff. Added HBLANK to standard screen ports. Consolidated duplicate functions [Aaron Giles].
- 0.137u3            : Lord Nightmare further refining of the Atari JSA speech and audio modifications. Hooked up the reset line for the YM2151. Partly implemented 'stereo' gating (using YM2151 ctX lines) to POKEY and TMS5220 on Atari JSA-i sound board. Currently it is just 'mono' gating. Added TODOs for complete stereo gating and for the low-pass filter.
- 0.132u4            : Aaron Giles updated the atarijsa code to use a custom address space for its okim6295 accesses (which are banked on the first half and static on the second half), as an example of configuring a device with a custom address space. For now, attempts to use okim6295_set_bank_base() will still work, though banking for the okim chips should be moved to custom address maps in the drivers eventually. The first time okim6295_set_bank_base() is called, it will install a banked memory handler over the region and use memory_set_bankptr() to change the base on subsequent bank switches.
- 0.131u2            : Phil Bennett fixed incorrectly pitched audio samples in games using atarijsa.c.
- 0.114              : Couriersud added general save state support to the atarijsa and atarigen modules.

- 0.141u3            : Added specific support for the fact that setting frequency to 0 does not behave as if frequency was set to 0x400 on the Sega-manufactured PSG clone chips, whereas it does on the original TI-made ones. Fixes Sega Master System 'Vigilante' music [Lord Nightmare, Enik].
- 0.140u3            : Atari Ace removed static variables in FM sound cores.
- 0.126u5            : More FM OPN fixes [Eke, R. Belmont]: Pass chip type around and restore Jarek's original behavior for YM2203/YM2610. Always recalculate attack rate in set_ar_ksr, fixes Megadrive/Genesis "Batman & Robin".
- 0.126u4            : Backported a bunch of FM OPN (YM2608/2612) fixes from Genesis Plus GX. All of this was verified on real hardware [Eke-Eke, Nemesis, Alone Coder, AamirM]: Implemented PG overflow, aka "detune bug" (Ariel, Comix Zone, Shaq Fu, Spiderman...). Fixed SSG-EG support. Modified EG rates and frequency. Fixed EG attenuation level on KEY ON (Ecco 2 splash sound). Fixed LFO phase update for CH3 special mode (Warlock, Alladin).

- 0.99u8             : Fixed pointer of FM channels and FM basic status.
- 0.99u7             : Aaron Giles removed gross cur_chip hack from the OPN emulator.
- 0.76u2             : Fixes to the ymdeltat module. Generally - even more flags work correctly now. These changes are necessary for the MSX sound emulation (Y8950) and were tested in nlmsx emulator by Frits Hilderink [Jarek Burczynski].
-  3rd August    2003: Jarek Burczynski fixed YM2608 initial values (after the reset), fixed flag and irqmask handling (YM2608) and fixed BUFRDY flag handling (YM2608).

Changed YMxxxUpdateOne() functions (YM2203, YM2608, YM2610, YM2610B, YM2612), this was needed to calculate YM2610 FM channels output correctly. (Each FM channel is calculated as in other chips, but the output of the channel gets shifted right by one *before* sending to accumulator. That was impossible to do with previous implementation).
- 23rd July      2001: Jarek Burczynski and Nicola Salmoria corrected YM2610 ADPCM type A algorithm and tables (verified on real chip).
- 11th June      2001: Jarek Burczynski corrected end of sample bug in ADPCMA_calc_cha(). Real YM2610 checks for equality between current and end addresses (only 20 LSB bits).

- 31st May       2001: Tatsuyuki Satoh added state saving support to the FM sound core.
- 24th May       2001: Jarek Burczynski re-submitted an update to the FM sound core.
- 0.36b13            : Removed sound\fmext.c.
- 0.36b7             : Several improvements to FM sound emulators. This also fixes crashes in some Jaleco Mega System 1 games [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
-  4th October   1999: Tatsuyuki Satoh sent in an update to his FM core with still incomplete LFO support (intro of Rock 'n Rage needs this) and some other bugfixes.
- 0.36b1             : Added sound\fmopl.c/h.

-  9th December  1998: Hiro-shi changed ADPCM volume (8->16, 48->64), replaced ym2610 ch0/3 (YM-2610B), init cur_chip (restart bug fix), changed ADPCM_SHIFT (10->8) missing bank change 0x4000-0xffff, added ADPCM_SHIFT_MASK and changed ADPCMA_DECODE_MIN/MAX.
-  8th December  1998: Hiro-shi renamed ADPCMA -> ADPCMB, ADPCMB -> ADPCMA, moved ROM limit check.(CALC_CH? -> 2610Write1/2), tested program (ADPCMB_TEST), moved ADPCM A/B end check, ADPCMB repeat flag(no check), changed ADPCM volume rate (8->16) (32->48).
- 0.34b6             : [DOS] Nicola replaced the -fm option with -ym2203opl. Added -noym3812opl to use the digital emulation of the YM3812 instead of the SoundBlaster OPL chip. Note that with -noym3812opl you also need external drum samples. FULL sound support in the NeoGeo games, FM synth and ADPCM samples, on 90% of games using the YM2610 emulator.
- 0.34b2             : Added sndhrdw\fmext.c. Tatsuyuki Satoh updated the FM emulation and the way the 8910 updates its buffers. FM also has support for YM2608 and YM2612, though they are not compiled in.
- 0.30               : Added sndhrdw\fm.c/h. YM2203 emulation not using the SoundBlaster OPL3 chip. This is more accurate than the previous one, which used the SoundBlaster OPL chip, however it is also slower. You can still revert to the old behaviour using the -fm command line option [Tatsuyuki Satoh]. Nicola Salmoria added partial emulated sound in Bubble Bobble (only the YM2203 chip, therefore only some sound effects - no music).
- 0.23               : "And there was MUSIC!" [Mirko Buffoni]. Thanks to Ishmair's YM-2203 FM engine, music is supported in Commando, Ghosts 'n Goblins, Diamonds. Since the synthesis is based on FM generation via OPL, you must have a SoundBlaster, Adlib, or compatible to get the music. However I heavily dislike this approach and I'm looking for documentation on FM generation. If anyone want to join to the party forward me a mail!
- 0.22               : Nicola added COMMANDO. Original Sound is done by YM2203 (FM synthesis) while now is done by 8910 (no FM). So music is not present.
- GAMES: sound\2203intf.cpp, 2608intf.cpp, 2610intf.cpp, 2612intf.cpp, 3526intf.cpp, 3812intf.cpp and 8950intf.cpp

- 0.147u2            : Rewrote the YM2151 interface to be fully modernized, and removed the ym2151_interface struct in favor of inline configs using the new DEVCB2 mechanism. In many cases, removed no longer needed trampolines, instead taking advantage of direct support for input line writes [Aaron Giles].
- 0.145u7            : Added device_t::subbank("tag") to return a bank that is owned by the given device. Switched YM2151 interfaces over to DEVCB callbacks.

Only one of the two YM2151 emulators is linked, this is determined at compile time. The default is Jarek's, which is more accurate though a little slower. It can be replaced with Tatsuyuki's changing the makefile.
- 0.36b12            : Tatsuyuki Satoh fixed OPN and OPM output level. Unfortunately this means that all games using YM2203, YM2151 etc. need to be rebalanced.
-  6th December  1999: Jarek Burczynski rebalanced the YM2151 core.
- 14th November  1999: Tatsuyuki Satoh fixed LFO in YM-2151.
-  5th November  1999: Jarek Burczynski fixed a small bug in YM2151.
- 24th October   1999: Bryan McPhail added an original Tumblepop romset (with correct YM2151 sounds) to the driver.
- 0.36b7             : Aaron Giles fixed YM2151 sound board support for Joust 2. Improvements to the YM2151 emulator [Jarek Burczynski].
- 0.35b12            : Major improvements to Atari sound (e.g. speech in Toobin') [Aaron Giles].
- 12th February  1999: Nicola added YM2151 support for Street Fighter 1, but samples are still missing.
- 0.34b8             : Support for stereo output. This is implelemented in the YM2610 and in Tatsuyuki's YM2151. It can be used by other games, for example the Atari System 2 games (Paper Boy etc.) have two Pokeys, one per channel [Nicola Salmoria]. DOS: Stereo sound support. It is a little slower than mono, to turn it off use -nostereo. Stereo is enabled only for YM2610 and YM2151 games. The others always use mono.
- 0.31               : Added sndhrdw\ym2151.c/h. New YM2151 emulator, used by Rastan and others [Jarek Burczynski]. Tatsuyuki Satoh improved YM2203 and YM2151 emulator, and DAC interface, with 16 bit samples support (Use -sb 16 to turn on 16 bit samples).
- 0.30               : Added sndhrdw\2151intf.c/h. YM2151 emulation [Tatsuyuki Satoh].

- 0.93               : The YM2203/2608/2610 chips now pass a set of functions into the FM core with pointers to all the AY8910-compatibility routines, rather than relying on global pointers [Aaron Giles].
-  8th May       2003: Jarek Burczynski fixed a bug in the YM2203 core that caused a stuck tone in Desert Assault.
- 12th December  2002: Jarek Burczynski sent in an update to the FM sound chip emulators with support for YM2608 drums, perfect envelope generator in YM2203, YM2610, YM2608 and YM2612 and other small fixes.

- 0.57               : Jarek Burczynski did SSG EG type support added to YM2203 emulation (which is now complete). This fixes hbarrel wave sound on start of level 1, and some sound effects in other games (e.g. Dark Seal).
- 21st December  2001: Jarek Burczynski added SSG EG type support to the YM2203 emulation, which fixes sounds in Heavy Barrel and Dark Seal.
- 30th November  2001: Aaron Giles improved the handling of AY8910 and YM2203 simultaneously.
- 0.55               : Changed name 'YM-2203' to 'YM2203'. Tatsuyuki Satoh added support for using AY8910 and YM2203 at the same time, fixing sound in City Connection.
- 28th May       2001: Tatsuyuki Satoh fixed the bad sound frequency in games which use the Yamaha sound chips.
- 26th February  2001: Tatsuyuki Satoh sent in an update to the YM-2203 emulator, correcting a few parameters.
- 13th December  2000: Jarek Burczynski fixed YM2203 frequency calculation and added sound to Drive Out.
- 0.36b15            : Source: Added gain support to mixer.c, through the new MIXERG() macro (extension of MIXER()). Removed the gain filed from AY8910, YM2203, YM2610 structures.
- 0.36b12            : Tatsuyuki Satoh fixed OPN and OPM output level. Unfortunately this means that all games using YM2203, YM2151 etc. need to be rebalanced.
- 17th June      1999: Brad Oliver fixed YM2203 core to be multi-session friendly.
- 0.35b11            : Added sound\2203intf.h. Removed sound\psgintf.h.
- 0.35b9             : Removed sndhrdw\2203intf.h.
- 0.35b6             : Removed sndhrdw\psgintf.c.
- 0.35b5             : Added sndhrdw\2203intf.c.

- 0.35b1             : Partial sound in The Real Ghostbusters. The YM2203 doesn't seem to work correctly [Nicola Salmoria].
- 0.34b6             : [DOS] Nicola replaced the -fm option with -ym2203opl. Added -noym3812opl to use the digital emulation of the YM3812 instead of the SoundBlaster OPL chip. Note that with -noym3812opl you also need external drum samples.
- 0.31               : Tatsuyuki Satoh improved YM2203 and YM2151 emulator, and DAC interface, with 16 bit samples support.
- 0.30               : Added sndhrdw\2203intf.h and psgintf.c/h. Tatsuyuki Satoh added YM2203 emulation not using the SoundBlaster OPL3 chip. This is more accurate than the previous one, which used the SoundBlaster OPL chip, however it is also slower. You can still revert to the old behavior using the -fm command line option. Nicola added partial emulated sound in Bubble Bobble (only the YM2203 chip, therefore only some sound effects - no music).
- 0.25               : Moved sndhrdw\ym2203.h to msdos\.
- 0.23               : Added sndhrdw\ym2203.h. "And there was MUSIC!". Thanks to Ishmair's YM-2203 FM engine, music is supported in Commando, Ghosts 'n Goblins, Diamonds. Since the synthesis is based on FM generation via OPL, you must have a SoundBlaster, Adlib, or compatible to get the music.
- 0.22               : Nicola added COMMANDO. Original Sound is done by YM2203 (FM synthesis) while now is done by 8910 (no FM). So music is not present.
- NOTES: Yamaha FM Synthesis Sound Processor. Emulator JFF emulates the YM2203 chip via OPL3 chip (most Sound Blasters and clones are equipped with it. OPL3 can't really emulate the YM2203 chip, but by some fiddling one can get reasonable sound out of it.)

- 0.37b12            : Added sound\ym2413.h and 2413intf.c. Standalone YM2413 emulator, giving much better sound in e.g. Pang [Mitsutaka Okazaki, Sean Young].
-  1st February  2001: Sean Young integrated Mitsutaka Okazaki's YM2413 emulator (http://www.angel.ne.jp/~okazaki/ym2413/) into MAME, and all the games utilizing it sound much better now.
- 16th July      2000: Brad Oliver adapted Charles MacDonald's YM2413 emulation into MAME, though its accuracy is not yet known, so it might or might not replace the current emulation.
- 0.37b4             : Improved YM2413 emulation [Paul Leaman].
-  7th June      2000: Paul Leaman sent in a YM2413 update with proper frequency calculations.

- 0.170              : Null pointer bad (YM2608 YM_DELTAT_ADPCM_Reset; sound\fm.cpp) [Carl].
- 0.151              : Removed 8 kilobytes of internal ROM sample data from MAME's YM2608 emulation, it's been there for ~11 years. After getting legal advice over some recent happenings this was highlighted as a clear infringement of Yamaha's copyright within the MAME code, and in need of urgent addressing, distributing any builds / source trees with this present is inadvisable [David Haywood]. Un-marked the 2608 rom as bad, since AFAIK Jarek did test this dump as an external rom and it completely matched the internal rom when played back, digitally compared at the DAC input. Also re-added comments from the original fm.c version. It would be best if we can find a 2608 to decap eventually, though [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.148u5            : Modernized the YM2608 (sound\2608intf.c/h, drivers\bbusters.c, itech8.c, pipedrm.c, tail2nos.c and wc90.c). Removed fm.h and few changes for consistency (sound\2608intf.c/h). Clears variables to avoid random crashing. Removed unnecessary #includes [smf].

All of this was verified on real hardware [Eke-Eke, Nemesis, Alone Coder, AamirM]: Implemented PG overflow, aka "detune bug" (Ariel, Comix Zone, Shaq Fu, Spiderman...). Fixed SSG-EG support. Modified EG rates and frequency. Fixed EG attenuation level on KEY ON (Ecco 2 splash sound). Fixed LFO phase update for CH3 special mode (Warlock, Alladin).
- 0.94u4             : BUT fix crash games using FM sound chips when you load state (sound\2151intf.c, 2203intf.c, 2608intf.c, 2610intf.c and 2612intf.c).
- 0.93               : The YM2203/2608/2610 chips now pass a set of functions into the FM core with pointers to all the AY8910-compatibility routines, rather than relying on global pointers [Aaron Giles].
- 0.70u2             : Jarek Burczynski makes various sound improvements to YM2610, YM2608 and Y8950, inspired by Frits Hilderink (NLMSX emulator author). Inspired by Frits Hilderink (NLMSX emulator author) Jarek attempted to improve support of the ymdeltat module for the status registers (YM2610,YM2608,Y8950), implement x1bit/x8bit DRAM usage for the ADPCM samples, implement memory read/write via deltat (Y8950 and YM2608) and ADPCM synthesis in 'slave' mode (CPU controlled, instead of memory based). Made some tests but the changes are quite big so please test them before including. I'm sure the Y8950 will be tested by NLMSX authors too.
- 29th April     2003: Jarek Burczynski sent in a fix to the DELTA-T decoding in the YM2608 sound core, fixing the bad sounds in Mechanized Attack, and he fixed the LFO emulation in all of the FM chips.
- 0.63               : Jarek Burczynski added drum support in YM2608 emulation (check e.g. Tail 2 Nose).
- 12th December  2002: Jarek Burczynski sent in an update to the FM sound chip emulators with support for YM2608 drums, perfect envelope generator in YM2203, YM2610, YM2608 and YM2612 and other small fixes.
-  1st December  2002: Jarek Burczynski - Fixed register addressing in YM2608, YM2610 and YM2610B chips (verified on real YM2608). The addressing patch used for early Neo-Geo games can be removed now.
- 26th November  2002: Jarek Burczynski and Nicola Salmoria - Recreated YM2608 ADPCM ROM using data from real YM2608's output which leads to added emulation of YM2608 drums. Output of YM2608 is two times lower now, same as YM2610 (verified on real YM2608).

- 0.154              : Sync timer fixes from GenPlus-GX (sound\fm2612.c). This fixed some of the sound effects in MegaDrive are wrong compared to the console/cartridge. Several emulators do it correctly, like Kega and GenPlus-GX. GenPlus-GX source may be useful in this case, since it shares cores with MESS/MAME. This fixed also the broken SFX in Streets of Rage II (Mega Play) [Enik Land]. Sega System C2 didn't entirely like the changes, update sound\fm2612.c code [R. Belmont].
- 0.148u5            : Temporarily limit table lookup ranges (sound\fm2612.c) [R. Belmont]. Modernised YM3438 (sound\2612intf.c/h, drivers\segac2.c, segas18.c, segas32.c, seta.c, shangha3.c, includes\megadriv.h and machine\megadriv.c). Removed unnecessary #includes [smf].

-  9th April     2012: HardWareMan - YM2612 decapped (http://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=14976#14976): I've finished it. This is my first experience of gluing pictures, so do not kick me. So, this picture 24516x21770 pixels and 116MBytes. It's too big for FileDen, and all pichostings, so I placed it on filesharing service. Someone of you can rehost it to better place. 1. DAC is 8bit, not 9bit. 2. DAC seems to be one not only for 6 channels, but for left/right output too. But I don't get it: oscilloscope shows channel synchronization. Perhaps they used the capacitance to store the current signal level. DAC place at upper right corner on picture. All analog pins can easily be traced to him. The first step is to identify all the blocks in the picture. Interestingly, below the center at right side there are some matrixes, perhaps this is the operator unit and the calculation tables for the level of the envelope and sine. And they're seems 14-bit. On the left side above the middle is likely array of registers.

- 0.81u8             : Ville Linde fixed YMF271 pitch, this improves music in Brave Blade.
- 0.77u3             : Added sound\ymf271.c/h. YMF271 sound core plus very preliminary hook up in ms32.c (only Desert War makes any sound at all and it doesn't really seem to be anything like correct, this is probably due to a combination of Z80 communication and banking issues) [R. Belmont].
- 12th December  2003: R. Belmont sent in a YMF271 sound core and added it to the Jaleco Mega System 32 driver, but sound doesn't work in it yet.

- 12th December  2002: R. Belmont fixed the YMF278B sound frequency in the Psikyo SH-2 systems and fixed a bug in it that caused missing sounds in Hot Debut.
- 0.62               : Added sound\ymf278b.c/h. Preliminary YMF278B emulation (missing FM support) [R. Belmont].
-  8th September 2002: R. Belmont fixed the missing bass and drum sounds in the YMF278B sound chip emulation.
- 18th August    2002: Olivier Galibert added preliminary envelope support to the YMF278B sound chip emulation and fixed the endlessly looping sounds. Sixtoe fixed the pitch in the YMF278B core.
- 12th August    2002: Olivier Galibert fixed the sample pitch in the YMF278B emulation, but some samples are still erroneously looping over and over.
- 11th August    2002: Olivier Galibert integrated R. Belmont's YMF278B sound chip emulation (FM not emulated yet) and Paul Priest's graphics fixes to the Psikyo driver, and Strikers 1945 is now playable with sound, though the sound is not entirely correct. Sound was also added to the Psikyo SH-2 driver, and sprite zoom in Aero Fighters was fixed.
- NOTES: The Yamaha OPL4 (YMF-278B), which is an OPL3 with a very powerful PCM section added. It's nothing at all like the YMZ-280, which is a very bare-bones ADPCM chip. The Yamaha 2MB YRW801 rom has the samples for the OPL4 (YMF-278B).

S5.45  SCSP

- 0.186              : Changed name 'SCSP' to 'YMF292-F SCSP'. Fixed SCSP UNPACK sign extension (sound\scspdsp.cpp) [Vas Crabb].
- 0.170              : Make ST-V not crash. coolridr defines a region for the RAM, stv driver doesn't. Uses set_ram_base instead, which seems to be more correct anyway (sound\scsp.cpp) [David Haywood].
- 0.164              : MSLC port in SCSP writes seems to mask with 0xf800 according to Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius [Angelo Salese].
- 0.153              : Removed sound\scsplfo.c. Fixed SCSP array out of bounds access [R. Belmont]. Rewrite SCSP to modern device [Osso, Miodrag Milanovic].

- 0.148u2            : Changed a log around (sound\scsp.c). Hooked up internal SCSP DSP registers, Kyuutenkai (MESS) needs them for booting. Added snippet. Added SCSP sound clear. Added SCSP timer A irq for Main CPU, fixes a booting bug in Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius (game still not working due of timing bugs) [Angelo Salese].
- 0.148u1            : Made a more sane Sound->Main IRQ behaviour in SCSP. SCSP: Made MSLC register to be write only, fixes (MESS) Deka Yonku ~Tough the Truck~ hang on Human logo. Added SCSP DSP registers read-back, fixes booting in (MESS) Tunnel B1 / Finalist. Fixed SCIEB not updating irqs, fixes (MESS) Alien Trilogy booting [Angelo Salese].
- 0.145              : R. Belmont fixed master SCSP detection. This fixed all sets in the ST-V driver do not start or play correctly.
- 0.143u4            : Angelo Salese added MVOL to the SCSP core, used for sound fade in/out effects.
- 0.142u5            : Angelo Salese moved SCSP to main irq function into an external write line function, fixes sound regression in Groove on Fight and Intro Don Don.
- 0.137u4            : SCSP updates [PluginNinja]: Improved slot monitor function. Various cleanups.
- 0.128u6            : R. Belmont re-ordered SCSP init to fix crash.
- 0.125              : Kingshriek fixed an envelope corner case in the SCSP.
- 0.124u1            : Fixed encoding/decoding of negative denormal floats in the AICA/SCSP DSP. Shouldn't actually affect any games [kingshriek, Deunan Knute].
- 0.122u8            : Further improvements to SCSP FM [kingshriek].
- 0.122u7            : Preserve fractional part of sample offset when looping in SCSP. Fixes remaining pitch stability problems. Fixed minor issue with timers B&C expiring [kingshriek, R. Belmont].
- 0.122u6            : Kingshriek removed unnecessary check that could cause SCSP hangs in Guardian Force.
- 0.122u4            : Implemented decent-sounding FM in SCSP [kingshriek].
- 0.122              : More major SCSP fixes [kingshriek]: Rewrote much of the interpolation code. Improved key-rate scaling calculation. Fixed playback of non-looping samples with a zero loop-end address. Fixed backwards looping mode so that it initially reads forward until encountering the loop-start address. Preliminary but reasonable-sounding FM support. Fixed overflow in frequency calculation. Improved FM, but it's disabled for now because it doesn't sound right yet. Improved DSP wet/dry mix (should be correct now). Fixed a minor LPSLNK problem.
- 0.121u4            : SCSP updates [kingshriek]: Added effect-in mixer. Added DSP floating-point support. Added bounds check to the DECAY1 EG output. Fixed the saw PLFO waveform. Fixed loop points so loops no longer go out of tune/include garbage samples.
- 0.121u3            : SCSP improvements [kingshriek]: Added logarithmic envelope table. Set envelope level to start at 0x17f in the ATTACK state (0x3ff-0x280) as per Neill's notes. Changed EG_SHIFT from 8 to 16 - more precision is needed to differentiate the longer decay envelope times. In the DECAY1-->DECAY2 transition, changed the "<=" to "<". Decreased the output of the effect out mixer a bit. Fixed unaligned 16-bit samples. Prevented keyoffs from killing slots when already in the release state. Envelope steps in the attack state are apparently exponential. To account for this, I change the envelope output to linear for attacks. Change the release rate calculation to use the decay table instead of the attack one.
- 0.120u4            : SCSP fixes [kingshriek]: Fixed DECAY1 envelope state to not exit immediately. Improved support for LPSLNK and SBCTL. Fixed panning calculation bug. Fixed case where key-rate scaling is off.
- 0.120u3            : Some build-related improvements to the sound cores [Atari Ace]: The SCSP dependency on mame\drivers\saturn.c was removed allowing it to built independent of the driver.
- 0.120u1            : R. Belmont fixed a corner case in the SCSP involving timers which are polled with their IRQ enable shut off.
- 0.119u4            : More SCSP improvements [El Semi]: Fixed endianness issue on 8-bit samples and added interpolation. Disabled modulation attempt (should fix the crash problems). Tweeked pitch calculation.
- 0.119u3            : R. Belmont fixed broken SCSP from last update.
- 0.119u2            : SCSP improvements [R. Belmont, ElSemi]: Fixed issue with changing the pitch of an active voice set to backwards or bidirectional loop. Removed fake reverb. Fixed internal DSP to operate properly. Rewrote timers and interrupt handling. Fixed operation when 2 SCSPs are present.
- 25th September 2007: R. Belmont - ElSemi and I have been fixing up the SCSP emulation in MAME lately due to the emergence of .SSF (Saturn/ST-V) music rips. He's still working out why samples in Radient Silvergun get overdriven all to heck, but in the meantime I've done the following: * Fixed the effects DSP to work properly in MAME - the kick drum in Shienryu now has the proper reverb applied, and this fixes missing sounds/instruments in several ST-V games. It also fixed a Saturn Qsound demo disc that boots over in MESS. * Rewrote the timers to use MAME timers. This fixes missing sound in a few ST-V games and gives Die Hard Arcade correct tempo. It also eliminates the IRQ storms you may have seen running ST-V games with -oslog. * Fixed some IRQ trouble. This got sound working again in Model 2A games, like Dead or Alive.
- 0.119u1            : SCSP fixes [R. Belmont]: Fix writes to the hole in the SCSP address space (0x430 to 0x5ff) to not trash global registers. Fixed SCSP DMA to not read random memory for its' registers.
- 0.113u4            : R. Belmont fixed crashes in some games using the SCSP.
- 0.113u3            : David Haywood fixed crashing bugs in SCSP emulation.
- 0.112              : R. Belmont fixed SCSP DSP RAM initialization.
- 0.111u6            : Added sound\scspdsp.c/h. ElSemi added preliminary support for the built-in effects DSP in the SCSP, which lots of games use for reverb, QSound and other effects.
- 0.97u1             : Ville Linde fixed a minor bug in the SCSP timer handling.
- 0.93               : Changed name 'YMF292-F_SCSP' to 'SCSP'.
- 0.88               : Fixed undersized array causing stack trashing in YMF292-F SCSP (thanks to Mame32Plus).
- 0.81u9             : SCSP Update [ElSemi]: Fixed envelope rates to be correct. Added key rate scaling support. Added ringbuffer support.
- 0.77u3             : SCSP updates [Elsemi, R. Belmont].
-  3rd December  2003: ElSemi added support for per-voice gain parameters in the SCSP sound core, improving the sound balance.
- 0.77u2             : SCSP fixes (improves music in some games a little) [ElSemi / R. Belmont].
- 27th November  2003: ElSemi fixed the erratic static sounds in the SCSP sound core.
- 26th November  2003: R. Belmont and ElSemi fixed various bugs in the SCSP sound core, improving the sound greatly in the ST-V driver.
- 0.76u2             : R. Belmont fixed SCSP crash with -nosound.
- 0.76u1             : Added sound\scsp.c/h and sound\scsplfo.c. Ported ElSemi's SCSP core, this gives preliminary sound in the ST-V games, however at the moment most of them play static, Shienryu is mostly correct [R. Belmont].
- 25th October   2003: R. Belmont added ElSemi's SCSP sound chip emulator to the ST-V driver, but the sound and music only works properly in Shienryu.
- NOTES: SCSP = Saturn Custom Sound Processor. This chip has 32 voices. Each voice can play a sample or be part of an FM construct. Unlike traditional Yamaha FM chips, the base waveform for the FM still comes from the wavetable RAM. Unsupported: FM mode (no known Model 2/3, Saturn, or ST-V game uses it) and on-board programmable DSP and related functionality.

S5.46  AICA

- 0.177              : Added ADPCM diff value clamp based on encoder research [kode54, MetalliC].
- 0.161              : ADPCM looping (DC swirl sound) and address masking (Red Dog) fixes (sound\aica.c) [MetalliC, Wind].
- 0.153              : Removed sound\aicalfo.c. EFREG is mapped every other word, not every word (sound\aica.c). Fixes memory trashing in all NAOMI/DC/AW games [O. Galibert, R. Belmont]. Rewrite AICA to modern device [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.150              : Added machine\aicartc.c/h. Small DEVICE_STOP cleanup in sound\aica.c [Oliver Stöneberg]. Implemented DMA. Hooked up AICA-to-SH-4 irqs. Device-ized AICA RTC device, passes RW comp test, doesn't pass clock test. Fixed AICA DSP. Fixed ARMRST behaviour. Fixed ARMRST behaviour (machine\dc.c) [Angelo Salese].
- 0.141u3            : Correct AICA slotmon readback. Streaming sounds now advance in e.g. capsnk [R. Belmont].
- 0.137u4            : AICA updates: [PluginNinja]: Implemented slot monitor. Improved ADPCM looping. General cleanup.
- 0.131u2            : Angelo Salese improved the debugging on the NAOMI Wave DMA handler and commented out the ACIA irq, was causing missing bgms in Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper.
- 0.128u3            : AICA update [R. Belmont, Deunan Knute, kingshriek]: Fixed missing instruments in DTPK driver games. NAOMI update [R. Belmont]: Unmapped words in the AICA address range must read as zero.
- 0.128u1            : Kingshriek fixed AICA sample addressing for the full 8 MB.
- 0.126u3            : AICA updates [Deunan Knute, ajax16384, R. Belmont]: Fixed ADPCM decoder to remove bad optimization and match YMZ280B. DC offset is fixed and output quality is higher. Improved handling of slot monitor and timers B and C. Simplified interpolation code.
- 0.125              : Kingshriek fixed an envelope corner case in the AICA.
- 0.124u1            : Fixed encoding/decoding of negative denormal floats in the AICA/SCSP DSP. Shouldn't actually affect any games [kingshriek, Deunan Knute].
- 0.123u6            : Zsolt Vasvari fixed AICA memory leak.
- 0.123u2            : Added sound\aica.c/h, aicadsp.c/h and aicalfo.c. Added and hooked up AICA (NAOMI sound chip). NAOMI boot sounds now play. Since it's an SCSPx2 with ADPCM instead of FM it's already feature-complete except filter envelopes. A bug in the ARM7 core causes incorrect pan/level values to be computed in e.g. the NAOMI SOUND TEST menu. This is not a defect in the AICA [ElSemi, Deunan Knute, kingshriek, R. Belmont].
- 20th February  2008: R. Belmont - Samuele Zannoli is at it again. Here's a few SH-4 bugfixes and NAOMI I/O board improvements later... I've also further improved the NAOMI audio emulation. No new samples this time, sorry.
- 17th February  2008: R. Belmont - A couple of nice coincidences linked together today. First up, I submitted the AICA core to MAME so NAOMI now has sound. Secondly, MAME Italia dumped the NAOMI game Toy Fighter, which successfully gets into it's test mode (gameplay doesn't work). Test mode includes the sound test, and here's what it sounds like (http://rbelmont.mameworld.info/naomi.mp3), with the "load times" cut out to make things managable. The first thing you hear is the NAOMI boot chimes - they're supposed to not be very loud, so do not crank your volume when you hear them. After that is song #1 in Toy Fighter's sound test.
-  8th February  2008: R. Belmont - I'm working on emulation of the AICA (the Dreamcast/NAOMI/Hikaru sound chip) behind the scenes with kingshriek and Deunan Knute (the Makaron author). Since AICA is basically an SCSP with double the voices and a few feature tweaks the obvious basis was MAME's now reference-quality SCSP emulation. That's allowed us to get to a pretty good state in a short amount of time. The ADPCM sample type isn't quite right yet, but the basic functionality and effects DSP are working. You can take a listen to the current code playing a piece from Sakura Taisen 4 right here (http://rbelmont.mameworld.info/sakutai4.mp3). Note: This is via a DSF rip, it doesn't mean Dreamcast works in MESS.
- NOTES: The AICA (NAOMI sound chip) is effectively a 64-voice SCSP, with the following differences: No FM mode. A third sample format (ADPCM) has been added. Some minor other tweeks (no EGHOLD, slighly more capable DSP).

S5.6   AY-3-8910A

- 0.188              : Improved -romident performance by dynamically allocating large arrays at device_start time (sound\ay8910.cpp) [Phil Bennett].
- 0.187              : Changed name 'AY-3-8910A' to 'AY-3-8910A PSG'. Added pinout and removed outdated comments from .h. Updated/fixed documentation and comments and added additional pinouts and links to decaps and documentation [Lord Nightmare, AJR]. Fixed device_clock_changed to respect the YM2149_PIN26_LOW flag. Fixes sound pitch is too high in Arkanoid, clones and Tournament Arkanoid [Lord Nightmare]. Document device names [AJR].
- 0.184              : Added a AY-3-8910 write handler for the case of bc1=a0 and bc2=a1. Fixed audio hookup in Popper (BC1 is hooked up to A0 on the host and BC2 is hooked up to A1) [Dirk Best]. Added guide to bus control signals [AJR]. Overrided device method to support changing clock frequencies in the AY8910. Added virtual keyword to declaration [Tim Lindner].
- 0.179              : Mention the OKI M5255, Winbond WF19054, JFC 95101, File KC89C72 and Toshiba T7766A as compatible / clone (sound\ay8910.h) [Osso]. Implement upper address check, not configurable at present but chips could be ordered from the factory with ID's other than 0. Allowing you to chain multiple chips without adding extra address lines. Don't hardcode AY8910 into logerror, using name() instead [smf].
- 0.178              : Slight improvements to AY8910 error logging, with some messages now disabled by default [AJR].
- 0.175              : Use osd_printf_verbose instead of popmessage in AY-3-8910 [AJR].
- 0.163              : Left a comment in sound\ay8910.c about I/O ports A and B. The I/O ports are designed as open collector outputs. Bits 7 and 8 of AY_ENABLE only enable (low) or disable (high) the pull up resistors. The YM2149 datasheet specifies those pull up resistors as 60k to 600k (min / max). We do need a callback for those two flags. Kid Niki (Irem M62) is one such case were it makes a difference in comparison to a standard TTL output [Couriersud].
- 0.156              : Fixed undefined behavior in AY-3-8910 initialization. Try zero-initializing dynamic array. Only build the table that will be actually used (per-channel or pre-mixed) [Alex Jackson].
- 0.154              : Cleanup of AY8910 this makes move to DEVCB2 possible, also now have better idea how to solve legacy STREAM_UPDATE [Miodrag Milanovic]. Converted ay8910_device and extended family to DEVCB2 [Osso]. Provide chip-specific details (number of outputs, number of usable IO ports) in constructor for each variant. AY8910 uses m_zero_is_off(1) constructor [Alex Jackson]. For AY891X emulate vol-0 resistor as infinite. Document recent measurements done on the AY8910. Updated information about measurements and model derived from those. AY8910_RESISTOR_OUTPUT now selects resistance calculation by simple saturation MOSFET model in ay8910.c. Currently only 1942 and Popeye use this. USE 64bit intermediary results in sound_stream::generate_resampled_data. This will allow sound drivers to make use of the full width of stream_sample_t (emu\sound.c). Adjusted maximum value suitable for streaming and removed some dead code (sound\ay8910.c) [Couriersud]. Silence compiler warning (sound\ay8910.c) [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.153              : Fixed noise period on AY8910 (see http://privatfrickler.de/blick-auf-den-chip-soundchip-general-instruments-ay-3-8910/) [Dr. Venom, Couriersud]. Added option AY8910_RESISTOR_OUTPUT to AY8910. This will output internal resistor values instead of computed voltages. To be used with netlist output stages [Couriersud].
- 0.150              : Setname corrections to further expand XML device coverage (sound\ay8910.c) [Tafoid].
- 0.148u5            : Modernised the AY8910. Simplified ay8910_start_ym now that all sound chips that use it are devices (sound\2203intf.c, 2608intf.c, 2610intf.c, ay8910.c/h) [smf].
- 0.144u3            : Added ay8910_reset_w() function, used by Joyful Road / Munch Mobile for resetting the AYs on-the-fly. Fixes substained sounds in the aforementioned game [Lord Nightmare, Angelo Salese].
- 0.141              : AY-3-8910 unused bits in registers read back as 0.
- 0.130u1            : AY-3-8910 improvements [Couriersud]: Fixed Gyruss audio regression. Measured RU and RD on AY-3-8910. Modelled ZX Spectrum audio circuit in SwitcherCAD and derived resistor values for AY-3-8910. Fixed any game that uses AY-3-8910: Envelope Fix causes notes tones to be played back incorrectly.
- 0.128u5            : Aaron Giles fixed wrong audio tempo in some drivers with Z80/AY8910.
- 0.127u5            : Couriersud fixed Leland AY8910/12 output combining.
- 0.124u5            : Couriersud fixed AY-3-8910/YM2149 and derivatives envelope handling.
- 0.124u4            : AY-3-8910 rewrite [Couriersud]: Added a model to calculate mixing of channels with different resistance loads. Based on above, each channel may be assigned a different load in individual case, i.e. channels not tied together. Rewrote ay8910.c to make emulation simpler. Changed the config structure to include a flag field and output resistor loads. Updated all drivers affected. Added some "Todos" related to stuff I discovered when reading datasheets. Fixed a bug in disc_flt.c (konami filters). Fixed discrete sound and konami filter addressing in galaxian driver. Also changed addressing of AY-3-8910 to be in line with schematics.
- 0.114u4            : Changed name 'AY8910' to 'AY-3-8910A'. Aaron Giles added several AY8910 variants (AY8912, AY8913, AY8930, YM2149, YM3439, YMZ284 and YMZ294) so we can better specify the use of compatible but slightly different chips.
- 0.103u4            : Aaron Giles added stream_set_sample_rate() call and converted the AY8910 sound core to output at their native sample rates, allowing the core sound system to perform over/re-sampling to the output rate.
- 0.93u1             : AY8910 no longer attempts to free memory allocated with auto_malloc [Aaron Giles].
- 0.93               : Changed name 'AY-3-8910' to 'AY8910'. Aaron Giles cleaned up the AY8910 interface for the YM chips to access this.
- 0.88               : Added save state support for AY8910 (thanks to Mame32Plus).
- 0.71               : Jarek Burczynski improved AY8910 noise generator.
- 30th June      2003: Jarek Burczynski and Olivier Galibert fixed the AY-3-8910 noise generator.
- 0.62               : Changed name 'AY-8910' to 'AY-3-8910'.
- 26th May       2002: Nicola Salmoria added a resample filter to the AY8910 emulator, but there isn't much of a quality improvement.
-  5th May       2002: Nicola Salmoria fixed the AY8910 emulator which caused missing sounds in some Irem M-62 system games.
- 30th November  2001: Aaron Giles improved the handling of AY8910 and YM2203 simultaneously.
- 0.55               : Tatsuyuki Satoh added support for using AY8910 and YM2203 at the same time, fixing sound in City Connection.
- 16th August    2001: Zsolt Vasvari fixed AY8910's behaviour with Lock'n'Chase.
- 0.36b15            : Removed sound\ay8910u.c. Source: Added gain support to mixer.c, through the new MIXERG() macro (extension of MIXER()). Removed the gain filed from AY8910, YM2203, YM2610 structures.
- 0.35b9             : Removed sndhrdw\8910intf.h.
- 0.35b2             : Zsolt Vasvari added Centipede (bootleg with AY8910 instead of Pokey).
- 0.34b4             : Changed sndhrdw\psg.c/h and psg.txt to sndhrdw\ay8910.c/h and ay8910u.c.
- 0.34b2             : Tatsuyuki Satoh updated the FM emulation and the way the 8910 updates its buffers.
- 0.33b7             : Nicola Salmoria changed the AY8910 emulation to generate three separate audio streams for the three channels instead of premixing them. This improves audio quality, increases the volume, and doesn't seem to affect performance too much.
- 0.31               : AY8910 support 16 bit samples as well [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- 0.30               : Tatsuyuki Satoh, Fabrice Frances, Nicola Salmoria and Pete Ground completely rewritten the 8910 emulator and interface. This affects a lot of games, but the one which benefits more is Gyruss: it now plays many sound effects which were missing. Nicola Salmoria changed the way 8910 sound is updated: There's no longer a fixed "updates per frame" value defined in the driver, instead the audio is stream is generated whenever a chip register is written to (and at every vblank). This improves sound quality in several games.
- 0.27               : Changed the 8910 sound chip emulation interface to allow updates more frequent than 60 per second [Nicola Salmoria]. I also increased the sampling frequency to 44.1kHz. These changes provide dramatic improvements in sound quality, which you can appreciate in e.g. Gyruss and Pooyan. The price to pay is slower execution. To make things worse, I had to (hopefully temporarily) remove some optimizations, so the above games will probably not run as well as before on slower systems.
- 0.20               : Changed 8910intf to support 5 PSGs (Gyruss have them!). 8910_sh_update() doesn't emulate the 8910 audio if sound is disabled [Nicola Salmoria] (the I/O ports of the chip are still emulated, since some games use them for input).
- 0.18               : Nicola Salmoria fixed bug in the 8910 emulation which caused noise to be played in Crazy Kong when you jumped over a barrel.
- 0.16               : Nicola Salmoria wrote some general purpose routines to simplify interface with the AY8910. They are in 8910intf.c. See the existing drivers for usage examples.
- 0.13               : Nicola Salmoria modified the 8910 emulator to set the clock frequency at run time, so sound in Crazy Climber and Crazy Kong is now back as normal.
- 0.12               : Since the 8910 emulator doesn't allow to set the clock frequency at runtime [Nicola Salmoria], I temporarily switched to using the default one. This affects sound in Crazy Climber, Crazy Kong and Bagman. Let me know whether it's better or worse than before.
- 0.05               : By popular demand, reverted to the old AY-3-8910 emulation code [Nicola Salmoria].
- 0.04               : New experimental AY-3-8910 sound emulation code provided by Andy Milne. This sounds better in some places and worse in others. It is used by Crazy Climber, Crazy Kong and Bagman.
- 0.02               : AY-3-8910 emulation by Ville Hallik and Michael Cuddy. Based on Sound.c from Marat Fayzullin's fMSX distribution, original source by Ville Hallik 1996. Michael Cuddy working on emulator for the classic video game Gyruss. Gyruss, along with many other video games of the early to mid 1980's (the golden age of video games, IMHO), used a programmable sound generator (PSG) chip from General Instruments called the AY-3-8910. The 8910 PSG is capable of generating three voices, with limited envelope control as well as a random "noise" channel. The 8910 also has two 8-bit I/O ports which could be read under program control. There were two other chips in the family, the AY-3-8911, and AY-3-8912. Both of these chips are identical to the 8910 from the programmers perspective, with the exception that the 8911 only had 1 I/O port and the 8912 had none. The 8910 (the real one), maintains a set of 15 registers internally. Programming these registers is done through two or three memory mapped or I/O mapped locations. The first location (Base+0x00) is a latch into which a register number is written. The second location (Base+0x01) can then be written to update the value of a register. The third location (Base+0x02) can be read to fetch the value of a register. Some hardware implementations will map the second two locations onto the same address so that a read or a write to a single locations "does the right thing". The actual values that should be programmed into these registers is beyond the scope of this document. Datasheets are available from Jameco Electronics (which also still stocks this part -- although the part is out of production: ones that I bought on 12/1996 were made in mid 1984 so Jameco may not have them for long. I have a copy of the datasheet, and I might put it up on my web site if my scanner decides to cooperate. If you are writing an emulator (and you probably are, since this code is of limited use to anyone else), you need to study the schematic or ROMS of the machine that you are trying to emulate to determine which memory address or I/O port the PSG(s) are mapped to.

- NOTES: This custom chip is a Fujitsu MB8843 MCU programmed to act as an I/O device with built-in coin management, protection device. It keeps track of the players scores, and checks if a high score has been obtained or bonus lives should be awarded. The main CPU has a range of commands to increment/decrement the score by various fixed amounts. The device is used to its full potential only by Bosconian; Xevious uses it too, but only to do a protection check on startup: CMD = command from main CPU and ANS = answer to main CPU. The chip reads/writes the I/O ports when the /IRQ is pulled down. Pin 21 determines whether a read or write should happen (1=R, 0=W).

This is not quite perfect yet but is closer to recordings and sounds a bit clearer (example: Time Crisis). Use word swap macro for C352 sound rom in Armadillo Racing and Prime Goal EX [Superctr].
- 0.177              : Replaced C352 core. The new core has working noise generator and sample interpolation. Rearrange C352 channels, removed rear channels for systems without second DAC. Rearrangement speakers for Namco NB2. Removed MACHINE_IMPERFECT_SOUND flags for C352 games [Superctr].
- 0.166              : The C352 clock divider appears to be configurable for each system (228 = Namcos System 11, 288 = System 22/Super 22/NB-12/ND-12/FL, 296 = System 23/Super 23 and 332 = System 12). Changed enum format. Fixed C352 clock divider in namcos23.c [Superctr].
- 0.163              : Added configurable clock dividers for Namco C352 [Superctr].
- 0.143u5            : Don't try to play zero-length samples in C352 [Phil Bennett].
- 0.143              : R. Belmont converted Namco C352 to modern C++ device.
- 0.127u3            : C352 cleanup [Olivier Galibert]: Removed an unused volume table dating from before the volume was (correctly) implemented as linear.
- 0.112u1            : Improvements to C352 sound emulator [cync, hoot development team]. Rewrote loop and flag handling, added support for global key-on register. Fixed state saving.
- 0.101u5            : Several fixes and improvements to the C352 sound emulator [hoot development team].
- 0.101u1            : Some improvements to C352 sound [cync].
- 0.99u9             : Major Namco sound improvements [R. Belmont]: C352 now sets output pitch correctly by input clock. Added emulated sound and music to all NB-1, NB-2 and System 11 games, using Prop Cycle's BIOS as a substitute until the original can be trojaned or otherwise obtained. Hooked it up for plain System 22 games as well, but they're not interested in passing down proper commands for some reason. Speed-cheated all instances of the M37710/C352 sound system so CPU requirements don't go up much. This also helped back off the requirements a hair for Prop Cycle and Time Crisis.
- 0.87u2             : C352 Pitch adjustment [R. Belmont, Cap].
- 0.86u3             : Namco C352 update [R. Belmont]. Many many fixes to wave start/end/bank handling plus added chain mode support. Thanks to cap @ VivaNonno for the tips.
- 0.86               : R. Belmont removed C352 debug printf that accidentally snuck in.
- 0.84u2             : Added sound\c352.c/h. R. Belmont added a preliminary core for the Namco C352 PCM chip. It was originally written by the Zinc authors for Zinc and has been adapted for MAME by R. Belmont with their permission. It's not sounding real great yet on music, although it's better than the Zinc original.
- 10th July      2004: R. Belmont - Added save states and a log-scale volume curve to the C352, which improves the music in a lot of games.
- 29th June      2004: R. Belmont - Started cleaning up ZiNc's H8/3002 core for MAME submission (this will add sound and fix protection on Namco Classics 1 & 2 and the System 12 games). Fixed some flag calculations on the ADD opcodes and some "edge cases" on the C352 to improve music in NCV1/2. Still need to fix some issues with the controls in Aqua Rush and Paca Paca.

- 0.106u9            : Nicola Salmoria changed the MSM5205 ADPCM decoder to no longer perform bounds checking to prevent the signal from overflowing. The MSM5205 data sheet clearly states that this isn't the case, and there is no overflow protection in the chip. Also, the chip's internal DA converter is just 10-bit, even if the processed signal is 12-bit.
- 0.93               : Aaron Giles removed ADPCM entirely and wired up dummy MSM5205s to most of the drivers still using it; these need to be revisited and fixed.

- 0.123u6            : Nicola Salmoria fixed MSM5232 noise LFSR formula (done by Jarek Burczynski; thanks to Corrado Tomaselli for samples). Changed MSM5232 emulator to output channels separately. Added output of SOLO channels to MSM5232 emulator.
- 0.57               : Added sound\msm5232.c/h. MSM5232 sound emulator [Jarek Burczynski, Hiromitsu Shioya]. Jarek Burczynski support MSM5232 in Fairy Land Story and Buggy Challenge.

- 0.145u7            : Check if OKI6295 voice is playing *before* possibly starting an invalid sample [hap].
- 0.144u7            : Don't refresh the stream during post_load, that makes the core die. Don't save-state the "was bank installed" flag and everything Just Works [R. Belmont]. This fixed use of save states in all sets using OKI6295 eventually crashes MAME upon loading.
- 0.141u1            : Added a virtual stream update function to the device sound interface. Added a new stream_create that takes fewer parameters and calls the device's stream update. Removed the stream update stub template. Updated BSMT2000 and OKIM6295 to use the new interface for their streams [Aaron Giles].
- 0.139u3            : Bulk converted all okim6295_r/okim6295_w references in the address maps to call to the modern member functions [Aaron Giles]. Added read_status() and write_command() methods to the okim6295_device for the common case where these are done outside the context of a read or write handler (it was annoying to pass in the fake address space for these cases) [Aaron Giles]. Replaced all remaining calls to okim6295_r/okim6295_w with calls to the new methods, and removed the static functions [Aaron Giles].
- 0.139u1            : Aaron Giles fixed all sets and drivers using OKI6295 audio. Eventual crash using Save States.
- 0.138u2            : Aaron Giles converted the OKI M6295 and EEPROM devices to the new model. These were necessary because they both require multiple interfaces to operate and it didn't make sense to create legacy device templates for these single cases (okim6295 needs the sound interface and the memory interface, while EEPROM requires both the NVRAM and memory interfaces).
- 0.132u4            : Aaron Giles converted the okim6295 sound driver to use address maps for access. By default, it defines a ROM address map that overlays its full region. As a result, the validity checks require all okim6295 regions to be at least 256k, unless you provide your own address map. Updated all regions to meet this requirement. Updated the atarijsa code to use a custom address space for its okim6295 accesses (which are banked on the first half and static on the second half), as an example of configuring a device with a custom address space. For now, attempts to use okim6295_set_bank_base() will still work, though banking for the okim chips should be moved to custom address maps in the drivers eventually. The first time okim6295_set_bank_base() is called, it will install a banked memory handler over the region and use memory_set_bankptr() to change the base on subsequent bank switches.
- 0.129u6            : Aaron Giles fixed noticeable static in OKI6295 audio.
- 0.129u1            : Phil Bennett updated OKIM6295 volume table to reflect actual chip behaviour. Removed "contact MAMEDEV" message.
- 0.128u6            : Relaxed the OKI 6295 command validity check [Nicola Salmoria].
- 0.128u5            : Nicola Salmoria changed OKI6295 to use a reasonable volume table derived from the manual. Added popmessages to notify of invalid commands so we can investigate them if some game uses them. It should also be noted that many games using this chip are clipping at the moment. This is something that might date back to when sound mixing was upgraded to 32-bit. It is sensible for the 6295 emulator to output at this level because it ensures that bits of precision are not lost, so the mixing levels in the drivers should be adjusted to avoid clipping.
- 0.111u6            : David Haywood fixed a couple of errors introduced in the OKI6295 pin shuffling.
- 0.111u3            : David Haywood moved OKIM6295 pin 7 state (internal divider) to internal structure. Updated all drivers to specify pin state when setting the interface. Added comments for all cases where the original frequency wasn't / 132 or /165 as the real pin state is unknown.
- 0.103u4            : Aaron Giles added stream_set_sample_rate() call and converted the OKIM6295 sound core to output at their native sample rates, allowing the core sound system to perform over/re-sampling to the output rate.
- 0.96u1             : Aaron Giles added ADPCM utilities to OKIM6295.c and used those to hook up sound once again in the Seibu games.
- 0.93u1             : Aaron Giles fixed several issues with banking and playback in the OKI6295.
- 0.93               : Added sound\okim6295.c/h.
- 0.77               : R. Belmont fixed a driver to allow to have MSM6295s and plain ADPCM voices coexist (required for gcpinbal).
-  1st November  2003: R. Belmont fixed the ADPCM functions so that games can have both MSM6295 sound chips and plain ADPCM at the same time, and he added complete sound emulation to Grand Cross Pinball.
- 0.63               : Changed name 'OKI6295' to 'MSM6295'.
- 17th December  2002: Nicola Salmoria fixed a bug in the OKIM6295 sound chip emulation that caused samples being played erroneously in Got-cha and Steel Force, and he sent in a driver for Got-cha.

- 11th July      2001: Luca Elia fixed OKI m6295 emulation from crashing with sound disabled.
-  2nd April     2001: Jarek Burczynski added state saving support to ADPCM and OKIM6295 sound emulation cores.
- 23rd October   2000: Takahiro Nogi added bank switching function for M6295 samples and tweaked playback frequency in the Toaplan2 driver.
- 20th June      2000: Bryan McPhail fixed some YM2151/OKIM6295 sound balance problems in several drivers.
- 23rd July      1999: Jim Hernandez fixed Vapor Trail sound with the new OKI6295 interface.
- 22nd July      1999: Bryan McPhail sent in a driver for Crude Buster, and modified OKI6295 core to support different frequencies.
- 24th April     1999: Nicola modified the ADPCM sounds of Klax to change volume as the pieces come closer.
-  8th February  1999: Bryan McPhail made the ADPCM code support two OKI 6295 chips with samples in different memory regions.
- 0.31               : Aaron Giles improved ADPCM support, plus support for the OKIM6295 ADPCM chip. Several drivers use these.

- 0.142u6            : James Wallace added proper channel 2 support, and logging capabilities to OKIM6376. Corrected divider behaviour of OKIM6376 - needs ROM analysis to be complete, but all supported programs only use the default mode. Fixed NAR timing in OKIM6376 to match datasheet figures. Fixed behaviour for OKIM6376 samples latched while their respective channel is playing (fixes missing audio in New Magic Card 'Skill Game' when won on first loop), and MPU4 sound test.

- 0.168              : Make the NES APU device get added with the N2A03 CPU rather than needing to be added in every driver I believe this to be correct, it's internal to the CPU?. Notes: DERIVED_CLOCK doesn't work in cases where MCFG_CPU_MODIFY is used to modify the clock, so I've had to use MCFG_CPU_REPLACE in those cases instead. Sound routing seems a bit messy, but this seems a general MAME thing, we still have an issue where if you add too many devices with their own speaker/sound additions things you get sound overflows, in this case all drivers except NES were set to a 0.50 sound level output, NES was set to 0.90, I see no clean way to do this with the sound chip inside the CPU?

Belmont - If you have a Konami PowerPC-based game or PCB with the RF5c400 sound system (check system16 or MAWS if you aren't sure - this includes games like Gradius 4, Solar Assault, NBA Play By Play, Thunder Hurricane, Thrill Drive, Racing Jam, and more) and it's in good working order, I need some samples off one to fix up the RF5c400 emulation in MAME/M1/hoot. Please PM me on one of the 3 boards I read: bannister.org, www.mame.net, or www.mameworld.info if you can supply stereo mp3 samples of such a machine.

- 0.128u5            : Aaron Giles fixed all sets with HuC6280 as Audio Device (PCE-Based titles): Fatal Error after OK.
- 25th November  2007: Charles MacDonald - The HuC6280 PSG used in the PC Engine and several Data East arcade games has six "tone" channels which output a short waveform (32 x 5-bit samples) repeatedly. The last two channels have independent random noise generators that replace the tone output, which generate one bit per sample, interpreted as the minimum ($00) or maximum ($1F) sample value. For the purposes of accurate emulation it would be useful to know exactly how the random data is generated. This involves two steps; analysis of the recorded noise output and determining the type of random noise generator being used. Both the tone and noise channels can be configured to run at the same frequency. I chose the slowest ones, $00 for noise and $3E for tone output which is approximately 1804 Hz. The tone output was loaded with a square wave, such that within one sample of the noise output (one bit) there is a full square wave on the tone output. This provided a reference "clock" for the noise "data", which was used for extracting the noise bitstream from the recorded output of the chip. The clock had one transition at the same time the noise output changed and another in the middle when the output has settled somewhat. During playback, the tone sample buffer index is not necessarily in sync with the noise output, it can be offset by up to 32 samples. By toggle the frequency of the tone channel briefly using the control pad, it was possible to change the index. With a little trial and error you can get the two perfectly aligned. I'm not too familiar with audio processing in general, but I could see that the problem of extracting digital data from an analog source was something a Schmitt-triggered input would be capable of doing in an electronic circuit. I implemented this in software, in the form of a program that would look at both channels and reconstruct the clock and data bitstreams by applying hysteresis to the recorded samples. When the clock had a negative pulse, the data was in a valid state and it's current state was recorded. This type of processing also had the advantage of being able to handle situations where the noise output had multiple 1's or 0's in sequence; the output would decay towards zero after an initial peak, but the hysteresis prevented this from looking like a sequence of "100000" rather than it's actual value of "111111". With the bitstream reconstructed, it was time for some analysis. One way to generate random bits is with a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) something that is easy to implement in hardware. Gridle pointed out a very useful program that implements the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm for determining the shortest LFSR that matches a given bitstream: http://www.qualcomm.com.au/PublicationsDocs/b-m.c  According to the program it was a LFSR! The LFSR was 18 bits, with bits (LSB) 0, 1, 11, 12, and 17 (MSB) tapped. Assuming a right-shift on each clock pulse, the bit shifted out is the noise sample. The tapped bits are XOR'd together and inserted into bit 17. After /RESET is asserted the LFSR is initialized with bit 0 set and all other bits reset. It has a maximum sequence of 131071 bits before repeating. To confirm this I wrote a test program that generated a bitstream based on the LFSR, and then searched for that sequence within the extracted bitstream from a recording. As expected the generated bitstream was found and it repeated every 131071 bits within the recording. I wanted to see which registers affected the LFSR, but as it turns out none of them do except for the LFSR frequency control. If the channel is turned on or off, noise is turned on or off, or if any other setting is adjusted, the LFSR always runs at the specified noise frequency. Apart from a reset, the LFSR state can't be changed. I did a few more recordings at other frequencies and on other systems (using a mix of HuC6280 and HuC6280A chips) to confirm the results; and indeed the findings were identical each time. The only unknown is how the random noise generator of the PC-FX sound chip works, which contains the same PSG core with ADPCM output added. One of these days I'd like to look at the random noise generator used in the Namco NA-1 board, it's internal state can be read and written during playback, and clocked 'manually' one step at a time. It should be possible to extract the bits without recording any samples and analyze that directly.

- 0.148u5            : Added QSound internal DSP ROM to the device [Andrew Gardner]. FILE location update (sound\qsound.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 12th January   2013: Andrew J. Gardner - Remember the last post below? The one where Dr. Decap decapped a mystery chip? Well, as noted on his blog shortly after (which now appears to have departed), it was the QSound chip, found in nearly every CPS2 game and a handful of others (zn.c & cps1.c). QSound is a chip capable of spatializing sound samples in a 3d manner. To do this, a Head Related Transfer Function is run on the sounds as they are played. In the QSound chip, this function is executed by an on-die AT&T DSP16A CPU, currently unemulated in MAME (its CPU core is only a disassembler). MAME's QSound emulation already plays audio samples, but not in their fully-spatialized awesomeness, so to get the full QSound experience we need to emulate the DSP16A so it can run its internal program on the samples. As with many of these decaps, the HRTF program was locked away in the QSound chip. Two years ago, the doc photographed it, and things began to unfold. The doc's photos were decent, and after some work by s_bastian, the monkeys sprung into action. All the bits were typed up within a couple of weeks, and we had ourselves a bit pattern. Problem was, this one was very difficult to decode. I tried and failed (twice), and every few months I'd prod other devs to see if they were up to the challenge. At least one of them found it really difficult as well. But then, near the end of 2012, Quench (as with a lot of other decap decodings) saved the day, giving us a proper decode. And here we are... A good deal of work remains before the QSound DSP16 HRTF algorithm runs in MAME, but we're on our way. The DSP16A CPU core needs its opcodes implemented so it can run the software us monkeys typed up, and the glue logic inside the QSound chip will need to be figured out as well. Adding to the challenge, a few difficult regions of the decap photos mean a few opcodes might be wrong, and given that this is the only dump we have of DSP16A software (unless someone out there finds additional software?), it will be a challenge to make work correctly. All-in-all this is great new for QSound fans! Thanks to Quench, hopefully now it will just be a matter of time before the DSP16A in the QSound chip runs its proper HRTF algorithm on the sound samples. MAME 0.148 contains a few opcodes for the DSP16 CPU core, and more will be forthcoming. Keep an eye on the whatsnew.txt for work on the DSP16A CPU core. The better this core gets, the more potential MAME has for emulating the QSound chip properly. I'll do my best to report any successes (big or small) we might have along the way.
- 0.148              : Modernize the QSound sound device [Andrew Gardner]: The one that started it all. It works now. No idea what I was doing wrong before, but I'm not doing it anymore. It appears as though a clean build might be necessary for this one to take. I've tested more CPS2 games than I care to mention, a bunch of zn games, and a cps1 game and they all are happy, so we should be good. Now for the fun stuff...
- 0.109u1            : David Haywood added bounds checking to the Qsound driver.
- 0.94u1             : Aaron Giles fixed '3 speaker problem' with Qsound.
- 0.93               : Changed name 'QSound' to 'Q-Sound'.
- 0.88               : Added Qsound save state support (thanks to Mame32Plus).
- 27th December  1999: Paul Leaman sent in a small Qsound update to the alternate Qsound player.
- 0.36b11            : Changed sndhrdw\cpsq.c to sound\qsound.c/h. QSound player (preliminary) [CAB, Paul Leaman, Miguel Angel Horna].
-  5th December  1999: Paul Leaman merged his and Miguel's Qsound cores.
-  4th December  1999: Miguel Angel Horna sent in yet another Qsound update.
- 30th November  1999: Miguel Angel Horna submitted yet another Qsound driver, which sounds pretty good now.
- 28th November  1999: Miguel Angel Horna and Paul Leaman both submitted a Qsound driver, but neither of them are working correctly.
-  1st August    1999: Paul Leaman added some kind of sound to the Qsound games, but frequency and length of the samples aren't yet right.
- 0.35               : Added sndhrdw\cpsq.c.
- 30th June      1999: Paul Leaman sent a new CPS-1 driver with stub functions for the Qsound system. It doesn't play anything yet, but simple sample playing shouldn't be far off.
- 13th February  1999: More progress on the CPS1 driver. Some of the later CPS1 games utilizing the Q-sound system are now working (such as Cadillacs & Dinosaurs, Punisher and Warriors of Fate), and a few minor bugs have been fixed. No sound though, because the Q-sound roms are encrypted. Information about 'Kabuki' encryption system is very welcome.

- 0.186              : Updated QSound/DL-1425 ROM and comments with corrections from recent decap [Lord Nightmare, Siliconpr0n, superctr, Quench].
- 0.180              : Changed the DSP16A disassembler to use 'std::ostream &' internally [Nathan Woods]. Fixed a bug in DSP16 caused by incorrect use of macro [Vas Crabb].
- 0.153              : Changed cpu\dsp16\dsp16ops to dsp16ops.inc [Oliver Stöneberg]. DSP16 has an internal /2 divider [hap].
- 0.149u1            : DSP16 improvements [Andrew Gardner]: Fixed R=M disassembly. Added flag formatting. Shadow register is hooked up. Opcode & flag fixes.
- 0.148u5            : Added the QSound internal DSP ROM to the device [Andrew Gardner].
- 0.148u1            : Additional DSP16 opcodes & disassembly fixes. The PC moves on from potentially all used DSP16 opcodes now. I believe I've roughed in each of the opcodes the QSound program uses (every opcode the dsp16 has except three, apparently). Even without all flags being set and conditions being tested, reasonable memory regions are being accessed. Unfortunately, though, I've found what I believe to be my first bad opcode (at PC=03e6 and will have to do a bit of spelunking to see what I can make of that). Switch -> if (dsp16\dsp16ops.c) [Andrew Gardner].
- 0.148              : Added cpu\dsp16\dsp16ops.c. Added DSP16 registers and implemented the goto opcode. Added DSP16 16-bit immediate load opcode. Fixed reset behavior. Code reorganization. Fixed compile (dsp16_device_start()). DSP16 simplification and additional work. Few more DSP16 opcodes & spaces->tabs. Two more DSP16 opcodes for the fixed-point math enjoyment [Andrew Gardner]. Fixed U64 compile issues [Angelo Salese].
- 0.147              : Oliver Stöneberg fixed some printf format string warnings reported by Cppcheck (cpu\dsp16\dsp16dis.c).
- 0.141u2            : Added cpu\dsp16\dsp16.c/h and dsp16dis.c. A new WE DSP16A CPU disassembler [Andrew Gardner].
- 24th January   2011: Dr. Decapitator - The Capcom DSP16A (#17 on the status page) has been decapped.

- 0.148u1            : Modernized Irem GA20 sound device [Andrew Gardner].
- 0.112              : R. Belmont rewroted faux x86 assembly in the Irem GA20 sound core.
- 0.94u1             : Changed name 'Irem_GA20' to 'Irem GA20'.
- 0.93               : Sound System update [Aaron Giles]. Acho cod... transmission lost.
- 0.89u5             : IremGA20 64-bit crash fix [Stephen Behling].
- 0.80u2             : R. Belmont added channel status readback to the GA-20, which fixes some occasional odd voice-stealing behavior I've heard playing R-Type Leo.
- 0.79u2             : R. Belmont fixed Irem GA-20 pitch.
- 18th February  2004: R. Belmont - Reverse-engineered the proper pitch calculation for the Irem GA-20 sound chip and submitted to MAMEdev. I no longer need samples from those games. Thanks to Fujix, Yasuhiro Ogawa, the Guru, and Tormod for real PCB samples that made this possible.
- 17th February  2004: R. Belmont - Japump has kindly sent samples from an R-Type Leo and Guru's got a Gunforce. Samples from any other games using an Irem GA-20 are still needed though.
- 14th February  2004: R. Belmont - Looked into the pitch calculation for the Irem GA-20. I have something that works a lot better (R-Type Leo's music all matches the OST now) but it's still not perfect. I need PCB recordings from the test menu of a GA-20 based game (R-Type Leo would be great, but any MAME m92.c or m107.c game would probably work). Please private message me on one of the 3 boards I read (the bannister.org M1 board, the MAME.net board, or the MAMEWorld boards) if you can do this.
-  7th January   2003: Bryan McPhail fixed the IremGA20 sound chip emulation from crashing if sound was turned off.
- 30th May       2002: Acho A. Tang did a few small cleanups in various drivers and improved the Irem GA-20 sound chip emulation slightly. Applied hyperbolic gain control to volume and used a musical-note style progression in sample rate calculation(still very inaccurate).
- 18th April     2002: Acho A. Tang improved the Irem GA-20 sound chip emulation which helps some of the games on the Irem M-92 hardware. Rewrote channel mixing and added prelimenary volume and sample rate emulation.
- 11th January   2002: Acho A. Tang submitted a modification to the Irem GA20 sound chip emulation, which partially fixes some sample pitch problems in the Irem M-92 driver.
- 0.37b8             : Added sound\iremga20.c/h. Preliminary Irem GA20 sound emulation [Bryan McPhail]. Bryan McPhail added preliminary sound in Blade Master, Gunforce, UUCops and Lethal Thunder.
- 11th September 2000: Bryan McPhail sent in a huge Irem games update with a rewritten NEC core, fixing many bugs. R-Type Leo title screen was fixed as well as preliminary Irem GA20 custom sample player support was added.

S19.    Ensoniq

S19.1   ES5503

- 0.163              : Improved Ensoniq 5503DOC Swap Mode. If one oscillator is in swap mode, its partner should be treated as being in swap mode, even if it is set to one shot. This behavior is undocumented in literature from Ensoniq, but exploited by software developers. This change allows Ninjaforce's NinjaTracker to correctly play looped instruments [NJRoadfan].
- 0.153              : ES5503 use DEVCB2 instead of custom callbacks [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.147u4            : Make the number of ES5503 output channels configurable [O. Galibert].
- 0.147              : Preserve ES5503 phase when oscillators loop. Fixed IRQ timing error introduced when I did the device conversion [R. Belmont].
- 0.145              : R. Belmont cleared all ES5503 oscillator params on reset. This fixed Moonquake exception in debug build. Note: I couldn't reproduce the crash reported under any build on any OS, but Valgrind indicated out-of-bounds reads without this change and none with it.
- 0.143u5            : Converted ES5503 to modern device, improved IRQ timing [R. Belmont]. Changed name 'ES5503' to 'Ensoniq ES5503'.
- 0.142u2            : Properly mask ES5503 oscillator enable bits when setting [R. Belmont].
- 0.114              : R. Belmont made behavior of ES5503 IRQ status register more accurate.
- 0.113u4            : ES5503 updates [R. Belmont]: Major fixes to IRQ semantics and end-of-sample handling. Sample memory now configurable. Added state save support. Calculates output rate properly based on the input clock. Hooked up properly to Moonquake.
- 0.113u3            : ES5503 improvements [R. Belmont]: Fixed extraneous click at end of samples. Improved timing behavior. Fixes music tempo in many Apple IIgs apps and games in MESS.
- 0.109              : R. Belmont fixed ES5503 behavior for voice volumes > 127 (cures missing sounds/music notes in several Apple IIgs demos and games).
- 0.105u3            : Added sound\es5503.c/h. ES5503 emulation [R. Belmont].
- 16th March     2005: R. Belmont - I submitted first-pass working ES5503 emulation to MESS for their now-in-CVS Apple IIgs driver.
- NOTES: The ES5503 was the next design after the famous C64 "SID" by Bob Yannes. It powered the legendary Mirage sampler (the first affordable pro sampler) as well as the ESQ-1 synth/sequencer. The ES5505 (used in Taito's F3 System) and 5506 (used in the "Soundscape" series of ISA PC sound cards) followed on a fundamentally similar architecture.

- 0.179              : Fixed ES5505/6 readback of global registers when the current page was in a certain range. Made voices run for a zero-length loop, as real hardware does it and synthesizers rely on it. These changes fixed the playback of "Transwaves" on the (MESS) VFX and SD-series synths [Christian Brunschen].
- 0.177              : Attempt to fix ES5505 32bit crash [Osso].
- 0.154              : Converted es550x_device to DEVCB2 [Osso].
- 0.152              : Modernized ES5505 device [Osso].
- 0.146u3            : Stop spamming error.log [hap].
- 0.146u1            : ES5505/6 actually use the ADC port read callback [R. Belmont]. Removed es5505_set_channel_volume() hack [Phil Bennett].
- 0.144              : Angelo Salese added per-channel volume control to ES5505/ES5506 sound chip, and hooked it up to the Taito F3 driver.
- 0.136u4            : Fabio Priuli added save state to both ES5505 and ES5506.
- 0.103u4            : Aaron Giles added stream_set_sample_rate() call and converted the ES5505/6 sound core to output at their native sample rates, allowing the core sound system to perform over/re-sampling to the output rate.
- 0.98u3             : Jarek Burczynski fixed subtle bug in ES5505/6 interpolation code.
- 20th April     2003: R. Belmont fixed a few memory leaks in the ES550x sound core.
- 16th November  2002: Nicola Salmoria added preliminary sound CPU communication to the Macross Plus driver, but sound doesn't work yet due to an unemulated IRQ feature in the ES5506 sound core.
- 0.60               : Acho A. Tang improved Irem GA20 emulation, used by M92 games.
-  3rd April     2002: Aaron Giles fixed a potential crash bug in the ES550x sound chip emulators, but this doesn't fix anything else.
- 0.53               : Aaron Giles fixed a ES550x bug that caused Taito F3 and Incredible Tech games to sound bad.
-  4th August    2001: Aaron Giles fixed the ES-550x sound bug which caused scratchy sound.
- 27th January   2001: Bryan McPhail sent in a Taito F3 sound update, with the sound cutting out bug fixed and stereo sound implemented (it was mono before).
- 0.37b11            : ES5505/6 emulation [Aaron Giles].
- 16th January   2001: Aaron Giles fixed a small interpolation bug in the ES5505 core.
- 15th January   2001: Bryan McPhail finally submitted his Taito F3 driver, which is not graphically perfect and crashes hard sometimes but has complete ES5505 sound emulation thanks to Aaron Giles, Ian Schmidt and R. Belmont.
- NOTES: The Ensoniq ES5505/6 sound emulation for the Taito F3 games eats lots of memory as 8 bit PCM data is decoded as 16 bit for use by the current ES5505 core.

S19.4   ES5510

- 0.189              : Added util\server_http_impl.hpp and server_ws_impl.hpp. Refactor server_{ws,http}.hpp into separate interface and implementation. Refactor server_{ws,http}.hpp into separate interface and implementation headers. When shutting down the HTTP server, also explicitly stop the asio::io_context (emu\http.cpp) [Christian Brunschen].
- 0.188              : Added an external panel for the (MESS) Ensoniq VFX family of keyboards, with a websocket interface and an HTML/Javascript implementation that can be served over HTTP. Better handle the case where HTTP is not enabled (emu\http.cpp) [Christian Brunschen].
- 0.152              : Cleaned up (MESS) driver esqkt.c and use real ES5510 device [R. Belmont].
- 0.150              : Improved ES5510 debug capabilities, better disassembly, bugfixed many opcodes. Most effects programs now produce correct results. Fixed saturating ALU operations, greatly improving the behavior of many programs [Christian Brunschen].
- 14th August    2013: R. Belmont - Moving on from the last post, Christian made some additional fixes to the effects processor so now the "rotating speaker" effect works. In case you're unfamiliar with what that means, you'll probably understand quite quickly listening to this. It's a classic sound used in the blues, rock, jazz and even electronica.
-  5th August    2013: R. Belmont - Christian Brunschen continued working on the Ensoniq synthesizer components and got the ES5510 effects processor chip working. Some bugs definitely remain, but by and large the effects programs for the 16-bit Ensoniq synthesizer drivers in MESS now do what they're supposed to. One standout example: the VFX has a patch called "GATED-DRUMS". For those not versed in music production, "gated reverb" was the process used by Phil Collins and his engineer to make drums sound huge on 1980's "In The Air Tonight". This became *the* signature drum sound of the 1980s and gated reverb was widely used on records from about 1983 to 1992. Now, the VFX wisely saves ROM by using existing clean drum samples and using the ES5510 effects processor to apply the "gating" process for the "GATED-DRUMS" patch.
- 0.149u1            : Preliminary hookup ES5510 to ES5505/5506. Samples are passed through unchanged for now (cpu\es5510\es5510.c/h, es5506.c/h, audio\taito_en.c, drivers\itech32.c, macrossp.c and ssv.c) [Christian Brunschen]. Dropped ESS5505/6 levels in driver to make up for changes in core which under normal levels caused VERY loud audio and clipping. Note: This is a temporary fix until the core itself can be made to react as it did before the last sound core change [Tafoid].
- 0.148u2            : Added missing breaks in es5510_device::write_reg() [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.148u1            : Added cpu\es5510\es5510.c/h. Initial implementation of Ensoniq ES5510 DSP. This doesn't actually process samples yet, but it's pretty close to doing so, we just need OG to figure out how that works in the core [Christian Brunschen]. Compile fix (cpu\es5510\es5510.c). Added proper replace func and made it always use that one [Miodrag Milanovic]. Additional portability fixes [R. Belmont]. Fixed uninitialized memory in cpu\es5510\es5510.c [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.146u1            : Taito Ensoniq improvements [Phil Bennett]: Use the common 68681 DUART implementation. Implemented the MB87078 volume control.
- 0.144              : Angelo Salese added a preliminary ES5510 DSP DRAM input/output latches support in Taito F3 driver, fixes sound in Ring Rage and Riding Fight.

- 0.141u1            : Added a virtual stream update function to the device sound interface. Added a new stream_create that takes fewer parameters and calls the device's stream update. Removed the stream update stub template. Updated BSMT2000 and OKIM6295 to use the new interface for their streams [Aaron Giles]. Replaced BSMT2000 HLE emulator with emulation of the original TMS32015 [Dr. Decapitator, Andrew Gardner, Quench, Guru, Ernesto Corvi, Peter Grounds, Lord Nightmare, Aaron Giles].
- 21st January   2011: Andrew J. Gardner - The last chip Dr. Decapitator expertly decapped was the BSMT2000. s_bastian's typing tool was used by the following mameworld members to type 65,536 bits 3 times each: amarok, angrylion, Armatic, ASI, bdam, Brian Troha, Canim, casper, ChuKy, Cpt. Pugwash, DarylC, Dr. Spankenstein, drewcifer, fireinthehole, franciscohs, Fungo, john666, Klez, Layne, leniad, Lord_Nightmare, Malice, MAMu_, MASH, mitice, MonkeyEgg, MrDuncanM, NaokiS, niiiih, Osso, Qun Mang, Rad R, real, SothoTalKer, superultrahyper, s_bastian, TAZ-NZ, Various For, Warpath0007, Xiaou2, x_wins and Zer0. Decoding the ROM was very challenging this time around. Numerous people, myself included, have looked at it for a good chunk of time, but have gotten nowhere. Earlier this week, Quench, with some expert suggestions from Dr. Decapitator, figured it out! It was especially tricky since some bits were burned 'forward' and some 'backward' in alternating patterns. Quench fully decoded the ROM and handed it to Aaron, who hooked it up to the BSMT2000 device in MAME. The emulation of Brian Schmidt's classic sound chip should now work in MAME 100% as it originally did. If there are any bugs, please report them on MAMETesters after the next u release. In related news, the doc just photographed another sound chip. This one is used by dozens of games, and is only partially emulated in MAME. I'm in the process of stitching the new set of images together, and will hand it over to s_bastian when it's done. Stay tuned to the mameworld news board for further announcements!
-  6th January   2011: Andrew Gardner - Thanks to the following typists (in alphabetical order), the dump is complete! amarok, angrylion, Armatic, ASI, bdam, Brian Troha, Canim, casper, ChuKy, Cpt. Pugwash, DarylC, Dr. Spankenstein, drewcifer, fireinthehole, franciscohs, Fungo, john666, Klez, Layne, leniad, Lord_Nightmare, Malice, MAMu_, MASH, mitice, MonkeyEgg, MrDuncanM, NaokiS, niiiih, Osso, Qun Mang, Rad R, RagingBoner, real, SothoTalKer, superultrahyper, s_bastian, TAZ-NZ, Various For, Warpath0007, Xiaou2, x_wins and Zer0. Out of 65,536 bits (8 kilobytes), 17 bits are questionable, even after 3 people typed them. Five of these are completely obscured and will require disassembly to figure out, 9 of them have pretty good guesses, but I marked them to be checked in the disassembly anyways, and 3 of them are pretty obviously in the middle of big globs of 1's, but I marked them as questionable just in case. Thanks to s_bastian's ever-maturing monkey-tool, it took me roughly 30 minutes to look through the results, fix the mis-typed bits, and take note of the bits we're still unclear about. This is a vast improvement in time spent over what it would take one or two people to do it, and bodes well for the future. There was, on average, roughly 0.5 mistakes per image, and only in four cases did everyone disagree about a single bit. We still have to decode these bits into a ROM and feed it through a TMS320C15 disassembler, but that will come in due time. In the meantime, thank you again to s_bastian, all y'all typists, and to Dr Decapitator, whose images are so high quality this is a joy to do!
-  3rd January   2011: Andrew Gardner - s_bastian has done it again! This time it's the BSMT2000 chip used in all sorts of groovy stuff (BSMT2000). It's monkey-time: http://www.progettoemma.net/dump/
-  2nd January   2011: Dr. Decapitator - Chip #23 (BSMT2000), a TMS32015 with mask ROM, used on Battle Toads, Police Trainer, Sharpshooter, Tattoo Assassins, Double Cheese, Fred Flintstones' Memory Match, Lotto Fun 2 and Data East pinball machines, has been decapped. You can see the ROM area in the picture below in the top left (in 2 sections).
- 0.113              : Aaron Giles rewrote the BSMT2000 to be more accurate. Various modes are now software selected at startup based on the register value at reset time. Changed all existing drivers so they properly hooked up the reset line on the chip in order to make this control work. Also added correct BSMT2000 ADPCM output.
- 0.112              : Aaron Giles removed linear interpolation from the BSMT2000 by default since the original chip did not do interpolation.
- 0.104u4            : Aaron Giles added save state support to the BSMT2000 sound emulator and the dcheese driver.
- 0.103u4            : Aaron Giles added stream_set_sample_rate() call and converted the BSMT2000 sound core to output at their native sample rates, allowing the core sound system to perform over/re-sampling to the output rate.
- 0.57               : Added sound\bsmt2000.c/h. BSMT2000 sound emulator [Aaron Giles].

- 0.153              : Fixed copy and paste errors in sound\spu_tables.c [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.148u5            : Improved save state behavior, but still needs work (sound\spu.c) [R. Belmont].
- 0.148u4            : Move CDDA interrupt to play_cdda to make sure it happens at least once per sector. (MESS) Vibribbon doesn't crash now starting gameplay but there's no music. It seems to copy the samples to the reverb loop address which doesn't appear to be mixed currently [Carl].
- 0.148u3            : Added CDDA interrupts to sound\spu.c. Don't overrun SPU ram [Carl].
- 0.148u2            : Fixed uninitialized member in emu\sound\spu.c. Fixed uninitialized memory in emu\sound\spureverb.c [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.148u1            : (MESS) PlayStation: Play XA audio at the correct speed (sound\spu.c). Fixed PlayStation sample signedness and stream rate for CDDA (redbook) audio (sound\spu.c and machine\psxcd.c). Attempt better XA/SFX volume balance (sound\spu.c) [R. Belmont].
- 0.141u3            : Changed sound\psx.c/h to sound\spu.c/h. Added sound\spureverb.c/h and spu_tables.c. Replaced PSX SPU with a much more complete implementation [pSXAuthor, R. Belmont]. R. Belmont corrected SPU IRQ notification in all drivers. Fixes streaming audio in Simpsons Bowling.
- 14th February  2011: R. Belmont - After porting over the pSX audio emulation, I brought pSX's CD emulation over to MESS. That gets us some working commercial games. (More games run than are shown here, this is just the first two I tried). Big thanks to pSXAuthor for his generosity!
-  5th February  2011: R. Belmont - Arguably the most problematic aspect of MAME's PSX hardware emulation was the SPU audio chip. It had no envelope support, no reverb, and an assortment of bugs. Fortunately most arcade games use the SPU only for sound effects and have a separate chip for music so the problems weren't as dire as a working MESS PSX driver might have shown, but glitches did occur and vex players (for instance, the siren in Tetris the Grand Master). Anyway, pSXAuthor, the author of the pSX emulator gave us permission a while ago to use his SPU code in MAME. The problem at the time was that his code makes heavy use of C++ features and MAME back then was plain C only. Aaron's recent architectural changes have finally made it possible to rock out with your polymorphic classes out in a sound chip emulation, and so I've finally done the port. One thing the MESS driver does do is play .PSF music rips from PlayStation games. I'm going to use one of my favorite songs from one of my favorite PS1 games (Parasite Eve) here to demonstrate the before/after. I think you'll find the improvement quite striking.
- 0.130u3            : Simulate 'keyoff' in the SPU. The envelopes aren't actually emulated, but the sound is silenced after a key-off (by placing the sound in a 'release' state). This prevents audiable sound from looping forever [David Haywood].
- 0.129u5            : Quick hack to delay installing the SPU DMA handler until the first write to the SPU as driver init is now called after the devices are created [smf].
- 0.93               : Changed name 'PSX_SPU' to 'SPU'.
- 0.84               : Several PSX SPU improvements [smf]: Added PIO SPU ram writes. Fixed status register read/write. Internal mixer clamps output to 16 bits to fix distortion. State saves all registers. Removed the need for casts by making the decoded sample buffer signed. DMA read/writes are limited to the SPU ram.
- 0.80u3             : R. Belmont added Konami GV System driver. The SPU emulation needs a lot of help, especially on Wedding Rhapsody. smf is working on it.
- 19th February  2004: smf added preliminary PSX SPU sound emulation and fixed the standalone MIPS disassembler.
-  6th February  2004: R. Belmont - The always fabulous Pete B. (http://sourceforge.net/projects/peops/) is donating his P.E.Op.S SPU code to MAME, so we'll have sound soon too.
- 15th January   2004: R. Belmont - smf is working on the PSX SPU (sound chip) which will get the rest of the sound working in the Konami GV games.
- 0.78               : Added sound\psx.c/h. Preliminary PSXSPU emulation [smf].

- 0.186              : Changed name 'ES8712' to 'Excellent Systems ES8712 ADPCM'.
- 0.183              : Working sound and music in Last Bank. Added busy status read to ES8712 and notes on device. Added a reset line callback for the ES-8712. This will be used to reset the MSM5205/MSM6585 when the implementation is rewritten to use those devices. For now, it's used for IRQ generation in vmetal, whose program seems to use a separate gate to prevent unwanted IRQs when the device is reset (gcpinbal appears to do the same with a rather subtle difference). Removed the probably bogus and already unused auto-repeat feature from the ES-8712 device. All known games that loop samples do so by status polling or IRQs [AJR].
- 0.148u2            : Modernized ES8712 sound device [Andrew Gardner].
- 0.95u6             : Added sound\es8712.c/h. Quench added new ES8712 sound core and hooked up sound in Varia Metal.
- NOTES: The ES8712 chip from Excellent Systems generates a singel channel ADPCM stream. Samples are currently looped, but whether they should and how, is unknown. Interface to the chip is also not 100% clear. Should there be any status signals signifying busy, end of sample - etc?. Core is heavily borrowed from the OKI M6295 source.

Enhanced the mixer interface support to allow for more than one output line. To use this you need to use the MCFG_MIXER_ROUTE macro instead of MCFG_SOUND_ROUTE so that the mixer output index can be specified. See midway_ssio_device for an example. The SSIO PROM has been moved to within the Midway SSIO device now [Aaron Giles]. Added 'Midway SSIO Sound Board' sound.
- 0.122u6            : Aaron Giles added clocks to the MCR sound boards and some of the MCR games. Added TMS5220 variants TMS5200 and TMC0285 as proper chips. Changed MCR squawk & talk to use the TMS5200 as documented.

S24.4   Leland

- 1st generation sound hardware was controlled by the master Z80. It drove an AY-8910/AY-8912 pair for music. It also had two DACs that were driven by the video refresh. At the end of each scanline there are 8-bit DAC samples that can be enabled via the output ports on the AY-8910. The DACs run at a fixed frequency of 15.3kHz, since they are clocked once each scanline.
- 2nd generation sound hardware was used in Redline Racer. It consisted of an 80186 microcontroller driving 8 8-bit DACs. The frequency of the DACs were controlled by one of 3 Intel 8254 programmable interval timers (PITs). The clock outputs for each DAC can be read, and are polled to determine when data should be updated on the chips. The 80186's two DMA channels are generally used to drive the first two DACs, with the remaining 6 DACs being fed manually via polling.
- 3rd generation sound hardware appeared in the football games (Quarterback, AAFB) and the later games up through Pigout. This variant is closely based on the Redline Racer sound system, but they took out two of the DACs and replaced them with a higher resolution (10-bit) DAC. The driving clocks have been rearranged a bit, and the number of PITs reduced from 3 to 2. Like the 2nd generation board, the first two DACs are driven via the DMA channels, and the remaining 5 DACs are polled.
- 4th generation sound hardware showed up in Ataxx, Indy Heat, and World Soccer Finals. For this variant, they removed one more PIT and 3 of the 8-bit DACs, and added a YM2151 music chip and an externally-fed 8-bit DAC. The externally driven DACs have registers for a start/stop address and triggers to control the clocking.

First thing I recently submitted is a "new" sound device: the DMA-driven DAC. This is essentially what the DCS and CAGE sound systems do. They start their chip's internal DMA controller, point it at the sample data, and let the DMA controller stream the data to the DAC(s). Since I had written this code twice (once for DCS, once for CAGE), and since the Gaelco 3D games use a similar technique, I decided to formalize the code into a new common sound device.

- 27th December  2005: Aaron Giles - I'm looking for someone out there who has a 2D Midway game with a DCS sound system. This would include Mortal Kombat 2, Mortal Kombat 3, NBA Hangtime, WWF Wrestlemania, 2 On 2 Open Ice Challenge, or Rampage: World Tour. Basically, I need to know how much RAM there is for the ADSP chip. If the system is on an external card, this is pretty easy, just identify the RAM chips on the card and let me know what they are. For the Wolf unit games, I think the sound system is on-board, so you'll just need to identify the smaller RAM chips (they will probably be 8kx8 or 32kx8 parts). In fact, knowing this info for the Cruisin' and Killer Instinct games would be useful as well.

Use device finder to connect seibu_sound_device to audiocpu. kothello has only one YM2203 and one ADPCM, not two of each. Future changes planned: Separate SEI0100BU and SIE150 types; Cabal and Dead Angle should each be using two of the former. Separate SEI80BU device to handle Z80 decryption (Mustache Boy uses this for its main CPU). Moved SEI80BU encryption out of the SEIBU_SOUND device and make it a device of its own. Added MCFG_DEVICE_ROM to override region tag for device_rom_interface [AJR].
- 0.157              : Changed name 'Seibu ADPCM' to 'Seibu ADPCM (MSM5205)'. Removed unused functions (audio\seibu.c) [Alex Jackson].

- 0.124u1            : Stephane Humbert changed Seibu sound CPU to use AM_READ_PORT("COIN") (seibu_sound_map) instead of input_port_0_r.
- 0.122u6            : Aaron Giles cleaned up memory maps in the Seibu sound interfaces. Changed to use shared sound configs instead of statically copying them in each driver.

- 0.36b12            : Added sndhrdw\seibu.c/h.
- NOTES: The Seibu sound system comprises of a Z80A, YM3812, YM3931 and OKI MSM6205. As well as sound the Z80 can controls coins and pass data to the main cpu. There are a few little quirks that make it worthwhile emulating in a seperate file: The YM3812 generates interrupt RST10, by asserting the interrupt line, and placing 0xd7 on the data bus. The main cpu generates interrupt RST18, by asserting the interrupt line, and placing 0xdf on the data bus. A problem can occur if both the YM3812 and the main cpu try to assert the interrupt line at the same time. The effect in the old MAME emulation would be for sound to stop playing - this is because a RST18 cancelled out a RST10, and if a single RST10 is dropped sound stops as the YM3812 timer is not reset. The problem occurs because even if both interrupts happen at the same time, there can only be one value on the data bus. Obviously the real hardware must have some circuit to prevent this. It is emulated by user timers to control the Z80 interrupt vector.

- 0.166              : Minor Sound Blaster corrections [kazblo].
- 0.164              : Corrected Sound Blaster 1.0 clock to 7.159 MHz [kazblox].
- 0.155              : Added isa\sb16.c/h. Added Soundblaster 16 low level emulation. The diagnose program mostly works but I'm sure there are still many more bugs, it definitely isn't near as usable as the HLE (at least yet) [Carl, Malice, O. Galibert]. Removed unused m_bps variable [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.154              : Fixed irqs and 16bit DMA [Carl].

- 0.148u1            : Sound Blaster MIDI Out support for single-byte, SB UART and MPU-401 UART modes. Improved MIDI throttling. Working SB-MIDI In (tested w/MIDI Monitor for Windows). Fully hooked up MPU-401 input and output for SB16. Added save state registrations to Sound Blaster [R. Belmont].
- 0.148              : Partially implement sb16 mixer [Carl]: Fixes Simcity 2000. Removed unneeded &&1 in machine\isa_sblaster.h.
- 0.147              : Added Sound Blaster 16, and proper 16 bit ISA DMA handling. Added 2, 3 and 4bit ADPCM support. Improved the isa_blaster ADPCM and simplifies the DSP protection, based on the ATI Stereo FX rom. Corrected the output in ADPCM mode and inhibits irqs after the protection command. Test-sbc.exe works again [Carl].

24.H   Gravis Ultrasound

- 0.154              : Converted GUS to DEVCB2 (isa/gus.c) [Osso].
- 0.153              : Changed mess\machine\isa_gus.c/h to bus\isa\gus.c/h. Rewritten 6850 based on datasheet using external CLOCK & removed MIDI clock hacks. GUS gf1_device device derives from acia6850_device to gain access to the tx & rx irq state, rather than exposing it with a public method [smf].
- 0.148u1            : Enabled 6850 MIDI interface in Gravis Ultrasound (machine\isa_gus.c) with a hopefully accurate clock, and fixed a silly error with MIDI IRQs, and passes the MIDI transmit IRQ test. It still slows the drivers down a bit, but now only by about 20-25%, might be a bit more manageable now. Also, is there any way to tell if the 6850 triggers an IRQ on recieve or transmit, as the GUS has separate flags for each case. Otherwise, it can't pass the MIDI recieve IRQ test. Added Gravis Ultrasound MIDI In and Out. Note: MIDI Out seems to work fine with Win 3.1 MIDI Mapper and Media Player. To use with these, open MIDI Mapper, and edit the General MIDI setup, and change each channel from "Ultrasound MIDI Synth" to "Ultrasound MIDI Output Port". MIDI In is untested, and the MIDI Receive IRQ test still fails. Fixed audio streaming in the Windows GUS drivers, and added a hacky workaround for Win95 setting invalid IRQ settings [Barry Rodewald].

- 0.161              : Fixed keyboard error in 'Keyboardmania 3rd Mix' (machine\midikbd.c) [K2-git].
- 0.160              : Fixed memory leak warning (autorelease pool) on OSX (portmidi\pm_mac\osxsupport.m) [Couriersud]. Added ability to completely disable MIDI (lib\osdobj_common.c) [qmc2].
- 0.159              : Added modules\midi\midi_module.h. Converted MIDI into a module [Couriersud].
- 0.155              : MIDI sound: Added note about memory leaks (portmidi\pmlinuxalsa.c) [Oliver Stöneberg]. Rejected invalid MIDI bytes with no status, fixes most 6850-based MIDI setups (osd\osdcore.c) [R. Belmont].
- 0.154              : Removed portmedia\pmmidi.inc and windows\winmidi.c. Converted MIDI device to DEVCB2 [Osso]. Allow "default" for -midiin and -midiout (osd\osdcore.c) [R. Belmont].
- 0.153              : Changed portmedia\pmmidi.c to pmmidi.inc [Oliver Stöneberg]. Moved mess\machine\midiinport.c/h and midioutport.c/h to emu\bus\midi\. Added bus\midi\midi.c/h. Call set_data_frame() before stc_rcv_rate() in imagedev\midiin.c and midiout.c, as since r26274 there is random behaviour if you don't. Separated MIDI devices. Removed local lists of MIDI devices in (MESS) drivers as they are currently all the same [smf]. Fixed MIDI output (bus\midi\midi.c) [R. Belmont].
- 0.150              : Added sound\esqpump.c/h. Ensoniq 16-bit: SQ series are 21-voice, not 32. Fixes tuning vs. h/w. SQ also don't have an FDC (drivers\esq5505.c). MIDI System Common messages should not override running status, fixes Sierra games crashing with the MT-32 (portmedia\pmmidi.c). Separate Ensoniq "pump" device out from ESQ5505 [R. Belmont]. Fixed some SysEx issues (portmedia\pmmidi.c) [Christian Brunschen]. Sorted out ESQ5505 BIOSes for the SD-1 family: Newly dumped 3.0 for 21-voice, allow selecting 4.02 or 4.10 for 32-voice [Christian Brunschen, R. Belmont].
- 0.149u1            : Ensoniq: Document latest panel protocol findings (machine\esqpanel.c and esqvfd.c). Ensoniq 16-bit: Better A/D parameter handling, allow panel device to send new analog data (drivers\esq5505.c and machine\esqpanel.c) [Christian Brunschen].
- 0.149              : Added machine\midikbd.c/h. firebeat: Splitted MIDI keyboard to separate device [Carl].
- 0.148u2            : IRQ_CALLBACK_MEMBER cleanup (mess\drivers\esq5505.c) [Miodrag Milanovic]. Fixed memory leak in find_default_device() (lib\portmidi\finddefaultlinux.c) [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.148u1            : Added emu\imagedev\midiin.c/h, midiout.c/h and machine\midioutport.c/h. MIDI core updates [R. Belmont]: Added MIDI in and out ports as image device types. Added OSD calls to check for and read MIDI input. Added MIDI in image device which reads input and converts it to a serial bitstream (imagedev\midiin.c). Note that the MIDI In device uses the new image device override to prevent the core from attempting to fopen() the "file" name and instead it handles open/close itself in call_load/call_unload. This allows greater flexibilty than the hack used for sockets/ptys/named pipes where the OSD file layer has to know about them. Added MIDI In capability to all of these drivers (mess\drivers\esq5505.c). Allow MIDI input port to work without a connected real device. More fun with older OS X (portmidi\ptmacosx_mach.c). Fixed compiling on PowerPC OS X (portmidi\osxsupport.m + readbinaryplist.c and osd\sdl\sdl.mak). First pass on MIDI out support (imagedev\midiout.c/h and machine\midioutport.c/h). Fixed several MIDI bugs and bumped the input buffer sizes. Handle MIDI Out with running status properly (osd\portmedia\pmmidi.c). Enable transmission of SysEx messages. Preliminary SysEx reception support [R. Belmont]. Fixed DEBUG compilation of portmidi\pmwinmm.c [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.148              : Initial commit of PortMIDI [R. Belmont]. This isn't enabled to compile yet, this is just to make it easier to run the final tests on my Mac and my Windows laptop. Enable compiling PortMidi. Tested on: Linux x64, Mac OS X 10.8 and Windows 8 x64 w/latest toolchain for both OSD=windows and OSD=sdl. MIDI should auto-disable on other OSes (*BSD) but there may be problems. Works fine on Linux when set to use the system's copy of the library as well, which many distros prefer. Fixed compile on OS X 10.6/10.7 (portmidi\readbinaryplist.c) [R. Belmont]. Fixed portmidi Visual Studio warnings. Fixed portmidi library name [Oliver Stöneberg]. Fixed portmidi compilation on Xcode 3.2.6 for OSX 10.6.8 [Fabio Priuli].

S26.    Speech processors


S26.1   DAC Speech
- 0.34b3             : Brad Oliver fixed speech in King & Balloon. Ernesto Corvi fixed speech in Karate Champ.
- 0.36b1             : Zsolt Vasvari added "Get Ready!" speech to Grobda. The hardware in Grobda automatically cycles the bottom 6 address lines of sound RAM, so they probably added a latch loaded when the bottom 4 lines are 0010 (which corresponds to locations not used by the sound hardware). The program writes the same value to 0x02, 0x12, 0x22 and 0x32. However, removing the 15XX from the board causes sound to disappear completely, so the DAC might be built-in after all (see drivers\mappy.c).
- 0.33b2             : Nicola Salmoria added speech to Champion Baseball.
- 0.31               : Nicola addes speech in Mat Mania.



S26.2   Texas Instruments

S26.21  TMS0285

- 0.72u1             : Nathan Woods added support for the TMS0285 variant (an old variant of the TMS5220).
- NOTES: The tms0285 is an early variant of the TMS5220 used in the ti-99/4(a) computer. The exact relationship of this chip with TMS5200 & TMS5220 is unknown, but it seems to use slightly different tables for LPC parameters.
- SOURCE: sound\tms5220.cpp


S26.22  TMS5100

- 0.168              : Fixed TMS5xxx for occasional audio 'spike' instability/wraparound glitches caused by improper truncation in the lattice filter multiplier. This is not an optimal fix as it isn't correct to hardware, but it works better than the previous approximation [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.148u4            : Corrected and verified TMS5100 LPC table against the decap (sound\tms5110r.c) [digshadow, Lord Nightmare].
- 0.148u3            : TMS5100 and 5200 series: Document the decapping and verification of chirp tables for the tms5100, tms5200, tms5220, and tms5220c. The LPC tables are not verified yet [digshadow, Lord Nightmare].
- 0.141u3            : Lord Nightmare fixed the interpolation coefficient shifts for the TMS5xxx chips based on results of simulating the circuit from the patent.
- 0.127u2            : Lord Nightmare updated TMS5100 LPC tables based on mathematical analysis of 1st and 2nd derivatives of the values and comparison to the best quality patent image, which nearly always showed which values were in error. Some off-by-one issues may remain, but it is now nearly perfect. Further perfection will require PROMOUT dumping, which is planned.
- 0.125u1            : Lord Nightmare fixed the chirp table implementation in both the 51xx and 52xx chips.
- 0.122u2            : Couriersud added coefficient maps for TMS5100 and M58817 from documented sources to tms5110r.c. Also changed CVS driver to use TMS5100 according to PCBInfos and "game system operational" now sounds more natural.

S26.23  TMS5110

- 0.188              : Implemented device_clock_changed [AJR].
- 0.184              : Updated some comments [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.174              : Changed sound\tms5110r.inc to tms5110r.hxx.
- 0.168              : Fixed TMS5xxx for occasional audio 'spike' instability/wraparound glitches caused by improper truncation in the lattice filter multiplier. This is not an optimal fix as it isn't correct to hardware, but it works better than the previous approximation. Added more verbosity to DEBUG_LATTICE [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.166              : Got rid of the request_bits and FIFO implementation in TMS51xx, both of which were incorrect to hardware. Minor ZPAR fix. Some comment cleanup. Finally fixed zpar logic correctly. Purge process() of gotos to hopefully make the compiler's optimizer happier. Added same FAST_START_HACK as in TMS5220, makes (MESS) Speak & Math word delay closer to hardware. Minor comment fixes and changes to debugging log data. Fixed an TMS5110/5220 off-by-one in the interpolator causing the k5 coefficient to not be zeroed during unvoiced frames. Fixes various speech glitches. Comment updates (sound\tms5110r.inc). Fixed incorrect TMS5110/5220 implementation of pitch zero which caused an improperly long period with no pitch at an interpolation inhibited -> voiced boundary. Moved unvoiced parameter zeroing into the frame parser, as on the original chips. Some minor TALK/SPEN state machine changes as well, which should have minimal effect. Added some notes about the tms51xx interpolator bug [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.165              : Added correct CD2802 chirp rom from decap (sound\tms5110r.inc) [Sean Riddle]. Replaced the frame parse and speech generation code from tms5110.c with the code from tms5220.c, should be significantly more accurate and allow the cores to be much more easily merged in the future. This also allowed finally getting rid of the COEFF_ENERGY_SENTINEL hack in tms5110r.inc. Updated the interpolation tables to use the "IP" (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7) instead of logical (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0) order. Fixing the initial coefficient index values. Removed target_x variables in favor of reloading from coefficient ROM during the generation loop (as the real device does). Implemented proper ZPAR and unvoiced ZPAR logic for zeroing parameters during idle and unvoiced frames. Changed the pitch zeroing logic during frame inhibit to last an entire interpolation period rather than one sample. Replaced the speech-is-synthesizing state machine with the original patent TALK, TALKD and SPEN bits. Redid the talk_status logic to use (TALKD || SPEN) as the real device does. Fixed stupid typo, doesn't fix the cvs.c Gold Bug sound inconsistency yet [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.163              : Added new LPC table data for CD2802, CD2801 and TMS5110A/TMC0281D. Added new information regarding each chip. Reorganize LPC tables to use #defines rather than repeating identical data [PlgDavid, Lord_Nightmare, NullMoogleCable]. Corrections to some comments in sound\tms5110r.inc [Lord Nightmare]. Added CD2801/TMC0280 chirp table [Digshadow, PlgDavid, Lord Nightmare]. Fixed missing cast for chirp/excitation values, fix a potential off-by-one for tms5110.c as well [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.157              : Implemented TMS5110 output and read bit commands. Fixed VSM rom read through the TMS51xx. This breaks the speech in Radar Scope (TRS01), because the rom it has has the bits in the backwards order. I will fix this later [Lord Nightmare]. Fixed usage of uninitialized member in tms5110_device. Happened with (MESS) Speak & Spell [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.154              : Removed legacy handlers (sound\tms5110.c), now that no drivers use them anymore. Updated TMS5110 to use DEVCB2 [Fabio Priuli]. Converted tmsprom_device to DEVCB2 [Osso].
- 0.153              : Changed sound\tms5110r.c to tms5110r.inc [Oliver Stöneberg]. Updated TMS5110 to use newer chirp table, based on decap (sound\tms5110r.inc). Note: The TMS5111NLL was decapped and imaged by digshadow in April, 2013. The LPC table is verified to match the values from Jarek's PROMOUT dump of the TMS5110, and the die even says "TMS5110AJ" on it. It uses the 'newer' 5200-style chirp table [Lord_Nightmare, digshadow].
- 0.150              : Small DEVICE_START cleanup in sound\tms5110.c [Oliver Stöneberg].

- 0.148u4            : Verified TMS5200 LPC rom as correct from decap (sound\tms5110r.c). Corrected and verified TMS5100 LPC table against the decap (sound\tms5110r.c) [digshadow, Lord Nightmare].
- 0.141u3            : Fixed the interpolation coefficient shifts for the TMS5xxx chips based on results of simulating the circuit from the patent. Changed 'Chirp table' waveform to match the chip more closely, acoustically. This will require completion of a pending decap to verify as correct, but it certainly sounds better [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.138u2            : Couriersud added a new cycle exact VMS interface to TMS5110 emulating M0, M1 and ADD1 to ADD8 lines. Added TMS6100 memory controller device. Also added TMSPROM device emulating Bagman and A. D. 2083 prom controlled speech logic. Switched Bagman, A. D. 2083 (scramble.c) and Radar Scope (TRS01) to use the new interface and devices. Added documentation about TMS5110 prom interface used by Bagman and A. D. 2083.
- 0.137u3            : Lord Nightmare massive merge of TMS5110 and TMS5220 cores, TMS5220 side only so far. Much code by Jarek Burczynski merged. Lattice Filter, Multiplier and clipping redone. TMS5220C multi-rate feature added. Now using the same LPC table file (and format, as created by Couriersud) as the TMS51xx is. Unvoiced-Voiced transitioning adjusted to match patent. Command handling redone to better match patent. Reasonably significant speech quality improvements: Separate tables for TMS5200, TMS5220 and TMS5220C are implemented, though all still need to be verified from hardware. Fixes: Garbled speech in Escape from the Planet of the Robot Monster's Canal Mazes is fixed, as well as some other garbled speech in game (when saying 'throwing switch' for instance).
- 0.134u1            : Partially implemented TMS5110_CMD_TEST_TALK [Couriersud]: According to the documentation, this needs to be issued to read status on CTL1. CVS driver needs this. TMS5110 improvements [Couriersud]: Implement CTL port input/output for status reads. Input/output is switched by clocking pdc after a TALK STATUS command. Update drivers to support new tms5110_ctl_r. Now exhibits Rom Clock signal.
- 0.133u3            : Removed sound\5110intf.c/h. Aaron Giles merged 5110intf into TMS5110.
- 0.127              : Oliver Stoenberg removed duplicated TMS5110 entry in sound.mak.
- 0.125u2            : Lord Nightmare added proper interpolation sub-cycles to the TMS5110 and TMS5220 ('PC' cycles and A/B subcycles of each) and updated comments.
- 0.125u1            : Lord Nightmare fixed the chirp table implementation in both the 51xx and 52xx chips.
- 0.122u7            : Couriersud added all known variants of the TMS5110 as proper chips. Updated dkong, cvs and scramble to use new chips.
- 0.122u4            : Couriersud completed TMS5110A code for the game 'A. D. 2083'. Working speech synthesis.
- 0.122u3            : Fixed TMS5110 tables [Couriersud, Lord Nightmare].
- 0.122u2            : TMS51xx and M58817 speech updates [Couriersud]: Removed sound\m58817.*. Added support for multiple coefficients maps to tms5110.*. Fixed interpolation factors (see tms5110r.c for reason). Made lattice calculation precision 9bit. Added support for READBIT and LOADADDRESS commands to tms5110.c. More changes in line with various patents. Documented TRS-02, TKG-02/03 "voice" interface.
- 0.111u5            : Lord Nightmare fixed PRNG noise in the TMS5110/5220 code and added signal wrapping to match the patent.
- 0.111u1            : Lord Nightmare fixed a problem with the chirp tables of both the TMS5220 and the TMS5110. Also backported Jarek's PRNG implementation from tms5110.c to tms5220.c so it no longer relies on rand().
- 0.103u4            : Aaron Giles added stream_set_sample_rate() call and converted the TMS5110 sound core to output at their native sample rates, allowing the core sound system to perform over/re-sampling to the output rate.
- 0.101              : Aaron Giles added save state support to TMS5110 sound chip.
- 0.94u1             : Aaron Giles fixed games using the TMS5110 (sound\5110intf.c) which refused to start (Bagman, CVS driver etc.).
- 0.93u1             : Aaron Giles adding missing memset when initializing the TMS5110 and TMS5220 structures; should prevent the crashes. Fixed signed/unsigned error in the TMS5110 core.
- 0.92               : Jarek Burczynski added real noise generator to TMS5110.
- 0.37b6             : Added sound\tms5110.c/h, tms5110r.c, 5110intf.c/h. TMS5110 emulator, used by Bagman and Super Bagman [Jarek Burczynski].
-  8th August    2000: Jarek Burczynski wrote a TMS5110 emulator and added speech support to Bagman.
- NOTES: "perform dummy read" is not mentioned in the datasheet of the TMS5110. However Bagman speech roms data are organized in such way so bit at address 0 is NOT a speech data. Bit at address 1 is data speech. Seems that the TMS5110 is performing dummy read before starting to execute a SPEAK command.

S26.24  TMS5200

- 0.168              : Fixed TMS5xxx for occasional audio 'spike' instability/wraparound glitches caused by improper truncation in the lattice filter multiplier. This is not an optimal fix as it isn't correct to hardware, but it works better than the previous approximation [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.167              : Fixed a TMS52xx bug where if the FIFO contained exactly 0 bytes and a SPEAK (VSM) command was issued, the command would instantly terminate due to the FIFO being empty even though the chip wasn't in SPEAK EXTERNAL mode. Fixes speech in (MESS) TI Extended Basic [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.163              : Added new LPC table data for CD2802, CD2801 and TMS5110A/TMC0281D. Added new information regarding each chip. Reorganize LPC tables to use #defines rather than repeating identical data [PlgDavid, Lord_Nightmare, NullMoogleCable].
- 0.150              : Small DEVICE_START cleanup in sound\tms5220.c [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.148u4            : Verified TMS5200 LPC rom as correct from decap (sound\tms5110r.c) [digshadow, Lord Nightmare].
- 0.148u3            : Removed sound\tms5220r.c. Added correct TMS5200 chirp rom derived from decap; This is now used for 5200, 5220 and 5220c pending decaps of the latter two. Removed tms5220r.c which hasn't actually been compiled/used by speech code for around 2 years now, and fixed the makefile [digshadow, Sarayan, Lord Nightmare]. Extremely minor fix for Speak External based on the 5220c and 5200 decaps, and some small documentation updates [Lord Nightmare, digshadow]. TMS5100 and 5200 series: Document the decapping and verification of chirp tables for the tms5100, tms5200, tms5220, and tms5220c. The LPC tables are not verified yet [digshadow, Lord Nightmare].
- 0.142u5            : Minor updates to the TMS52xx comments and the disabled-by-default pulse excitation code to better match how hardware would probably work [Lord Nightmare, Neill Corlett].
- 0.141u3            : Lord Nightmare fixed the interpolation coefficient shifts for the TMS5xxx chips based on results of simulating the circuit from the patent.
- 0.138u4            : Fixed timing of TMS52xx OLDP and OLDE updates to happen on the correct IP/PC cycles, should very slightly improve sound/reduce clicking for TMS5200 and TMS5220 games [Lord Nightmare] (missing from whatsnew).
- 0.138u3            : TMS52xx now uses proper IP/PC/Subcycle counting for audio generation [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.137u4            : Lord Nightmare replaced TMS5200 table with table extracted using PROMOUT from actual chip. Money Money sounds much better.
- 0.125u7            : Zaccaria updates [Couriersud]: Removed TMS5220 kludge. Hooked up new RS/WS/READY TMS5220 interface. Removed DAC1 as well. Replaced it by attenuation control for AY2 - channel B. This fixed TMS5200 hookup bug, which is currently kludged to work. Atari Ace fixed a few build problems with the TMS5200 sound core.
- 0.125u1            : Lord Nightmare updated TMS5200/5220 documentation and comments. Fixed the chirp table implementation in both the 51xx and 52xx chips.
- 0.122u6            : Aaron Giles added clocks to the MCR sound boards and some of the MCR games. Added TMS5220 variants TMS5200 and TMC0285 as proper chips. Changed MCR squawk & talk to use the TMS5200 as documented.
- NOTES: The TMS5200/TMC0285 coefficients were directly read from an actual TMS5200 chip by Lord Nightmare using the PROMOUT pin, and can be regarded as established fact. The chirp table contents were read from a decap done by digshadow in March 2013. The interpolation coefficients still come from the patents pending verification of the interpolation counter circuit from the chip decap image vs the patent. Note that the K coefficients are VERY different from the coefficients given in the US 4,335,277 patent, which may have been for some sort of prototype or otherwise intentionally scrambled. The energy and pitch tables, however, are identical to the patent. Also note, that the K coefficients are ALMOST identical to the coefficients from the CD2802, above.

S26.25  TMS5220

- 0.188              : Use device_clock_changed instead of custom method and misc. modernization [AJR].
- 0.173              : TMS5220/5110 merge Part 1. Added a 'combined rs/ws write' function for systems which require both pins to change at exactly the same time and not to reset the chip [Lord Nightmare]. Replaced fprintf by logerror; fixed some small issues [Michael Zapf].
- 0.168              : Fixed TMS5xxx for occasional audio 'spike' instability/wraparound glitches caused by improper truncation in the lattice filter multiplier. This is not an optimal fix as it isn't correct to hardware, but it works better than the previous approximation. Added more verbosity to DEBUG_LATTICE. Fixed missing savestate entries in tms5220.cpp [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.167              : Fixed a TMS52xx bug where if the FIFO contained exactly 0 bytes and a SPEAK (VSM) command was issued, the command would instantly terminate due to the FIFO being empty even though the chip wasn't in SPEAK EXTERNAL mode. Fixes speech in (MESS) TI Extended Basic [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.166              : Implemented talk status state machine properly as shown by patent. Got rid of m_target_* hack in favor of loading data from ROM as needed. Fixed ZPAR logic. Fixed pitch zeroing to match(?) patent. Purge process() of gotos to hopefully make the compiler's optimizer happier. Added a hack so Victory's "Shields Up" sample and the sample afterward aren't corrupted. Removed outdated comments and other comment updates to TMS5220. Fixed an TMS5110/5220 off-by-one in the interpolator causing the k5 coefficient to not be zeroed during unvoiced frames. Fixes various speech glitches. Fixed incorrect TMS5110/5220 implementation of pitch zero which caused an improperly long period with no pitch at an interpolation inhibited -> voiced boundary. Moved unvoiced parameter zeroing into the frame parser, as on the original chips. Some minor TALK/SPEN state machine changes as well, which should have minimal effect. Added some notes about the TMS51xx interpolator bug [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.165              : Minor cleanups to TMS5220 so savestate and member variables are in the same order. Added a missing savestate entry. Fixing the initial coefficient index values [Lord Nightmare]. Fixed interpolation on TMS52xx to match samples from real chip [PlgDavid, Lord Nightmare].
- 0.163              : Fixed missing cast for chirp/excitation values in TMS5220 [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.161              : Some preparation for a possible future merge of TMS51xx and 52xx into one .c file [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.154              : Fixed usage of uninitialized members in tms5220_device [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.150              : Small DEVICE_START cleanup in sound\tms5220.c [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.149u1            : Doing the TMS5220 dummy read immediately on reset [Michael Zapf].
- 0.149              : Minor TMS5220 WIP, commented for now [Lord Nightmare]. Inserted checks to prevent debugger access [Michael Zapf].
- 0.148u5            : Modernised TMS5220 [smf].
- 0.148u4            : Updated many TMS5200 comments, changed a variable name, and made some minor fixes to the 'circuit 412' to better reflect the patent. Based on decap analysis, both the TMS5220 and TMS5220C use identical LPC tables; get rid of the unnecessary extra table [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.148u3            : Removed sound\tms5220r.c. Added correct TMS5200 chirp rom derived from decap; This is now used for 5200, 5220 and 5220c pending decaps of the latter two. Removed tms5220r.c which hasn't actually been compiled/used by speech code for around 2 years now, and fixed the makefile [digshadow, Sarayan, Lord Nightmare]. Extremely minor fix for Speak External based on the 5220c and 5200 decaps, and some small documentation updates [Lord Nightmare, digshadow]. TMS5100 and 5200 series: Document the decapping and verification of chirp tables for the tms5100, tms5200, tms5220, and tms5220c. The LPC tables are not verified yet [digshadow, Lord Nightmare].
- 0.147u3            : Got rid of most of the TMS5220 excitation (voicing) hacks. The rest is mostly making the space/tabs for comments more consistent and fixing a couple of spelling errors in the comments. Minor bugfix regarding the time_to_ready code [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.146u2            : Class re-implementation, appended to legacy version [Michael Zapf].
- 0.145u8            : Various Clang warning cleanups in sound\tms5220.c [Balrog].
- 0.142u6            : Force TMS5220 OLDP and OLDE to be updated only on the A subcycle of IP=0 PC=0; this has no effect whatsoever on the output, it is merely to better document how the chip works [Lord Nightmare]. Emulate TMS5220 circuit 412 from the patent, which should prevent spurious clicks on interpolation-inhibited frame transitions; This may improve the tie fighter sounds in Star Wars, and some clicking in EPROM/EPROMa [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.142u5            : Minor updates to the TMS52xx comments and the disabled-by-default pulse excitation code to better match how hardware would probably work [Lord Nightmare, Neill Corlett].
- 0.142u1            : Lord Nightmare updates to comments and nonstandard feature defines (tms5220.c). Partially fixed perfect interpolation hack, disabled by default. Fixed perfect interpolation hack the rest of the way, now it works as it did before 0.140 or so. Improved perfect interpolation hack slightly, should be less noisy after inhibit frames.
- 0.141u3            : Lord Nightmare fixed the interpolation coefficient shifts for the TMS5xxx chips based on results of simulating the circuit from the patent.
- 0.138u4            : Fixed timing of TMS52xx OLDP and OLDE updates to happen on the correct IP/PC cycles, should very slightly improve sound/reduce clicking for TMS5200 and TMS5220 games [Lord Nightmare] (missing from whatsnew).
- 0.138u3            : TMS52xx now uses proper IP/PC/Subcycle counting for audio generation [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.138u1            : Couriersud added a readyq callback to the TMS5220 interface. This is needed to solve the missing speech bug in the Zaccaria games. The INTQ and READYQ are connected to PIA 6821 lines CA2 and CB1 which are edge driven. Just reading READYQ would miss to detect a state change if between reads READYQ went 0-1-0. Updated zaccaria.c and looping.c.
- 0.138              : Lord Nightmare removed unnecessary interpolation code in TMS5220. Added 'Unrealistically Perfect Interpolation' debug mode. Fixed a potential issue with 16 bit overflow in the lattice filter. Made idle state emulation more accurate to real chip. Clean out variables before VSM speech starts. Mask out low 4 bits of 14 bit lattice result before output. Fixed a mistake in the interpolation logic, it should now properly delay interpolation until the final cycle of each frame when INHIBIT is set. Added extra check to make unvoiced mode trigger at the correct sample. Fixed up TMS52xx clip/wrap function arrangement to be much more sane, and properly handled range extension. Made TMS5220 DEBUG_GENERATION more useful and simplified the code in the process.
- 0.137u4            : Lord Nightmare replaced TMS5220 table with table extracted using PROMOUT from actual chip. By 'Replaced', I mean documented, as the actual extracted table exactly matched the table already in MAME. Changed TMS5220C to use the same energy table as 5220 does, since my previous assumption based on the Quadravox tables was probably wrong. Updated the ranout condition code of tms5220.c to be slightly more accurate to the chip, and added TODOs. Re-enabled the timers for deactivating the READY line on /WS or /RS as this is probably slightly more accurate to hardware, but the difference is 2 or 3 clock cycles max. Made /READY timing accurate to the real chip as best as possible. Note that on the zaccaria games, possibly due to a bug in the CA2 line handler of the PIA which reads the /READY state, speech usually won't work until midway through the first game played, but works fine afterward. Not sure if that's a MAME bug or an original game bug. Fixed race condition involving TMS52xx status register which broke victory/victorba self test. Updated debug routines a bit, and improved the non-NORMALMODE a bit. Fixed ZPAR (zeroed k parameters 5-10) behavior for unvoiced frames. Updated comments and debug functions. Cleaned up ranout (FIFO running out mid-frame) to be accurate to hardware. Cleaned up talk status clearing to be more accurate to hardware. Cleaned up parse_frame function significantly. Added some more comments. Redid parameter interpolation and frame load logic so new frames don't immediately force all the Energy/Pitch/K values to the values of the old frame, but wait until their first interpolation to do so. This fix improves speech quality considerably.
- 0.137u3            : Lord Nightmare massive merge of TMS5110 and TMS5220 cores, TMS5220 side only so far. Much code by Jarek Burczynski merged. Lattice Filter, Multiplier and clipping redone. TMS5220C multi-rate feature added. Now using the same LPC table file (and format, as created by Couriersud) as the TMS51xx is. Unvoiced-Voiced transitioning adjusted to match patent. Command handling redone to better match patent. Reasonably significant speech quality improvements: Separate tables for TMS5200, TMS5220 and TMS5220C are implemented, though all still need to be verified from hardware. Fixes: Garbled speech in Escape from the Planet of the Robot Monster's Canal Mazes is fixed, as well as some other garbled speech in game (when saying 'throwing switch' for instance). Tentative fix for TMS5220 VSM support. Converted Atari System 1 to use the 'new' TMS5220 interface. Switched Escape from the Planet of the Robot Monsters to use the new TMS5220 interface. Converted Atari System 2 to use the 'new' TMS5220 interface. Switched TMS5220 type to 5220C. Updated Star Wars to use proper clocks for the TMS5220 and the Pokey's.
- 0.134u1            : Implemented a RS and WS line interface for TMS5220 [Couriersud]: This emulates the RS/WS and READY handshaking according to the TMS5220 manual. Drivers reading the ready line should most probably use it. Note: For cases where the READY handshake is done by the cpu sufficient cycles have to be burnt to simulate that the cpu waited. This yet has to be implemented. Changed all TMS5220 lines to (READ|WRITE)_LINE_DEVICE_HANDLER [Couriersud]: Added q suffix to denote active low lines. Updated all drivers accordingly. Removed some trampoline functions. Added TMS5220C variant to tms5220.c [Lord Nightmare]: Implemented reset for TMS5220C if /RS and /WS are pulled down together. Inserted LNs email and corrections as comment into source. Created a TODO section.
- 0.133u3            : Removed sound\5220intf.c/h. Aaron Giles merged 5220intf into TMS5220.
- 0.129u2            : Phil Bennett and Jay Gallagher fixed TMS5220 speech in Turbo Sub.
- 0.125u5            : Additional documentation in the TMS5220 core [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.125u2            : Lord Nightmare added proper interpolation sub-cycles to the TMS5110 and TMS5220 ('PC' cycles and A/B subcycles of each) and updated comments.
- 0.125u1            : Lord Nightmare updated TMS5200/5220 documentation and comments. Fixed the chirp table implementation in both the 51xx and 52xx chips.
- 0.123u2            : Atari Ace added some missing #if's to 5220intf.c.
- 0.122u6            : Zsolt Vasvari disabled code in the TMS5220 that set the Buffer Empty flag after a stop frame. This fixes Victory. This might be the incorrect fix but the old code wasn't working either.
- 0.118u6            : Lord Nightmare updated TMS5220 core to use shifts instead of divides for the parameter interpolation. Also added support for internal clamping to 8-bit output when using the internal DAC.
- 0.118u2            : Further improvements to the TMS5220 emulation and more unification with the TMS5110 core [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.118              : Modularized the TMS5220 code [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.111u5            : Lord Nightmare fixed PRNG noise in the TMS5110/5220 code and added signal wrapping to match the patent.
- 0.111u2            : Lord Nightmare added missing initialization to the TMS5220 RNG.
- 0.111u1            : Lord Nightmare fixed a problem with the chirp tables of both the TMS5220 and the TMS5110. Also backported Jarek's PRNG implementation from tms5110.c to tms5220.c so it no longer relies on rand().
- 0.109u2            : Connected TMS5220 speech support to the Major Havoc: Return to Vax mod [Jess Askey].
- 0.103u4            : Aaron Giles added stream_set_sample_rate() call and converted the TMS5220 sound core to output at their native sample rates, allowing the core sound system to perform over/re-sampling to the output rate.
- 0.100u4            : Aaron Giles added save state support to the TMS5220 chip.
- 0.93u1             : Aaron Giles adding missing memset when initializing the TMS5110 and TMS5220 structures; should prevent the crashes.
- 0.80               : Nathan Woods added a security margin in the estimate of the delay for TMS5220 speech synthesis ready line to come low (needed for a MESS side bug fix).
- 12th February  2003: Nathan Woods added support for TMS5220 speech ROM, though this feature is not used by any arcade game emulated so far.
- 0.37b6             : Changed name 'TMS5520' to 'TMS5220'.
- 14th February  2000: Aaron Giles modified TMS5220 and ADPCM sound cores to produce sound streams at correct sample rates.
- 11th July      1999: Raphael Nabet sent in a new version of TMS5220 emulator with support for speech rom. Phil Stroffolino sent in an update to the sprite manager.
- 0.30               : Added sndhrdw\tms5220.c/h, tms5220r.c, 5220intf.c/h and tms5220.txt. TI TMS5220 emulator [Frank Palazzolo]. This handles speech in Star Wars and other games. Aaron Giles added speech in Discs of Tron.
- NOTES: The TI TMS5220 Speech chip uses Linear-Predictive decoding scheme to produce speech from very compact data. It is virtually identical to the chip used in the landmark "Speak 'N Spell" toy produced in the '70s. This scheme is very similar to the U.S. Federal Standard LPC-10e coding system, which was developed soon after this chip. The TI speech chip contains a 128-bit parallel-in, serial-out FIFO, a 10-pole digital lattice filter which models the vocal tract, and a D/A converter. It was originally design to operate either with a microcomputer interface, or with a serial speech ROM. The Speech ROM functionality is now emulated, although no arcade games require it currently. The input data is writen a byte at a time into the chip, and it is decoded bitwise into variable length frames.

- 0.148u3            : Removed sound\tms5220r.c. Added correct TMS5200 chirp rom derived from decap; This is now used for 5200, 5220 and 5220c pending decaps of the latter two. Removed tms5220r.c which hasn't actually been compiled/used by speech code for around 2 years now, and fixed the makefile [digshadow, Sarayan, Lord Nightmare]. TMS5100 and 5200 series: Document the decapping and verification of chirp tables for the tms5100, tms5200, tms5220, and tms5220c. The LPC tables are not verified yet [digshadow, Lord Nightmare]. Based on decap analysis, both the TMS5220 and TMS5220C use identical LPC tables; get rid of the unnecessary extra table [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.142u5            : Minor updates to the TMS52xx comments and the disabled-by-default pulse excitation code to better match how hardware would probably work [Lord Nightmare, Neill Corlett].
- 0.141u3            : Lord Nightmare fixed the interpolation coefficient shifts for the TMS5xxx chips based on results of simulating the circuit from the patent.
- 0.138              : More cleanup of the LPC tables [Lord Nightmare]: Replaced TMS5220C pitch table with the TMS5220 one as that one is more likely to be correct. Fixed up TMS52xx clip/wrap function arrangement to be much more sane, and properly handled range extension.
- 0.137u4            : Lord Nightmare replaced TMS5220 table with table extracted using PROMOUT from actual chip. By 'Replaced', I mean documented, as the actual extracted table exactly matched the table already in MAME. Changed TMS5220C to use the same energy table as 5220 does, since my previous assumption based on the Quadravox tables was probably wrong. Updated the ranout condition code of tms5220.c to be slightly more accurate to the chip, and added TODOs. Re-enabled the timers for deactivating the READY line on /WS or /RS as this is probably slightly more accurate to hardware, but the difference is 2 or 3 clock cycles max.
- 0.137u3            : Lord Nightmare fixed 5220C pitch table so unvoiced speech actually works. Oops. Should be a further quality improvement. Cleaned up interpolation inhibit logic, may sound slightly better now. Minor fix to TMS5220C table so zero-energy frames are correctly detected. Converted Atari System 2 to use the 'new' TMS5220 interface. Switched TMS5220 type to 5220C.
- 0.137u2            : Replaced TMS5220 sound with TMS5220C in eprom.
- 0.134u1            : Implemented a RS and WS line interface for TMS5220 [Couriersud]: This emulates the RS/WS and READY handshaking according to the TMS5220 manual. Drivers reading the ready line should most probably use it. Note: For cases where the READY handshake is done by the cpu sufficient cycles have to be burnt to simulate that the cpu waited. This yet has to be implemented. Changed all TMS5220 lines to (READ|WRITE)_LINE_DEVICE_HANDLER [Couriersud]: Added q suffix to denote active low lines. Updated all drivers accordingly. Removed some trampoline functions. Added TMS5220C variant to tms5220.c [Lord Nightmare]: Implemented reset for TMS5220C if /RS and /WS are pulled down together. Inserted LNs email and corrections as comment into source. Created a TODO section.

- NOTES: This is an emulator for "typical" speech ROMs from TI, as used by TI99/4(a). In order to support its speech processor, TI designed some ROMs with a 1-bit data bus and 4-bit address bus (multiplexed 5 times to provide a 18-bit address). A fairly complete description of such a ROM (tms6100) is found in the tms5220 datasheet.

- 0.122u2            : Removed sound\m58817.c/h. Added coefficient maps for TMS5100 and M58817 from documented sources to tms5110r.c [Couriersud].
- 0.122              : Added sound\m58817.c/h. Couriersud wrote M58817 sound driver and hooked it up to Radar Scope (TRS01). Uses TMS5110 speech synthesis. LPC format is identical, however coefficients seem to be different. Until coefficients are known, samples are used.
- 0.116u3            : DKong driver update [Couriersud]: First attempts on decoding m58815.
- NOTES: Mitsubishi M58817AP Speech Generator - Speech Synthesizer; DIP28. MAME: The Mitsubishi M58817 seems to have (partly?) copied the coefficients from the TMC0280/CD2801 above, but has some slight differences to it within the chip: The main accumulator seems to have 1 extra bit and the digital values are tapped 1 bit higher than on the TI chips.

S26.4   Votrax SC-01

- 0.181              : Simulate Votrax SC-01 (gorf, qbert, qbertqub, reactor, sqbert, tylz and wow). Complete simulation of digital section based on die imaging. Plosives are still imperfect [O. Galibert].
- 0.167              : Fixed the memory map mirroring based on schematic in (MESS) Votrax Type 'N Talk [Lord Nightmare, Kevtris].
- 0.153              : Converted Votrax SC-01 device to DEVCB2 [Osso].
- 0.151              : Changed speech clock to value recommended on the datasheet for (MESS) Votrax Type 'N Talk and Personal Speech System [Robbbert].
- 0.149              : Connected ACIA and RS232 in in (MESS) Votrax Type 'N Talk [Robbbert].
- 0.145u6            : Votrax clock adjustment [Aaron Giles].
- 0.145u4            : Formalized the Votrax SC-01 device [Aaron Giles, Lord Nightmare, Olivier Galibert]. Implemented the full set of digital logic from the patent, including the timing circuit, transition circuit, glottal generator, and noise source. Some unknowns still exist with regards to clocking, due to contradictory statements in the patent, but as it stands now, all parameters are fetched and processed, phonemes are requested, and in theory all that remains is for someone with analog sound experience to simulate the filters on the output. For now, you just get the raw glottal pulse mixed with the noise signal based on the vocal and fricative amplitudes, which is enough to show progress, but hardly a pleasing result just yet. Aaron Giles converted Gottlieb r1 and r2 sound boards into full-on devices, using the recently-added mixer interface. All sound outputs are redirected to the new sound device itself, and then the consuming driver can route the new sound device's outputs as appropriate. The Votrax chip has been hooked up properly, with a crude guess at the variable clocking. Current Votrax emulation is turned off, but it can be enabled by changing USE_FAKE_VOTRAX to 0 in gottlieb.h. A few tweaks, better logging [Aaron Giles]. Added some temporary hacks to the votrax to get the parameters to all change to real values so the analog filters can be tested. Changed USE_FAKE_VOTRAX back to 1. Was accidentally checked in the wrong way in a previous change [Aaron Giles]. Added analog path to Votrax (Compute Final Capacity + Analog to Digital Filter) [O. Galibert].
- 0.120u3            : Some build-related improvements to the sound cores [Atari Ace]: VOTRAX can now be built independentally of SAMPLES.
- 0.129              : Added sound\votrax.h.
- 0.93               : Aaron Giles pulled out the dead Votrax core (was still being hard-compiled) and made it a proper sound type (which currently isn't included).
- 0.34b4             : Kevin Bales improved speech in Gorf. It now plays speech 100% accurately except for the missing samples.
- 0.31               : Alex Judd made better speech in Gorf.
- 0.28               : Added sndhrdw\votrax.c.
- NOTES: Votrax SC-01 synthesizer uses 64 phoneme to produce speech. The PinMAME uses all original 64 phonemes (http://www.pinmame.com/ + http://pinmame.retrogames.com/).
- GAMES: Gottlieb games uses the Votrax speech chip in the revision 1 sound board (Q*bert and Reactor). The revision 2 games uses a GI SP-0250 speech chip.

S26.5   S14001A

- 0.186              : Changed name 'S14001A' to 'SSi TSI S14001A'.
- 0.170              : Added optional devcb callbacks for mem read and BSY pin. Set default amp to 15 [hap]. Added more accurate SSi S14001A speech chip emulation, written by one of the people at SSi who originally laid out the S14001a silicon in 1974/5! (http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/speech-.html) [Ed Bernard, hap]. Added savestates to new s14001a_device. Added new s14001a_device to to Berzerk, Frenzy, Moon War, Wolf Pack and st_mp200.cpp (catacomp, flight2k, freefall, lightnin, orbitor1 and spltsecp) [hap].
- 0.162              : Added save state support to S14001A sound [Osso].
- 0.150              : Modernized the S14001A sound device [Osso].
- 0.148u2            : Added note that the four S14001A DAC test pins are really digital out pins [PlgDavid].
- 0.136u2            : Lord Nightmare updated S14001A comments; got rid of the squealing noise (hidden behind a #define now, code is still there) until some other issues can be resolved.
- 0.128u4            : Update S14001A core [Lord Nightmare]: Added chip pinout and operation notes.
- 0.125u9            : Update S14001A core [Lord Nightmare]: Improved filtering to be more accurate to the chip, changed internal audio renderer to produce 4 bit sound as the real chip does. Moved filter outside of the main rendering loop into the glue code. Note: With this update, you may hear a whining noise that was not previously present. This is accurate to the chip! The real chip would almost always have an analog filter placed on its output to suppress this whine.
- 0.122u7            : Zsolt Vasvari changed S14001A emulator to allow setting the clock frequency instead of the clock multiplier. This is how the real chip works. Changed the Berzerk driver to set the S14001A clock as per the schematics.
- 0.117u2            : Lord Nightmare connected S14001A speech to the Wolf Pack driver.
- 0.111u6            : Lord Nightmare added the missing volume and frequency controls to the Berzerk driver and s14001a core. Fixed the issue with random words being spoken instead of the proper ones. Word is now latched at the proper time.
- 0.111u5            : Lord Nightmare fixed a minor problem with sound clipping in the s14001a.
- 0.111u4            : Added sound\s14001a.c/h. Preliminary emulation of the TSI S14001A speech synthesizer as found in Berzerk/Frenzy (and also Stern pinballs) [Lord Nightmare, Kevtris, R. Belmont].
- NOTES: TSI S14001A emulator by Jonathan Gevaryahu ("Lord Nightmare") with help from Kevin Horton ("kevtris"). MAME conversion and integration by R. Belmont. The TSI S14001A speech chip produced speech with speech roms from the VSU-1000 board. Berzerk, Universal Research Laboratories/Stern Inc., 1980. Just passing a Berzerk machine was a new experience for most people. The machine actually spoke! Few people had experienced voice-synthesis at the time, and it made quite an impression. Because digitization was so expensive, the sentences spoken by Berzerk shared a vocabulary of only 30 words. The speech was done using LPC coding that I believe was invented by T.I., although I remember we used a National Speech chip in it. This was when speech and memory was expensive, so we didn't just digitize sounds and dump them out through a DAC. I remember it cost something like $1000 per word to have the compression done, so we tried to come up with a limited vocabulary which could be rearranged and reused as much as possible. There was some guy up in Silicon Gulch who did this stuff for a living - so it is possible to make money while talking in a monotone.

- 0.129              : Aaron Giles added polling hooks for SP0250 DRQ line. The callback is now optional. If not provided, then the kick timer is not used. Converted gottlieb speech driver to use polling for SP0250 DRQ line.
- 0.102u5            : SP0250 update [Nicola Salmoria]: Added SP0250 speech chip to The Three Stooges. Streamlined the SP0250 emulation to avoid timing issues which were preventing 3 stooges from working. Fixed glitches in the speech that were caused by not resetting the filter stages when a speech frame is loaded. Made the SP0250 support the external clock rate. Changed the playback rate to match the real board by making the clock divider a reasonable number.
- 0.93               : Changed name 'GI_SP0250' to 'SP0250'.

- 0.149u1            : Modernized the VLM5030 speech synthesizer chip [Osso].
- 0.143u8            : Added tables from VLM5030 as verified by decap from ogoun. Adapted VLM5030 to use the TMS5xxx common tables file. Some details have yet to be worked out for certain (how exactly the reflection coefficients beyond k=2 address the k2+ rom) [ogoun, Lord Nightmare, The Dumping Union]. Adjusted the VLM5030 K3 thru K10 coefficients to be based not on reading the K2 rom but based on the index itself <<6 or 7. This makes the games sound much better and explains the very small ram size used for coefficients other than K1 and K2. This needs further investigation and figuring out of the die schematic to settle completely [Lord Nightmare].
-  7th October   2010: Smitdogg - Ogoun decapped the VLM5030 sound chip used in games like Double Dribble. Thanks to Corrado Tomaselli for donating the chip.
- 0.139u2            : Lord Nightmare added IC pinout to VLM5030 driver. Still need translation of the datasheet for VCU, RST (which does more than just reset) and MTE.

- 23rd January   2002: Tatsuyuki Satoh added the 4800/9600bps parameter support to the VLM5030 sound chip emulation, fixing some speech in Jailbreak.
- 22nd January   2002: Tatsuyuki Satoh fixed the noise generator in the VLM5030 sound chip emulation, completely removing the need for samples.
- 21st January   2002: Tatsuyuki Satoh submitted a new, much improved version of the VLM5030 sound chip emulation, used for speech in (Super) Punch-Out and a few other drivers. It is now more than 90% accurate to the original, and only a few small problems remain.
- 23rd July      2001: Tatsuyuki Satoh adjusted the speed parameter in the VLM5030 emulation.
- 19th July      2001: Tatsuyuki Satoh improved the filter parameter in VLM5030 emulation but it is still not perfect.
- 0.37b14            : Tatsuyuki Satoh improved speech in Double Dribble.

- NOTES: The UPD7759 is a speech processing LSI that utilizes ADPCM to produce speech or other sampled sounds. It can directly address up to 1Mbit (128k) of external data ROM, or the host CPU can control the speech data transfer. The UPD7759 is usually hooked up to a 640 kHz clock and has one 8-bit input port, a start pin, a busy pin, and a clock output. The ADPCM converter converts nibbles into 9-bit DAC values. It has an internal state of 4 bits that's used in conjunction with the nibble to lookup which of the 256 possible steps is used. Then the state is changed according to the nibble value. Essentially, the higher the state, the bigger the steps are, and using big steps increase the state. Conversely, using small steps reduces the state. This allows the engine to be a little more adaptative than a classical ADPCM algorithm. The UPD7759 can run in two modes, master (also known as standalone) and slave. The mode is selected through the "md" pin. No known game changes modes on the fly, and it's unsure if that's even possible to do.

S28.2   CD Audio

- 0.187              : Improved CD audio play track/index command handling (machine\mb89352.cpp and t10mmc.cpp). kokoroj2 needs mods in the MB89352 core that won't break (MESS) Sharp X68000 as well. kokoroj2 requires the printer interface, a command to stop current track is sent with CD & printer disabled in dipswitches [smf].
- 0.180              : Removed CD-DA volume trampolines [smf].
- 0.179              : Removed machine\matsucd.cpp/h. m_audio_ended_normally is set within the stream_update(), so update the stream before returning it (sound\cdda.cpp) [smf].
- 0.166              : Added 3rdparty\libflac\include\share\endswap.h. Backport libflac endian patch to not use winsock.h etc [Balrog].
- 0.157              : Moved lib\libflac\*.* to lib\libflac\libFLAC\. Moved some FLAC files around to match the distribution package structure [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.154              : Fixed usage of uninitialized member in lc89510_temp_device (machine\megacdcd.c) [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.148u5            : Modernised CDDA & discard buffered samples when starting to play to avoid audio glitches and timing issues (sound\cdda.c/h, emu\machine\matsucd.c, scsicd.c/h, stvcd.c, mame\machine\cd32.c, cdicdic.c, gdrom.c/h and megacdcd.c) [smf].
- 0.148              : Added cdda_get_channel_volume() function to CD-DA device. Fixed volume control display in PC Engine CD system [Angelo Salese].
- 0.145u2            : Better management of FLAC block sizes, aiming to keep them around 2k samples. Increased CD sectors per hunk to 8 for better compression [David Haywood].
- 0.145u1            : Added new CHD codec [Aaron Giles]: CD-FLAC which knows how to shuffle CD data to more optimally use FLAC. Updated flac wrapper to implement a tell callback so FLAC can tell us how much we've decoded. Updated chdman to use CD-FLAC codec in preference over the existing codecs for CDs by default. Fail initializing the CD-FLAC codec if the hunk size is not CD-compatible. Centralize detection of existing output files. Add detection (require --force) for extracted files as well. Move checks outside of try/catch so that the files are not subsequently deleted. Rewrote SAMPLES as a modern device [Aaron Giles]. Updated all callers. FLAC reading is now done using the FLAC wrapper. There is now a samples_iterator class to centralize the logic for handling the sample list walking. Also redid the cheesy half-baked votrax device since it relied on some old samples-based handling. Until we have a real implementation, it would be good to route the various clients through the current one to at least wire it up properly, even if it just plays samples in the end. Will look into that shortly.
- 0.145              : Various wav/flac sample changes [David Haywood]: Remove hardcoded ".wav" sample extensions from within drivers. Update samples.c to check for both .flac and .wav extensions when loading a sample. Made sample loading failure a bit more verbose (various zips contained 0 byte samples, I assume to keep clrmame happy or something). Fixed memory allocation with 8-bit flac samples. WAV is not (yet) deprecated, rm warning that made it sound like it is [hap]. David Haywood fixed -verifysamples.
- 0.144u7            : Added FLAC (lossless audio) codec support plus experimental hooks in samples and chdman. Bumped up CHD-CD hunk size to get better compression ratios on both zlib and flac [David Haywood, R. Belmont]. Changed the way FLAC compiles so that it works like other external libraries, and also compiles successfully for MSVC builds [Aaron Giles]. Disable -createcdflac for now. The CHDs produced are not compatible with existing v4 CHD readers, so I don't want these out in the wild. We will need a version bump to add this support properly. I'll tackle this next (after fixing recent regressions). Changed the way FLAC compiles so that it works like other external libraries, and also compiles successfully for MSVC builds [Aaron Giles].
- 18th January   2012: David Haywood - One of the criticisms often made of MAME / MESS's CHD format is that it doesn't actually provide very efficient compression, especially when it comes to CD AUDIO data. I've had a number of people ask me if I can look into improving this, especially when you consider that in with the current format a complete Saturn set is almost 1TB, with a large portion of that being AUDIO. The reason it's inefficient is because it's using zlib's inflate algorithm for the blocks, blocks which are rather small to ensure that data is decompressed quickly. While this is fine for DATA (it's the same thing that ZIP files use) it's absolutely hopeless for AUDIO. There are dedicated audio lossless compressors out there, FLAC is a popular one. I've spent the last 4-5 days solid integrating support for this into the MAME / MESS tree, and extending the CHD format to not only support it's native blocks (hunks), but also reference to embedded streams via 'virtual hunks' which point at a stream, and allow the actual FLAC codec to do the seeking and decoding work for this. By doing this I can achieve a good level of compression with FLAC, far better than trying to split it into CHD hunks due to the lower overhead, and improved ability of the compression algorithms to predict how data best compresses. I also still get good speed decoding, as the FLAC format is designed to be quick to seek, and has built in seektable support of it's own which I'm levering. I have to say FLAC is an absolute joy to work with, the API does everything you can expect, the documentation is great, and it's very good at letting you know if something is wrong. (the only issue I had with the documentation / API was with the seektables, whereby calling things in the wrong order / wrong time during encoding could cause data to be overwritten without throwing an error). I've also added support to the MAME SAMPLE interface to playback files from FLAC sources, this should allow the recently dumped tape loops to be compressed much better than they are now (they're uncompressed PCM .wav files). The other possibilities for this are endless, -wavwrite could also output FLAC data if support was added, MESS could potentially load cassette based software from FLAC images. It's an incredibly useful codec to have around. I've uploaded my first pass of this code Here (link offline for the time being, there is definitely still an error). This should be considered ALPHA SOFTWARE and I won't be held responsible if you end up destroying your CHDs with it. I'm currently in the process of batch converting many images and haven't found a broken case yet, but still, it's in testing. While I'm happy with the current format extensions and CHD format created it could change in a final version, you have been warned. This code has been submitted to R. Belmont, who is currently making some portability fixes. FLAC is designed to be portable, so this shouldn't be too much of a problem, so fingers crossed it can be sorted out soon. Usage is simple, I've added an additional -createcdflac commandline option which will use the FLAC routines when compressing AUDIO. If you already know how to use CHDMAN then it's simple enough. I've added support to the MAME SAMPLE interface to playback files from FLAC sources, this should allow the recently dumped tape loops to be compressed much better than they are now (they're uncompressed PCM .wav files).
- 0.139u3            : Angelo Salese added a set volume function for CD-DA.
- 0.130u1            : Modified cdrom.c to expose metadata read/write functions, and changed chdman to use them.
- 0.112u3            : smf added state saving to emu\sound\cdda.c.
- 0.110u3            : Aaron Giles cleaned up cdrom.c. Removed audio implementation and relocated code into sound\cdda.c.
- 0.93               : Changed name 'CD_Audio' to 'CD/DA'.
- 0.80u3             : Added sound\cdda.c/h. R. Belmont added Preliminary CD-ROM support for CHDMAN. CDROM emulation primitives, including Red Book audio playback. Audio tracks on CDs are not compressed on a CD image at present (or more accurately they're gzip compressed, which is useless). The plan is to use FLAC at some point.
- 15th January   2004: R. Belmont - CD audio tracks now work for CHD-CDs, so Susume! Taisen Puzzle-Dama has background music.

P0.    The Decapping Project

-  8th January   2011: Smitdogg - We've sent more chips to the doc for decapping and I got a scanner so I should have a bunch of scans on the artwork board soon.
- 26th December  2010: Dr. Decapitator - Work has begun on the following chips from The Decapping Project Status Page: #13, #17, #20, #21, #22, #23, #38, #51, #88, #89, #107, #109, #114, #123, #124, #125, #134, #200 and #201. More info to come later... The remaining 68705's are on hold at the moment because they were damaged and require special parts to fix which haven't yet been acquired.
- 27th June      2010: Guru - We've successfully decapped more than 25% of the chips that have been sent to the lab. See my Decapping Status page for more info and the list of other wanted items. If you can help to donate funds towards future decapping please visit Dr. Decapitator's Laboratory. Thanks!
- 0.131u2            : Angelo Salese added notes to several drivers indicating specifically that an MCU is needed for decapping.
- 30th July      2008: Guru - Thanks to Dox who sent a few more chips to be decapped. These chips are from Taiwan Chess Legend, Elvis, Kyros, Cow Race, D-Day, Double Dealer, Raiden II, Angel Eyes, Arkanoid, Croupier and Heavy Barrel.
- 11th June      2008: Guru - Speaking of decapping, I've just about got it all together, sort-of. I've just completed a BIG _preliminary_ update with everything that I've sorted out so far.... at least until I find more things to add to the list! There's so much stuff here that I keep finding things to decap(!?!). There's some minor work involved removing the chips and some serious work involved keeping track of everything and updating the decapping page (plus, remember I work full-time....) so there's still a few weeks/months before it will all go out. I'm also planning to add pics of every chip. In the meantime probably more stuff will arrive! There's at least a couple more wanted chips coming from Japan in the next big box that will arrive in 3-4 weeks and some other devs are going to send out some more chips soon. You might notice a lot of chips that are unknown and may or may not be important. I've decided to just grab everything that _could_ be useful for emulation purposes and send it out and see what happens. There's no guarantees that any of it will be successful, but we must try. Will collecting the decapping chips ever end?
- 27th February  2008: Guru - I've struck a deal with a company that does IC security work to process most, if not all of the micro-controllers that I'm currently holding. This includes the following chips and possibly more that may come my way in the near future: BSMT2000, All remaining Namco custom MCUs (i.e. 59xx, 62xx etc), NMK004, Sega Model 1 TGPs, Namco customs C70, C75 & C76, Sound MCUs from Vimana and Teki Paki, QSound chips from Capcom ZN1 and CPS1/2), Kaneko Beast (DJ Boy, B Rap Boys), Kaneko Mermaid (Heavy Unit), C-Chip from Bonze Adventure, Sound MCUs from Fix Eight and Knuckle Bash, MCU's from Victorious Nine, Xain'd Sleena/Solar Warrior, Alcon, Prebillian, Tokio and possibly others that I can find, MCU's from Joshi Volleyball, Meikyuu Hunter G, Super Qix, Gladiators, Tatakae! Big Fighter and possibly others, Every PIC16C621A that I have here (maybe 20, used by GDROM-based games), Sound MCU from Dynamic Shoot & Moero Proyakyuu Home Run, MCU from Kyuukyoku Tiger, MCUs from NBA Jam Extreme and Primal Rage II, MCU from NAOMI/Hikaru/HNG64 JVS I/O board and probably two or three other chips from a few MAMEdevs. There will also be the possiblity of a few others including Gaelco's suicidal DS5002 from World Rally at a later date in a separate analysis project. This is a special Guru-deal with some conditions. To get this work done by a professional company would cost about $80k-$100k. This includes decapping and micro-photographing of maskROM and decapping plus UV-zapping of protection bits and readout of internal EPROM. We can wait for an unknown period of time for one or two other people to try their attempts at about 10% of these with no guarantee of success. Make no mistake, most of these are beyond even the above average set-up. We're talking BIG dollars to process most of these chips. Or we accept the special Guru-deal and get it all for $7500. That's an amazing price when you consider to process one PIC16C621A costs $1200 per chip! On top of that, this company is also MAME-friendly and supports our cause.... one of the reasons why we're getting such a cheap price. Oh and they were influenced by my Guru-Charm, of course. They are also able to extract the ROM directly from the IC substrate so in some cases high-magnification of the die and tedious bit-analysis may not even be required..... they can suck the bits right off the chip directly! Of course, there's a problem. There's always a problem! I can cover $2500 of that, but to move forward I need to come up with the rest of the bucks. I'm hoping for assistance from out there in internet-land. As I said, this could be the most important day in emulation history providing the funds can be achieved. If you can help, simply click the Paypal Donation button to the right. Thanks!
- 27th March     2007: Guru - Here's the next chip we've decapped in a little more detail (Namco 50XX). This shows the full chip die at approx 20X magnification (reduced to minimise the file size, the real image is 5X bigger) and is roughly pasted together from 6 separate images for your viewing pleasure.
- 10th March     2007: Guru - I've been thinking about how to defeat the protected MCU's that use EPROM. My theory is to unlock the chip by exposing only the protection fuse to UV light, which should then allow the chip to be read as an unprotected MCU (for example 68705P5's on many early Taito games, and Intel 8751 MCU's used on Sega S16/S18 and others). Of course, there is a catch. It requires a high quality microscope that can be connected to a PC. There is such a device available. In fact many models are available on eBay from a retail seller. Not cheap though! This one is probably the minimum required. It can magnify up to 90X and has a 3.3MP CCD camera. Those camera/mag. specs are the same as the pics I got from the Japanese lab which were used to successfully re-create the code from the Namco 54xx MCU. We'll still need the Japanese lab for decapping and photographing maskROM-based MCUs, but this type of thing can't really be done by someone else, it needs a hands-on approach and lots of time. This method just might work well enough to allow reading the chip in it's unprotected form. According to MCU protection specialists (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/tamper/), the method I have described is one of the well known methods used to defeat EPROM-based MCUs. We could do the same, given the equipment. The only problem now is lack of funds.
-  5th February  2006: With the successful 'decap dumping' of the MCU from Bubble Bobble, it got us (MAMEDev) thinking if we could do this with a few more chips. Thus the 'Decapping Project' was born.

P1.1   ALPHA-8201

- 0.179              : Fixed disassembly window. Sync pc & curpc [smf]. Changed the Alpha 8x01 disassembler to use std::ostream internally (cpu\alph8201\8201dasm.cpp) [Nathan Woods].
- 0.168              : Added machine\alpha8201.c/h. Renamed device to prevent name clash during modernization (L is for Legacy). Added ALPHA-8201 protection emulation and hooked it up to shougi.c [hap].
- 0.149u1            : Modernized ALPHA-8x01 cpu cores [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.128u6            : Pointer-ified the ALPHA-8201 CPU core [Aaron Giles].
- 0.125u7            : Atari Ace fixed a few build problems with the ALPHA8201 CPU core.
- 0.123u6            : Alpha Denshi major update [Nicola Salmoria]: Fixed Alpha 8201/830x MCU simulation. All hacks from the equites driver removed. Fixed equites restart position after going underground. Fixed hvolume, splndrbt 2 players. Removed hacks from exctsccr2. Fixed CPU gameplay in shougi. Added dump of Alpha 8201 MCU to games that use it (the ROM isn't used yet, HMCS44 CPU core needs to be written first).
- 0.109u5            : Aaron Giles converted the alph8201 disassemblers to the new format and added step in/out support where it was obvious.
- 0.104u8            : Added cpu\alph8201\alph8201.c/h and 8201dasm.c. Tatsuyuki Satoh added emulation of the Alpha 8201/8301 MCU, and connected it to champbbj, champbb2, talbot, shougi, shougi2 and exctsccr.
- NOTES: The Alpha-8201/830x isn't a real CPU. It is a Hitachi HD44801 4-bit MCU, programmed to interpret an external program using a custom instruction set. Shougi (Alpha 198x) use a custom MCU ALPHA 8201 (DIP42). It's connected to the RAM that is shared with the first CPU.
- DRIVERS: champbas.cpp, equites.cpp and shougi.cpp

P1.3   8302

- 0.126u5            : Nicola Salmoria updated Alpha 8302 MCU simulation to match newly dumped internal ROM. Added the ROM to Champion Baseball 2.
- 12th September 2004: Pierpaolo Prazzoli added Exciting Soccer II protection (still at least one issue because you can't control the player).
- NOTES: The main purpose of the MCU is to control the program flow. This tables are actually subroutine addresses, wich get pushed onto the stack one after the other. Basically then the program runs and when it returns on one of these subroutines, it expects to land on the proper 'next' subroutine. All tables built manually from the analisis of the bootleg set.

P2.    Atari

P2.1   Slapstik

- 0.175              : Removed the slapstic direct update handler, which hasn't been necessary since direct access has been enhanced to work correctly on handlers, years ago (machine\atarigen.cpp) [O. Galibert].
- 0.171              : One small step toward slapstic modernization. Make chip number part of device configuration, not init param. Correct mainpcb slapstic number in racedrivpan. Removed many unused slapstics. Hopefully no regressions [AJR].
- 0.156              : Get rid of some global stuff by making Atari Slapstic a device [David Haywood].
- 0.123u5            : Aaron Giles changed slapstic management to always install an opbase handler to more aggressively catch code executing in the slapstic region. Updated all drivers to separate the slapstic region of ROM into a different ROM section from the fixed ROM.
- 0.122u4            : Atari updates [Aaron Giles]: Added save state support to slapstic. Modified slapstic code to support address range mirrors.
- 0.96u3             : Aaron Giles simplified additive path in slapstic code. This should not impact any games that use it, but it is worth verifying (see atarisy1+2.c, atetris.c, harddriv.c and starwars.c games).
- 0.71u3             : Added some Slapstics used in Europe / Japan (machine\slapstic.c) [Aaron Giles].
- 18th September 2002: Aaron Giles fixed the remaining issues with the Rampart slapstic behaviour.
- 15th November  2001: Aaron Giles added another version of Road Blasters that uses a different Slapstic chip.
- 0.53               : Added includes\slapstic.h.
- 30th July      2001: Aaron Giles finally ironed out the last Slapstic bugs, fixing Pit Fighter and Rampart for good.
- 21st June      1999: Nicola Salmoria finally fixed Empire Strikes Back's slapstic issues, and the game itself is playable!
- 22nd June      1999: Ernesto Corvi fixed the slapstic problems in Rampart. Nicola Salmoria fixed the slapstic problems in Xybots, and fixed Empire Strikes Back from hanging at the highscore screen.
- 20th June      1999: Nicola Salmoria and Ernesto Corvi fixed the slapstic issues in Gauntlet and Gauntlet 2.
- 0.31               : Added machine\slapstic.c.
- NOTES: The slapstic was a security chip made by Atari, which was used for bank switching and security in several coin-operated video games from 1984 through 1990. The slapstic generally sits between the CPU's address bus and one of the program ROMs. The son of slapstik is a protection chip called SLOOP.
       - The slapstic chip is a socketed DIP20 on the board and the number on the chip will be 137412-1xx.

- 0.175              : Removed unneeded sloop direct update handler (drivers\atarig42.cpp) [O. Galibert].
-  6th February  2002: Aaron Giles re-submitted Zsolt Vasvari's and Jim Hernandez's Buck Rogers sample support, fixed the Blaster line fill and added the missing ASIC65 source file.
- NOTES: The SLOOP (or "SLOOPstic") is a follow-on chip to the slapstic. It provides a similar type of security, but is programmed onto a GAL6001, rather than a custom part. It was created because Atari was running out of slapstics to use in their games, and the original masks for the slapstic had been lost by the company that manufactured them. A separate FAQ for this chip is planned for the future.
       - Road Riot 4WD (1991): (Aaron Giles) The core hardware is pretty similar to Hydra, but the emulation suffers from the lack of understanding of a custom ASIC on the board. Apparently this ASIC is used for complex math operations, and improper emulation of it leads to incorrectly drawn roads and crashes. It is likely this game also uses a SLOOP (son-of-slapstik) chip for protection. The sound board is a standard Atari 6502, YM2151 and ADPCM board.
       - Guardians of the 'Hood (1992): (Aaron Giles) Runs on the same hardware as Road Riot 4WD, but seems to have a much simpler chip in place of the custom ASIC. On the other hand, it is still unplayable due to a lack of understanding of the SLOOP protection chip.
       - Space Lords (1992): (Aaron Giles) This is the first Atari game to use a 68020 processor. Other games to follow on similar hardware include Moto Frenzy, T-Mek, and Primal Rage. The video and sound hardware is quite similar to the previous games (Guardians of the Hood and Road Riot 4WD). However, the SLOOP chip appears to have gone away, only to be replaced by something equally sinister. Space Lords uses this chip to produce the palette for the sprites, which is why all the screenshots have incorrect colors. The protection chip is also used to produce some in-game parameters, making it nigh impossible to play without accurate emulation.

- 0.112u2            : Many more CPS2 keys added. Removed all XORs and support for them from MAME [Nicola Salmoria, Andreas Naive].
- 17th February  2007: Nicola Salmoria - CPS2 not much left to do: When I originally wrote the key searching program, that was on the assumption that the key for the second Feistel network was 96 bits long. Each (E,D) pair reduces the key space by a factor of about 2^16, so to isolate the correct key with good confidence one would need at least 96/16 = 6 (E,D) pairs. The big problem is finding those pairs. Remember that they must be at compatible addresses, that is addresses whose bottom 17 bits are the same. This is a serious limitation, because the code of several games only covers a range of 0x80000 bytes, which would give a maximum of 4 pairs at any address. For the Super Puzzle Fighter 2 games, the range is just 0x40000 bytes, giving just 2 pairs per address. One can find hundreds, even thousands of of (E,D) pairs, but if they are not at compatible addresses they are of no use to find the key using this attack. However, now we know that the key actually has only 64 significant bits, some of which are repeated. I therefore rewrote the program to take that into account. This means that only 4 (E,D) pairs are needed to isolate the key. Also, I made several important optimisations that I missed the first time around, like caching intermediate results and speeding up the s-boxes calculations by using precalculated tables (this last optimisation also made into MAME so the decryption when loading a game is now faster). The end result is a program that is orders of magnitude faster than the previous one. Now it takes just 15 seconds to find the key given 8 (E,D) pairs. With 5 pairs, which was just plain impossible before, it takes 5 minutes. With 4 pairs, 35 minutes. These improvement made it simple to find most of the remaining keys, even for games that didn't have a matching revision already decrypted (most notably some of the Steeet Fighter Zero versions). But there's more: the program is now fast enough to go one step further, and look for the key with just 3 pairs. Of course 3 pairs are not enough to isolate the right key: they only reduce the key space by about 2^48, therefore leaving about 2^16 keys which are compatible with the data. Once a 64-bit key for the second Feistel network is selected, the compatible 64-bit master keys can then be easily generated, and used to verify other (E,D) pairs at different addresses. This allows to find the correct key in less than one day, and I had to use this extended attack for a couple of the most problematic games. In the meantime, Andreas Naive has been busy implementing the attack he had described on his blog, and was able to find the keys for two of the Super Puzzle Fighter 2 games. Unfortunately, the attack failed on the third. Work is still in progress on that one, and there is some hope that the key will eventually be found. The only other games that are missing a key are the two CPS2 versions of Mega Man. There is no decrypted CPS2 version of that game to compare with, and the CPS1 version seems to be too different to be able to find good pairs.
- 0.111u5            : Nicola Salmoria removed XORs from almost all CPS2 games in place of proper emulation of the encryption.
- 23rd January   2007: Guru - Here's a few pics of the very first custom chip that I sent to a professional Japanese IC decapping company that we (MAMEdev) are using to help us with some MAME-related things. Hopefully if this is successful, more will follow and also hopefully talented hardware devs like JROK will be able to make replacements for it to repair real PCBs. You may also be wondering why we're doing this instead of using some other people who frequent the 'boards' who have offered to do this kind of thing for free? The answer is fairly simple.... apart from the amount of time it takes to get this done, the level of communication is somewhat 'sporadic' and so far offers to supply other chips to them have been ignored. We requested pics of some CPS2 ICs that were said to have been decapped and so far nothing has surfaced (over a month has passed since then). Doing it this way gives us more control over what we achieve and ensures the work is done in a timely manner. Apart from that, the plan to get this IC decapped has been in the works for several months, so we might as well use the professional IC decapping company whenever possible because the amount of ICs we need to decap is possibly too much work for someone to do in their spare time for free.
- 21st January   2007: Nicola Salmoria - CPS2 Key Bit Order: As previously mentioned, the 64-bit keys I'm currently using should be the same as the hardware ones, except for a fixed permutation of the bits. The permutation is actually irrelevant as far as the algorithm is concerned, since it is already taken into account when generating subkeys. The difference that it does make, however, is that there are strong suspicions that some of the keys are not random numbers, so what looks like random gibberish currently would show some order if we had the correct permutation. Take the ssf2 versions for example. There are currently 6 different versions supported: World, USA, Asia, Japan, Tournament World, Tournament Japan. Here are the keys (in a different order): 3D9E1E15A58C32CE, 3599DF35AD98284C, B74433502F4653D7, 8758E3923FFA1A50, F0AE3D08420DD6BF and 6260014FD857F7A7. There is something immediately obvious about those keys: they all contain exactly 32 0s and 32 1s. When picking one random 64-bit numbers, the likelihood of this happening is about 1 in 10, so it's ok. But the likelihood of it happening for SIX numbers is about 1 in 1 million! So we can be pretty sure that those keys are not random numbers. What is one particularly simple sequence that has exactly 32 1s? Well, of course 0123456789ABCDEF. And sure enough, after looking at the bits for a while and applying an appropriate permutation, here is what the above keys become: 0123456789ABCDEF, 1032547698BADCFE, 45673210CDEFAB89, 67451032FEDC98BA, 89ABDCEF45672301 and CDEFBA9823016754. Looks much better doesn't it? Though there's no way to tell how close it is to the real thing.
- 19th January   2007: Nicola Salmoria - CPS2 Moving Slowly Now: The improved attack works, and I've been able to recover a few more keys, but it takes a lot of computation time--several hours per game. I've also experienced some failures, e.g. I could find the key for dimahoo but not for gmahou. This might have been because of a false positive when looking for pairs with the complementation property, so now I'm trying again with a different pair. Since the searches take so long, experimenting isn't easy. On the plus side, I've applied the improved attack also to some games for which XOR files were not available, and it worked in a number of cases--though it failed in many others. One of the new versions supported is mshb, which I is the first Brazilian version of a CPS2 game to work. Andreas has published details on a theoretical attack using differential cryptanalysis which looks promising. If Andy's calculations are correct, it should allow to retrive the key for the three most problematic games: spf2t, spf2xj, and spf2ta. It does require a lot of (E,D,k) triplets, something in the order of 2^16-2^17, which is a bit steep, but we should be able to do that in a few cases. One thing to note about my attack, which I might not have explained clearly, is that it requires a remarkably small amount of data: it has worked for many games with just 7 (E,D) pairs. The problem is that those pairs must all be at the same address (as far as the encryption is concerned; that is, bits 1-16 of the address must be the same). Those 7 pairs allow to retrieve the 96-bit key for the second round at that address, and once that is known, the 64-bit master key can be found in less than 1 second, without having to know ANY other (E,D) pair at any address. Unfortunately for game like spf2t, whose full encryption range covers just 2 repetitions of an address, we are never going to have 7 pairs so the attack will never work.
- 17th January   2007: Nicola Salmoria - CPS2 The Fight Continues: I've finished going through all the games previously supported by MAME using XOR files, and generating keys using this attack (http://mamelife.blogspot.com/2007/01/how-to-bruteforce-cps2.html). The attack needs a minimum of 7 (E,D) pairs at some address in order to work, though with just 7 pairs it takes several hours to find the key. Most of the games provided at least 8 pairs, a few 7, so the attack worked. On 11 games the attack didn't work. Three of them only provide 2 pairs, so there's no way for the attack to work--a different approach will be needed. The others provide 4 pairs, and I'm now trying to still perform the attack, using a new trick. Remember the complementation property? For every address A, we know that exists another address A1 such that D(X, A) = D(X ^ 0xffff, A1) ^ 0xffff. The problem is that we don't know A1. We can search it, however, using the XOR data. Pick an address, look at the four (E,D) pairs associated to it, and then see if at another address there is a pair (E ^ 0xffff, D ^ 0xffff). That way we can put together the information from the two addresses, raising the number of pairs from 4 to 7, barely enough to run the attack. There's a possibility of false positives when doing this, so avoid all pairs where E or D are 0x0000 or 0xffff, because those values are very common and make the probablity of a false positive much higher. In theory this trick should work, though it will require some luck and a lot of time. The holy grail remains an attack which could use pairs from different addresses; that would be the only way to retrieve the key for the games that lack XORs.
- 14th January   2007: Nicola Salmoria - CPS2 Getting Closer: The correlations between the 96-bit keys of the two Feistel networks were crucial in getting the s-boxes with 4 or 5 inputs "in sync"--that is, make them idential to the real ones apart from a fixed XOR or permutation applied to the whole box. Eventually, I ended with a layout which I'm 99.9% sure is equivalent to the real one. We cannot know the exact contents of the real s-boxes without getting them from the actual hardware, but the current ones should be matematically equivalent. The result is here: http://xoomer.alice.it/nicola.salmoria/cps2crptv2.zip. The most notable news is that the key is now reduced to 64 bits, and the one we are currently using should be identical to the one used by the hardware, apart from a fixed permutation of the bits. Finding the real permutation would be nice, but obviously that's not something we can determine from the algorithm, since the order of the bits of the key is completely irrelevant. What is interesting to note is that the keys used by some games don't seem to be random. If they were random one would expect there to be around 32 0s and 32 1s, but sometimes this isn't the case. E.g.: pzloop2: 3332206a0077f829; mshj: 01c0c951370f4c80; dstlka: 04048b4e2a498879; ringdest: 0405541367806575 and cybotsj: 0404821534388354. Of these, the last three literally scream "I'm not a random number!". Guessing the right bit order to make something appear, of course, is another matter. Some of the watchdog values contain birth dates, e.g. cmpi.l #$19660419,D1, so I expect the same thing might be happening here. Also, it makes sense for the pzloop2 one to be more regular than the others because it's third party game. On the key extraction front, things are going reasonably well. The brute force attack described in the previous article is working decently on most games, however for some of them the available data isn't enough. I'll have a more precise list once I've finished going through all the games. After that, we'll need to devise a better attack if we want to get the missing keys. The discovery that the key is only 64 bits might help to construct a better attack, though at the moment I don't have many ideas. The fact that the algorithm is divided in two parts, with the output of the first one affecting the key on the second part, complicates things.
- 12th January   2007: Nicola Salmoria - How to bruteforce CPS2: I couldn't devise an attack using differential cryptanalysis and the XOR files. The fact that the second 96-bit key changes with the address makes thing more difficult, and I couldn't think of a way to effectively use data from different addresses. The XOR files give us no more than 8-16 (E,D) pairs at a given address (remember that the encryption only uses the low 16 bits of the address). We have no choice of what data we have, so we have to make the best of it. So the idea I had is to use a meet in the middle brute force attack which exploits a weakness in the s-boxes. Remember also that the fn round functions are made of 4 s-boxes each. These are the 16 s-boxes, with their inputs and outputs. f2b1 is the weakest link. It has only four inputs, 0246. To get those four inputs, we need just three boxes in round 1: f1b1, which outputs 67, f1b3, which outputs 14, and f1b4, which outputs 02. We don't need f1b2, which outputs 35. So if we start from the ciphertext and run it through the first two rounds of the Feistel network, scanning all 224 possible keys for f1b1, f1b3, f1b4, and f2b1, we'll get all possible values for bits 46 of R2. Now let's start from the plaintext instead, and go up. If we scan all 26 keys for f4b2, we'll get all possible values for bits 47 of R2 again. Now we impose that bit 4 calculated in these two ways is the same, and given enough (E,D) pairs we have a huge pruning of the valid keys. From experiments, at least 8 pairs are needed for the attack to work effectively, but with 12 it's faster. When we have a match on bit 4, we start adding more key bits, 6 or 12 at a time. First f4b4, to match bit 6 of R2. Then f1b2 and f2b3, to match bit 7 of R2. At this point, we are most likely already left with a single key, so adding more key bits doesn't increase the computation time. The important thing is to do it 6 bits at a time, in order to avoid unnecessary calculations. Soon enough, we have reconstructed the whole 96-bit key. This will be the key at a specific address--of course, before running the search we'd have scanned the whole data and selected the address with most different pairs, in order to make the attack more effective. After the 96-bit key at one address is found, the rest is easy. Since the 96-bit key is modified by the 16-bit result of the first FN in a fixed way, we just use brute force to find the correct 16-bit value at every address, and then we have a full subkey table as when we had the full 8GB tables at the beginning. The process is working reasonably well, it's taking me 20-40 minutes to find the 192-bit key for a game. It could be made faster, probably. I've done some games for which I had more data, and Razoola was kind enough to provide additional data that will help with many other games. I'm not yet sure that the attack will work on all games, but it surely will on a good percentage. Some very good news after obtaining more keys is that I found strong correlations between the first and second 96-bit keys, so they are effectively the same key, just permuted. This will also allow to fix the order of the subtables in the s-boxes of the first FN, in the same way I did for the second. Should we consider ourselves finished after that? Not yet: whether it will be possible to generate keys for games for which we lack XOR data is an open problem. In that case, the best we can expect to do is to match the startup code from a different version of the game, so we'll have several (E,D) pairs at consecutive addresses, and no more than one pair at a given address. A new attack will have to be devised in order to use that kind of information. Hopefully the discovery that the first and second 96-bit keys are correlated will help.
- 0.111u3            : Andreas Naive and Nicola Salmoria replaced CPS2 CHDs with preliminary decryption function.
-  9th January   2007: Nicola Salmoria - CPS2 coming to MAME: I've submitted to MAMEDEV the code to replace the 4GB CHDs with 192-bit keys. It contains all the information needed to understand the algorithm, including the s-boxes. There is still a lot of uncertainty about the contents of the s-boxes. They do their job, but since they are different from the originals they also affect the key. Using the real s-boxes might make correlations between the key bits more apparent, if they exist (anyway, having only 7 keys to look at, there's not enough data to speculate on any kind of correlation). I'm hoping that it will be possible to extract the s-boxes contents from photos of the decapped CPS2 chip. That would be an important step forward in the accuracy of the emulation. Now the next challenge is finding the keys for the other CPS2 games that have XOR files but not full tables. I have some ideas, but it doesn't look simple. We have a lot of (E,D,k) triplets for those games, but unfortunately not many once you fix k (the 96-bit key used in the second FN), and that would be the most important part. Note that we don't have to find the whole 192-bit key all at once. Once the second 96-bit was found, then we could easily use brute force to get the 16-bit key seed at every address, and therefore easily find the first 96-bit key.
-  8th January   2007: Razoola - Nicola Salmoria of MAME Dev seems to have worked out the rest of the CPS2 algo (though there is still some s-boxes to complete), to quote his blog... * Take the 16-bit address and a 96-bit key and run them through the first Feistel network, to produce a 16-bit subkey. * Take the 16-bit ciphertext, 16-bit subkey, and another 96-bit key and run them through the second Feistel network, to produce the 16-bit plaintext. Our congratulations go out to him, again to Andreas Naive and also Charles MacDonald who all played a role to get to this point today. Looking back at the way things have gone from the first XOR release some six years ago (after the discovery of the main weakness in the system), we know some people were quite unhappy at our unwillingness to have this algo known for emulation (Statement of 7th Janurary 2001). It was always our intention to hold back information to help achieve this until the system was commercially dead (our view was 3 years after the last game released). It is very satisfying to know we achieved this as believe it or not Janurary 2007 is just past that three year mark (Hyper Street Fighter II was released in December 22nd 2003). I will update the encryption page with the details once Nicola has fully documented the Algo within MAME.
-  8th January   2007: Nicola Salmoria - CPS2 Fundamental Breakthrough: Today I realised why I was having problems with the correlations between subkey bits, where some bits had to be derived from the others not only using XOR, but also AND and OR. The reason was again in the s-boxes that only have 4 or 5 data inputs instead of the full 6. Those boxes contain 2 or 4 subtables, and the order of the subtables inside the box or the order of the bits inside each subtable isn't particularly important when decrypting a single address, because they can always be compensated by appropriate bits in the subkey. However, when putting all subkeys together, those things became important. E.g. I could be finding that when using subtable #3 in a box, then two of the inputs had to be inverted. To fix this, I had to rearrange the subtables inside the s-boxes to make everything in sync. The result was excellent. Previously, some of the correlations among the 96 bits were overly complex, taking up to 4 bits at once. Now every bit is directly correlated to another. The only exception is the bits that correspond to the "empty" inputs of s-boxes that take only 4 or 5 data inputs. What this means is that all 6 inputs of all s-boxes always receive the XOR of three sources: either a data bit, a key seed bit, and a global key bit; or two key seed bits, and a global key bit. That's only the beginning of the good news, though. After fixing the s-boxes, I could attack again the first part on the algorithm on the assumption it was a 4-round Feistel network, and indeed it was. So the algorithm turns out to be like this: Take the 16-bit address and a 96-bit key and run them through the first Feistel network, to produce a 16-bit subkey. Take the 16-bit ciphertext, 16-bit subkey, and another 96-bit key and run them through the second Feistel network, to produce the 16-bit plaintext. So now, for the first time, I would be able to produce a program that algorithmically decrypts one of the game for which we have full tables, without using any table. It's not yet time to celebrate, though: the s-boxes for the first Feistel network still have to be properly determined, and this might require having access to some more games. Once that is done, producing keys for games that we have complete tables for will be quite simple. Finding keys for games for which we don't have full tables, however, is an entirely different matter. As said above, we are potentially dealing with a 192-bit key here; it's possible that the key is smaller and the bits are reused, however since we don't know how they would be, we have to treat it like a 192-bit one. For a key of that size, obviously brute force is out of the question; and while the XOR tables do provide some information, it's probably not the kind of information that would allow to use the differential cryptanalysis techniques we'd need.
-  7th January   2007: Nicola Salmoria - CPS2 Won't Be Tamed That Easily: Some people thought we were almost finished with the CPS2 algorithm, but this doesn't seem to be the case. True, at least the 4GB tables could now be replaced with a single 128kB table, but that's still not how the hardware works, and it wouldn't be possible to generate proper keys for the games that are missing the full 8GB tables, which is the main concern. From the full tables, we can extract a 96-bit subkey for every address. These wouldn't be the actual keys used by the hardware, however I think me and Andy have agreed that they are, apart from a fixed XOR and bit permutation that wouldn't change from game to game. So we can forget about this step of the decryption for the time being, and move on. The problem now is to understand how the hardware generates the 96-bit subkey starting from the address and from the global key. I have determined that only 16 bits are needed to generate the 96-bit subkey; this was sort of expected, but it isn't without problems. We can generate only 94 bits of the subkey starting from those 16 bits and using only XOR operations. The remaining 2 bits need AND/OR operations, something which I have no explaination for at this point. That was the least of the problems anyway. The major hurdle at this point is that the mapping from address to 16-bit key seed is very far from trivial. The scheme should be as follows: Take 16-bit address, N-bit global key, and generate a 16-bit key seed using an unknown algorithm. Take 16-bit key seed, M-bit global key, and generate 96-bit subkey using an unknown algorithm. Take 16-bit ciphertext, 96-bit subkey, and generate 16-bit plaintext using the algorithm we have discovered. I think it would make sense for the algorithm in step 1. to be another 4-round Feistel network. If this is the case, things are quite harder than before. To break the other Feistel network, we could rely on complete knowledge of ciphertext-plaintext relationship. Now we can't: we only have a vague idea of what the 16-bit key seed could be. If we could rely on a 16-bit value except for a constant XOR and permutation, it wouldn't be a problem, since that wouldn't change the nature of the Feistel network. Unfortunately, we don't have that luxury. Let's see that with an example. Let's say that the first algorithm generates a 4-bit key seed, abcd, which is expanded into the 6-bit subkey ABCDEF this way: A = a; B = a XOR b; C = a XOR c; D = b XOR c; E = b XOR d; F = b XOR c XOR d. We don't know anything about abcd, all we see is ABCDEF, but we need to guess what abcd looks like. So we notice that D = B XOR C; F = A XOR C XOR E; and we decide that a' = A; b' = B; c' = C; d' = E; so we would have A = a'; B = b'; C = c'; D = b' XOR c'; E = d'; F = a' XOR c' XOR d'. This all works as far as generating the subkey from the seed goes, the problem is that abcd and a'b'c'd' are two completely different numbers! We have that a'b'c'd' = abcd XOR aab; so this isn't simply a XOR with a constant value, it's a variable modification of the number. And this is something that the Feistel network cannot handle.
-  6th January   2007: Nicola Salmoria - CPS2 Subkeys: I said earlier that I was going to post the program to extract subkeys from a CHD, and the subkey lists for a few games, however after extracting the subkeys I found important relationships between the subkey bits so I'll have to work on that first. A subkey consists of 24*4 = 96 bits. There are 65536 subkeys, so the total is 786kB of data. What I found that one bit of the subkey is constant, while 59 can be derived from the others with a XOR (which is constant for all 65536 addresses, but changes from game to game). So this hints at a 64-bit global key, while the independent subkey bits drop for now at 96-1-59 = 36 bits.
- 19th December  2006: Nicola Salmoria - CPS2 notes, part 5: In part 1 i showed some constant values in the table that shows how many times flipping a bit in the ciphertext flips a bit in the plaintext. But there's more than that. It seems that there are more properties which are true for all games, regardless of the key (see table). So in total there are 2x4x2x2x4 = 128 combinations. Each combination is used by exactly 256 tables. Note the symmetry of it all. 16 values are affected, related to 2 bits of the ciphertext and 8 bits of the plaintext. This suggests that the algorithm might work on the data 8 bits at a time, or even only 4 bits at a time. The regular behaviour could be caused by a step, at the beginning or at the end of the algorithm, that doesn't use the key. Another thing we can do is check which of the 128 combinations corresponds to each memory address, and look for a way to correlate the two. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a simple way to do that.
- 19th December  2006: Nicola Salmoria - CPS2 notes, part 4: I have to stress that there is NO progress being made in breaking the encryption. The things I am showing in these notes have been known for over a year and haven't lead to any breakthrough. Hopefully, a public discussion of these properties could generate some valuable feedback. There also isn't any kind of competition against the people that are attacking the CPS2 encryption in hardware. On the contrary, I think that the hardware path will be the only way to gather more information about the algorithm. In these notes I have shown several properties that are always true, regardless of the key. This means that they are properties of the algorithm itself, and therefore are hardcoded in hardware. For example, there almost surely are fixed substitution boxes which could be extracted from the custom CPU. If an algorithm is reconstructed by studying the CPU, we can also test it against the known properties, regardless of the key. If it doesn't match, then the algorithm isn't right. Once an algorithm fitting the properties is found, we can start looking for the key.
- 18th December  2006: Nicola Salmoria - CPS2 notes, part 3: In part 1 we were flipping bits in the ciphertext, and seeing what happened to bits in the plaintext. We can do the opposite, of course, and there's something unexpected in the results. I'll show the total number of times the bits change (in hex) instead of percentages, to make the point more visible (see table). The values highlighted in orange are the only two that are constant in every table (there were four in the inverse table). But the values highlighted in red are the most interesting. They are not constant--they can vary among a few possible values. But the sum of the two values in each column is constant, and it's always 0x10000. Why? I have no idea.
- 18th December  2006: Nicola Salmoria - CPS2 notes, part 2: The complementation property was an important discovery--and not just because it reduces the size of the tables in half. Still, we haven't taken full advantage of it yet. Let's recap the basics of the CPS2 encryption first. Inputs: 16-bit value stored in ROM; 16-bit address (bits 1-17 of the physical address) key of unknown size, different for every game Outputs: 16-bit decrypted value. Let's call D(X,A,K) the decryption of value X at address A using key K. The complementation property says that for every A there is exactly one A1 such that D(X,A,K) = D'(X',A1,K) where x' is the complement of x. This finding is important because it shows that A has an algorithmical effect on the encryption. In Sega's FD1094 CPU, the key for every address is just stored in a huge table. If the CPS2 CPU worked in the same way, the complementation property wouldn't happen. This isn't too much of a surprise: with the Kabuki CPU, we had already seen that Capcom preferred a complex algorithm with a small key, while Sega preferred a simpler algorithm with a huge key. Unfortunately we don't yet know how to calculate A1 given A. It varies from game to game so it must be a function of the key. The complementation property isn't unheard of, even in strong ciphers, so it isn't necessarily a weakness in the algorithm. For example, DES (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard#Minor_cryptanalytic_properties) has it. In that case, it reads D(X,K) = D'(X',K'). In general, the complementation property indicates that there are probably XOR operations happening, which cause the complement operation to cancel out. Let's see this with an example: consider a substitution function f, and an algorithm such that d = e XOR f(e XOR k), if we take the complements we have e' XOR f(e' XOR k') = e' XOR f(e XOR k) = (e XOR f(e XOR k))' = d' of course this is a very simple example. Note that x' doesn't have to be the complement in this case: you can define it as e.g. x' = x XOR 1, and it will still work. So the CPS2 algorithm obviously isn't that simple. A more realistic example would be a Feistel network (note that DES is an example of a Feistel network). If you define the Feistel network as Li = Ri-1 and Ri = Li-1 XOR f(Ri-1 XOR Ki-1). It should be easy to see how the complementation property would ensue. The idea of the CPS2 encryption being a Feistel network is tempting, however I don't think this is the case, because I would expect the diffusion to be much better than what we have seen in part 1.
- 17th December  2006: Nicola Salmoria - CPS2 notes, part 1: Since the finding of the complementation property (sfzj_049e38[x] ^ 0xffff == sfzj_05ee0c[x ^ 0xffff]  => 8GB / 2 is still 4GB) almost one year ago, there has been no progress at all on the CPS2 encryption. I'm going to explain here some of the (remarkably few) things we know about the encryption. A common misconception is that the decryption tables look like "random data". They may look so to the naked eye, but the most basic statistical checks show that this isn't the case. Take an encrypted value, change a bit in it, and look at what happens to the output. For a random table, you'd expect every bit in the decrypted value to change with 50% probability. This isn't happening. Take a look at the following statistics taken on a single table (see http://mamelife.blogspot.com/): on rows, you have the encrypted bit that changes; on columns, the frequency with which the decrypted bit changes. So there is a large number of values around 50%, which look just random, but there are also values very far from that. This indicates that the encryption algorithm doesn't have good diffusion. This is a weakness, though it hasn't been exploited yet. Of particular interest are the four values I highlighted in red. While the other values change from game to game and from table to table, those four values are always the same. E.g. flipping bit 9 in the encrypted value causes bit 0 in the decrypted value to flip exactly 0x5080 times out of 0x10000, for every game, at every address. This property is quite interesting. It is the most obvious "signature" of the algorithm. Does it help? Well, it tells us that if the algorithm contains bit permutations that depend on the key, those permutations cannot affect bits 3 and 9 in the encrypted value, nor bits 0 and 14 of the decrypted data. Apart from that, however, the property doesn't tell us much, because even if we know that the bits have to change that many times, we don't know exactly when to flip them. Discovering that would be a significant advance in the understanding of the algorithm.
- 0.110u4            : CPS2 updates [David Haywood]: Added table for Jyangokushi (from Guru). Note that GFX/Sound roms aren't dumped on this one. Removed old 'handcrafted' XORs for games which we have CHDs for and replaced them with XORs generated from MAME using the CHD. This means anyone with the CHD can easily generate the XORs (using the code I've left in there) if they need to be able to run the games with a shorter startup time. Disabled the loading of the XORs by default for all sets with a CHD. Now only the CHD is loaded, unless the #define is changed at the top in which case only the XORs generated from the CHD are loaded.
- 0.110u3            : David Haywood added raw decryption table to choko. Enabled the use of the large CHD-based tables by default.
- 0.110u2            : David Haywood added support for using CHDs to decrypt CPS2 games. This code is disabled for the moment, but will be enabled in the future. Only a handful of games have complete tables so far. These tables are huge (~4GB) and uncompressable until the encryption algorithm is understood.
- 19th September 2006: Charles MacDonald - With the success of the Choko dump from a while ago, I'm working to get the CPS-2 dumping tools and instructions updated. Changes were made from the last version, mostly bugfixes and speed-ups to decrease the amount of time it takes to dump a full table set. There's also a minor modification that needs to be done to the PCB, to ensure stability, though now that it's known which features are absolutely needed, I might redesign it. Admittedly not many people have been interested in getting more of the games dumped, probably because all the popular ones we wasted tons of quarters on are already emulated!
- 0.105u3            : Aaron Giles uncommented/added missing undumped ROMs/XORs in the CPS2 games.
- 0.105u1            : David Haywood updated CPS driver to more accurately draw tilemaps, based on evidence from a board with mixed ROMs.
- 14th February  2006: Guru - A CPS2 USB adapter arrived, thanks to Charles MacDonald. The adapter plugs into the 64-pin CN7 on the B board. The chips on the bench are the original ROMs and PALs. ROM3 is changed and ROM10 is added. Plus 1 PAL on the A board is changed and 2 PALs on the B board are changed. Unfortunately, none of the PALs were socketed and this particular B board didn't have a CN7 connector! So I had to desolder a CN7 connector from another dead CPS2 board and solder it to this board and desolder and socket the 3 PALs as well! Luckily she still works! It's not that exciting to look at though.
- 15th January   2006: Razoola - Nicola Salmoria has reported on his blog some progress in understanding the CPS2 algo. He has managed to shrink the current 8gig table of SFZ down to 4gig. This is the first breakthrough in understanding the encryption used. For more information visit his blog.
- 11th January   2006: Charles MacDonald - I've tried to package and clean up all the CPS-2 related development stuff I have that was used for table dumping. This can be used for writing CPS-2 software, running tests on the system, and dumping table data so we can hopefully figure out the encryption at some point. I will definitely include more sample programs, documentation and hardware information in future updates to the package, but I wanted to get this off my to-do list.
-  5th January   2006: Razoola - While playing around coding on a dead CPS-2 board I have today I found that the encryption algo is still fully in place even after the CPS-2 board has suicided. That said, on examining values the number do not match those of the expected game. This almost certainly confirms that their is only _one_ algo over all CPS-2 games with the only difference being key data (like Kabuki on CPS-1). I passed some test code onto Charles MacDonald so that he can check the values he gets there (on his dead SFA3 board). Those should match what I see here and to be honest it looks just a formality. When you consider the watchdog on a suicide board is 0xFFFF,0xFFFF,0xFFFF (example opcode, CMPI.L #$FFFFFFFF,$FFFF0000) everything starts to make sence. There was a big debate over this going back to when we first broke past the protection. The worry voiced by some DEVs was that all boards would be needed again to get the algo for each game. This new discovery certainly confirms that once the algo is known for one game all the others can be brute forced using the XOR tables. As for figuring out the algo itsself whats needed now is a complete dump of tables (8gig) of the algo executing in this default state. Using this the algo should be easier to understand because any key data used for math should be 0xFFFF. I have quickly dumped a complete table for a couple of addresses and while it still looks a mess there are certinally more patterns compared to a normal game. Update: I've got word back from Charles and after some work (over irc) he has managed to get the same data I was seeing. This basically confirms what I mentioned above. There were some initial problems with his transfer system (which is far superior to mine) giving different results. It turned out that at some point during the process the protected RAM was being reprogrammed!!! The exact way this is happening is not yet known but it opens up some large posibilities if the cause can be found and understood. This situation did not happen when he was dumping games that were non suicide. It currently looks like there is no way to get a full 8gig table because the protected region in a suicide state seems to be only 0x10000 bytes where a complete table covers 0x20000 bytes. Hopefully we can get around this.
-  4th January   2006: Razoola - I have written a small tool that can be programmed onto EPROM and used to test if a CPS2 board has suicided.
- 19th November  2005: Charles MacDonald - Thanks to a generous donation from Razoola and the CPS2Shock team, I've been given B-boards for the following games: sfzj, csclubj and sfz3. I have dumped complete table sets from the first two and am doing tests on the latter. It has no battery, so I can see how the hardware works when the battery-backed SRAM is erased. With a much larger data set (32 GB) spanning four games, hopefully some patterns will be discovered. I'm still interested in dumping a regional variant for one of the currently dumped games to see what kinds of similarities might exist between the two. Most likely I will revise and release the tools and specifications for my CPS-2 development setup in the future. Then other people could dump table sets from their games and contribute to this project. There are so many CPS-2 games out there that I couldn't possibly do it all myself, nor would I want to.
- 12th October   2005: Charles MacDonald - Getting a bunch of PCBs to work with in the next few weeks: three CPS-2 'B' boards (more on those next update), Shanghai for HD63484 tests, and a Quartet 2 board. I'll continue my CPS-2 research once the other games arrive. One of them has no battery so I can skip the annoying encryption and run tests directly, which will be a huge convenience. I think right now all the useful data that can be extracted from xmcota and pzloop2j has been obtained.
- 30th September 2005: Charles MacDonald - I've been doing some research on the CPS-2 hardware in the last few months, starting as soon as the System 32 work was put on hold. I'll give a basic overview of the encryption, however I should point out I'm just elaborating on the findings that Razoola originally made, which are at CPS-2 Shock. As you can imagine the results of his prior experiments have been absolutely essential to this project. The CPS-2 hardware uses a custom 68000 CPU running at 16MHz, though the effective speed is lower due to video DMA. Out of the 16MB address range, the lower 4MB is allocated for ROMs storing program code and data. The first 1MB of this area is where decryption is enabled, though the exact boundary under the 4MB point may change from game to game. In addition to the address range check, there is a timer that expires after a certain amount of time has passed. When this happens, decryption is turned off and the 68K will execute code exactly as it is read from memory. A sequence of one or more specific instructions, changing on a per-game basis, will reset the timer and enable encryption again. The timer can be restarted after any duration from when it has expired. The decryption logic uses bits A16 through A1 of the 68K address bus, meaning the encryption wraps every 128K. For each encrypted word at a given address there is exactly one unique output; in contrast to the FD1094 there are no disabled opcodes or 'blanked' data that resolve to the same decrypted value. Data read from the supervisor or user code space is decrypted (e.g. opcodes and operands) and data from the supervisor or user data space is not. The size of a complete set of decrypted data for one game quite large, totalling 8GB - it takes forever to dump. There are no duplicate tables within a game's table set or between sets for different games, though I've only examined tables dumped from the two 'B' boards I have. I've discussed analysis of the table data with a few other people and so far the encryption seems to be pretty tough to solve. As a result, I think progress will depend on additional help. If you have skill in this type of thing (strong mathematics background and familiarity with encryption) and would like to lend a hand, then please get in contact with me. Working with the CPS-2 hardware has been challenging due to the large amount of custom parts involved. I designed a communications board with a USB adapter, DTACK generator, and interface to the CPS-2 video and peripheral bus to run software on it, as well as several adapters to replace the 16V8 GALs with more capable 22V10 GALs that have their own shared I/O bus. Small update for some common questions: The two games I've dumped are xmcota and pzloop2j, which are both already emulated in MAME. The ETA for a complete table dump (65,536 files) is 9 hours, and it's fully automated. Sometimes the system locks up randomly and has to be reset which slows things down, this occured quite a lot for pzloop2j and not at all for xmcota. They have different types of B boards, perhaps that has something to do with it. Many people are suggesting to look at Street Fighter Zero and it's variants, as well as Rockman which had a less common CPS-2 release but is very similar to the CPS-1 version. The only thing that would be really useful is to find two games that are encrypted with the same or similar keys, so unless Rockman has an identical key as another game it's not that useful. I would be interested in getting data out of another variant of xmcota.
- 27th October   2004: Razoola - There seems to be someone making quick hacks of XOR files we have released in the past to get games running which don't currently have XORs. While this sounds a good thing it's actually no different than using the region switch option in kawaks for example. The big problem is that these new XOR's contain incorrect information in relation to what the real encryption would return for many addresses when compared to real hardware. It also makes it less likely for these games to be donated in the future so good XOR's can be created as people will think they already have good XOR's. The reality is these new hacked XOR's are prone to all the bugs that come with using region switching in CPS2 games. It's for these reasons that I want it known I have nothing to do with these hacks and I would advise against them being used officially in any emulator as they cannot guarantee an accurate game.
- NOTES: The CPS-2 encryption only affects opcodes, not data. It consists of two 4-round Feistel networks (FN) and involves both the 16-bit opcode and the low 16 bits of the address. The hardware also has different watchdog opcodes and address range (see below) which are stored in the battery backed RAM. There doesn't appear to be any relation between those and the 64-bit encryption key, so they probably use an additional 64 bits of battery-backed RAM. The encryption does _not_ cover the entire address space. The range covered differs per game. The CPS2 system has a watchdog system that will disable the decryption of data if the watchdog isn't triggered at least once every few seconds. The trigger varies from game to game (some games do use the same) and is basically a 68000 opcode/s instruction. The instruction is the same for all regions of the game. The watchdog instructions are listed alongside the decryption keys.

P4.1   DS1204

- 0.152              : Added machine\ds1204.c/h. Created DS1204 device & switched Megatouch (meritm.c) to use it instead of it's own local version (driver could do with some more tidying up as not all games use a key but currently it is hooked up to all games). Default data comes from a region instead of coded in driver, commands & security match are now compared, data is clocked on the correct edge, key can be written to and is saved to NVRAM. Improved logging. Hooked up DS1204 to Touchmaster driver, but haven't found what it checks for yet. Changed PATCH_PROTECTION to 0 in tmaster.c and VERBOSE_LEVEL to 2 in ds1204.c then look for "-> command" in error.log to find the subsequent read from the dq pin for reading the identification and secure memory. For tm4k the first two bytes of the NVRAM need to be  0x00, 0xa0. From scratch you'll need to play a game before it will complain about the protection, but after that it will complain on every boot. It tries five different contents for the compare register at various points during the bootup, this may be for obfuscation as the real chip will return random results if the key is wrong. If the keys are available it might be easier to dump them than figure out exactly what it wants [smf].

P4.2   DS5002FP

- 0.188              : Added machine\gaelco_ds5002fp.cpp. Added dumped DS5002FP chip to TH Strikes Back, Touch & Go and World Rally 2 using the method published by Morten Shearman Kirkegaard and Peter Wilhelmsen as documented at http://www.afdelingp.dk/files/articles/ds5002fp/ds5002fp.pdf [Morten Shearman Kirkegaard, Peter Wilhelmsen, David Haywood]. Note: A 2nd verification pass is still needed on them from additional boards, as bad bits existed in World Rally 2 even prior to extraction (steering logic was broken but bad byte was identified and fixed as the code for that command handler was identical to World Rally 1) and TH Strikes Back is crashing at the first boss (could also be a CPU core issue). The DS5002FP SRAM for World Rally 2 has been dumped from 2 PCBs. The first had unused space filled as 0x00, the 2nd space was filled as 0xff. In addition, the first had 2x bad bytes and was partially patched out, so we're using the 2nd dump. Glass was also dumped, but at the time the data wasn't extracted, only the code, and the board has since died, so needs redoing. Alligator Hunt was dumped and works, but not yet added, want to verify on a 2nd PCB first as the process does corrupt some bytes and a couple had to be handfixed, so the only way to know for sure is multiple dumps. Made DS5002FP store battery-backed internal RAM and SFR registers as NVRAM. Made SFR defaults configurable in ROM loading like NVRAM defaults. Made external SRAM persistent as well (some games store scores etc. in it). Cleaned up Touch & Go dump and added preconfigured internal RAM. Created device for Gaelco protection module and removed remaining simulation code [David Haywood]. Clean up Galeco Dallas hookup device: There is no need for a second device for World Rally and Glass, it's the same thing. How the address lines are hooked up for host memory access is part of the driver and can be done with a mirror/mask in the address map provided by the driver. There's also no need for the SRAM trampolines in the device, that can be done entirely through address maps. The drivers need trampolines to do the address swizzling. We should be able to get rid of these when we get better support for 8-bit views of 16-bit components (dooyong drivers also have ugly trampolines for doing this kind of thing) [Vas Crabb].
- 0.128u3            : Removed cpu\ds5002fp\ds5002fp.c/h, ds5002fpdasm.c and ds5002fpops.c. Merged DS5002FP into MCS51 [Couriersud]: Merged DS5002FP. Disassembler now uses type specific memory names. Merged DS5002FP disasm. Added 83C751 memory names to disassembler. Delete DS5002FP specific files. Removed unnecessary cpu callback in wrally. DATA_MAP ==> IO_MAP in wrally.

- 12th May       2008: Manuel Abadia - World Rally emulation is complete. I implemented priorities (that were trickier than I thought), shadows/highlights and a few missing bits in the video hardware. The game is fully playable from beginning to end without any problem as far as I can tell. I thought there was a bug in the video hardware emulation somewhere... So I plugged my PCB and compared it to the driver. The problem is also in the original arcade game. Because of the way an arcade monitor works, the problem is nearly unnoticeable in the original game. I also checked if the original PCB had the same "shadow effect" for the tiles, yes the hardware works that way. Something curious about the protection... Javier told ElSemi that the protection of this game took 8 months of work, so imagine how complicated it was... even the dallas has some code that performs some pseudorandom dummy accesses to the shared RAM to make black box attacks even more difficult. To clarify a question about the other protected games, having the World Rally dallas code does not help to emulate the protection of them. As MAME now has a DS5002FP core and the other games are almost fully emulated, if we get the dallas code for a game, it will be playable quickly. Finally, I want to thank to all the people that made this possible. It was cool to be part of this. It has brought me some good memories and healed my wounds with Gaelco.
- 10th May       2008: Manuel Abadia - Playable status reached: Javier sent us (via ElSemi) detailed information about how the encryption process worked. However, he told us that the sheets of paper that contained the encryption info were a bit difficult to read in some places (remember that this protection was designed 15 years ago) so probably there was some mistakes in the excel file he sent us. ElSemi and I tried to add it with the information he gave us but we didn't have success. Nicola Salmoria did an excellent work (as always) consolidating the information and obtaining the missing information. He generated a working decryption function that not only works for World Rally, but also for Squash and Thunder Hoop. Mike Coates also completed the interface to get the data from a World Rally PCB, so he was able to supply the encrypted/decrypted data that was needed to get the specific details to decrypt World Rally properly. Special mention to Andreas Naive too. The high level information Javier told us a few days ago was already discovered by Andreas and posted in his page a couple of months ago. Before Javier sent us detailed information about how the encryption worked I contacted Andreas Naive about the encryption and he told me that he didn't have free time at the moment to look at it. However he told me an intuition he had about the algorithm: "I remember that my last feeling was that to decipher each 16 bits block, it was done in 3 chunks: a first 6 bits chunk and then two 5 bits chunks, each of them based in a/some bits of the first chunk. I don't remember exactly which ones, but the first chunk was the one with a simple structure (based on the tables I published), while the other two were the ones that shown a more complex structure (and carry effects)". He was completely right as that was how it worked the encryption that Javier sent us. It is good to have geniouses around. After adding the decryption to the driver the game looks fine. It has a few graphic glitches that will be fixed soon but it seems to be PLAYABLE.
-  7th May       2008: Manuel Abadia - The Dallas DS5002FP core is complete. The additions to the 8051 core are: Extra Special Function Registers, Byte-wide Bus Support, Memory Partition and Memory Range, Bootstrap Configuration, Power Fail Interrupt, Timed Access, Stop Mode and Idle Mode. I didn't bother to add support for Peripherals, the Reprogrammable Peripheral Controller or CRC-16 support because it isn't used by the game. The communication between the Dallas and the main CPU seems to be working, however, the game writes some bytes to the encrypted Video RAM, it reads them back and then makes some calls based on the decrypted data. As the current decryption is wrong, the game doesn't work yet and never uses the dallas for anything interesting right now. The decryption of the Video RAM is in the same state as it was. However, ElSemi asked Javier for information about the decryption and he is trying to help us. He didn't remember how it was performed but we send him the information we got about it in 2002 (when Mike connected the PCB to the fluke) to refresh a bit his memory. Thanks to that, he gave us another point of view about how the encryption may work. Even if he is right, we still need to get data from the original PCB. Hopefully, somewhere in the process we end up with a clean decrypt function that uses no tables. Understanding some code I was able to guess some decrypted values and get this (see snapshot). It looks really ugly as the colors for the tiles aren't decrypted properly but this finally confirms that World Rally uses the same Video Hardware as Target Hits. The only change seems to be the additional palette entries for the night races. I have seen how the palette was configured in a night race and I have an idea of how the palette works for the night races (not very different from World Rally 2), but we'll have to wait until the game works to implement it. So, the current status is that if the Video RAM is decrypted properly and we are lucky, the game should work without the light effects (and maybe some priority problems) and be playable. If we are not that lucky, hopefully the problems are not difficult to find and fix.
-  5th May       2008: Manuel Abadia - If you have tried to execute World Rally since it was added to MAME you have seen the precarious state of the driver. The protection of World Rally is double: 1. Encrypted Video RAM: The encrypted Video RAM transforms a 32 bits value written to it to another value that is really complex to derive from the original value. This protection was also used in Thunder Hoop and Squash. Mike Coates connected a fluke to his PCBs and got a 4 GB file will all possible combinations (2^32) for Thunder Hoop and Squash. Using that file, the encryption process was replicated. However, it was not very practical to require a 16 GB file to run the game. Nicola Salmoria studied the file and generated some code (about 400 lines) that replicated the original encryption. That's why you can play Thunder Hoop and Squash. Why World Rally encryption is incomplete? All of us wanted to see World Rally running before any other game, so we started studying World Rally before Squash and Thunder Hoop. In that time, we thought that the encryption was only performed in 16 bits, not 32. Unfortunately, when Mike got all decrypted values (2^16), the code was clearly showing that the decrypted values were not correct in most cases (for example, one of the methods that draws the tiles uses a decrypted value for the number of tiles to draw. That's why the power on self test results and other screens look horrible right now). After we find that out, the decryption efforts were centered in the other games. As World Rally was not going to be playable unless the dallas code was dumped (something that seemed unlikely), it has remained that way. 2. Dallas DS5002FP secure MCU: The Dallas MCU in the Gaelco games has some critical code that handles inputs, objects manipulation and other complex calculations that prevent the game from working properly (Take a look at World Rally 2 if you don't know what I mean). The DS5002FP MCU has been one of the best chips for protecting information on its era making emulation of these games impossible for now. There are some specialized labs that claim to be able to get the code from a DS5002FP but it is an incredibly expensive process we can't afford. I have to admit that I thought that I'd never see World Rally emulated, as I approached some people at Gaelco and Zigurat for the Dallas code without luck. However, the other day I received an email that changed my mind. Miguel Angel Horna (ElSemi) did a talk at Lleida Lan Party about emulation. At the party he met one of the Gaelco founders (Javier Valero) that was there to speak about the arcade game industry. ElSemi and Javier talked about the protection in some Gaelco games and Javier was kind enough to provide the dallas code for World Rally. With the internal code of the DS5002FP it is just a matter of time to finally have a working driver in MAME. I have been completely inactive from MAME development for a while but as I worked on the drivers of all the Gaelco 2D games (except Master Boy) and I spent a lot of time and money on them, I thought it was a good time to resume my work on MAME. Mike Coates is trying to get all the possible values from World Rally Video RAM so we can advance in that area too. Currently I am writing a DS5002FP core to run the dallas code. The DS5002FP is just a 8051 MCU with some additions and as MAME already has a 8051 core things are going fast. For example, the initial coprocessor test works (although it is a trivial test to pass without the dallas code). Also, adding the Power Fail Interrupt of the dallas I managed to see this screen that is supposed to be seen when the dallas is dying. After the both protections are emulated the driver will need more work as probably the video hardware emulation isn't complete and needs some tweaks here and there but I'm confident that World Rally will be playable in a not so distant future. I don't know if Javier will give us more dallas code or not, but hats off to him for this one. Also, thanks a lot to ElSemi for being able to get the dallas code from him.
-  8th December  2002: Manuel Abadia sent in a driver for Target Hits but it is unplayable due to an undumped DS5002FP MCU.

P5.11  MB8841

- 0.122u8            : Cleaned up Kangaroo driver [Aaron Giles]: Documented MB8841 (needs to be decapped to get code). Proper video timing. Full memory maps. Simplified and more accurate video logic.
- 25th January   2007: Guru - For those that didn't realise, the chip below is a Namco Custom 54xx and is used on Xevious, Galaga, Bosconian and Pole Position for generating some sounds (for example the 'death bang' sound in Galaga). The chip is actually a Fujitsu MB884x-family microcontroller with 1k internal maskROM. If you want to blow your mind with technical details, the datasheet is here (http://www.sharpmz.org/download/mb8843.pdf).
- 23rd January   2007: Guru - Here's a few pics of the very first custom chip that I sent to a professional Japanese IC decapping company that we (MAMEdev) are using to help us with some MAME-related things. Hopefully if this is successful, more will follow and also hopefully talented hardware devs like JROK (http://www.jrok.com/) will be able to make replacements for it to repair real PCBs. You may also be wondering why we're doing this instead of using some other people who frequent the 'boards' who have offered to do this kind of thing for free? The answer is fairly simple... Apart from the amount of time it takes to get this done, the level of communication is somewhat 'sporadic' and so far offers to supply other chips to them have been ignored. We requested pics of some CPS2 ICs that were said to have been decapped and so far nothing has surfaced (over a month has passed since then). Doing it this way gives us more control over what we achieve and ensures the work is done in a timely manner. Apart from that, the plan to get this IC decapped has been in the works for several months, so we might as well use the professional IC decapping company whenever possible because the amount of ICs we need to decap is possibly too much work for someone to do in their spare time for free.

- 0.131u1            : Aaron Giles fixed MCS51 disassembler to work properly when there are two memory arguments (the second would overwrite the first).
- 0.128u6            : Aaron Giles removed hack for setting MCS51 serial callbacks. Updated micro3d to use new functions.
- 0.128u4            : Switched MCS51 to new memory functions [Couriersud].
- 0.128u3            : Couriersud converted the MCS-51 core to reference data via pointers. Merged DS5002FP into MCS51 [Couriersud]: Merged DS5002FP. Disassembler now uses type specific memory names. Merged DS5002FP disasm. Added 83C751 memory names to disassembler. Delete DS5002FP specific files. Removed unnecessary cpu callback in wrally. DATA_MAP ==> IO_MAP in wrally.
- 0.128u2            : Changed cpu\i8051\i8051.c/h, 8051dasm.c and i8051ops.c to cpu\mcs51\mcs51.c/h, mcs51dasm.c and mcs51ops.c. MCS-51 improvements [Couriersud, Jim Stolis]: Fixed split timer mode. No interrupts for timer 0 modes 0,1,2 while timer 1 in mode 3. MCS51 core now supports 4 interrupt levels depending on CPU type. According to Philips, 80C31 is a 80C52 family member with 128K internal ram and no rom. Implemented CMOS features: Powerdown & idle. Added comments about special function registers on Philips 80C52. Cleaned up reset routines. Fixed INT0 & INT1 interrupt line handling. Finally move cpu\i8051 to cpu\mcs51, rename files and some constants. Quotes from the documentation added to the source as well. Started DS5002FP integration.
- 0.128u1            : MCS51/I8051 improvements [Couriersud, Jim Stolis]: Improved serial port timing. Better infrastructure for adding more variants like DS5002. Fixed port reading. Rewrote Macros for better readibility. Fixed and rewrote Interrupt handling. Now returns INTERNAL_DIVIDER and adjusted cycle counts. Remove unnecessary and duplicated code. Remove unnecessary functions. Rewrite to have sfr-registers stored in int_ram. Debugger may now watch sfr-registers as well. Implemented interrupt callbacks (HOLD_LINE now supported). Runtime switch for processor type - remove ifdefs. Internal memory maps for internal rom versions (internal ram now displayed in debugger). More timer cleanups from manual. Fixed timer 2 interrupts. Implement serial mode 2/3 rx and tx clock handling. Remaining games checked and adapted to changes in cpu core. Cardline still broken. I need the exact and complete cpu name. Added more variants 803X, 80CXX and AT89C4051. Fixed segas18.c (segaic16.c) MCU maps. Fixed sslam.c. Fixed issue with core allocation of ram (duplicate savestate) in limenko.c and videopkr.c.
- 0.127u7            : Grull Osgo fixed i8051 timers and the AJMP opcode to take 2 bytes instead of 3.
- 0.126u3            : I8051 CPU core timer updates [Wilbert Pol]: Added support for timer mode 0 (13 bit timer). Cleaned up timer code a bit, fixing some off-by-one errors when timers overflow.
- 0.125u5            : In the i8051 core, timer 0's second split counter was incorrectly checking the Timer 1 Run Control Bit. Fixed it [Jim Stolis].
- 0.122u8            : Jim Stolis corrected previous i8051 timer fix to use more accurate IE SFRs.
- 0.122u7            : Jim Stolis fixed I8051 timers from firing when not enabled. Checking TCON alone is not enough to invoke timers. Added IE SFR flags in conditional.
- 21st January   2008: Jim Stolis - Hack Free: I finally found the bug that was forcing me to add memory hacks to the driver in order for it to bypass the memory tests for each game. The I8051 core library was basically firing the timers when they were sometimes not enabled. What this did was cause the timer interrupts to modify memory while the memory check subroutine was running. The memory check routine was writing specific values into memory and verifying that they read back the same value that was written. But with the timers updating memory at the same time, the memory check would not find the values it was expecting and therefore fail. The fix should help slightly increase the responsiveness of the game code too. I believe the I8051 core has other areas to investigate, but this fix is a huge change for the driver. With the fix in place, all memory hacks in the driver can be removed. This means any new clones that are added in the future should drop in nicely without any special memory modifications. I will be submitting a new driver update in the near future with all the hacks removed.

Removed redundant and unused definitions from header file. Renamed constants and functions to be MCS48* prefixed. Re-verified all opcode behaviors and timing. Changed illegal opcodes to count 1 cycle to avoid infinite loops. Changed EA behavior so that it is a push from the driver instead of a pull on each opcode fetch (this may change further in the future).

P6.A   I8751

- 0.131u1            : Aaron Giles added and began hooking up the 8751's for the System 1 games. Still some work to do. Dr. Decapitator, Guru and Angelo Salese added proper I8751 MCU dump for Black Tiger.
-  6th April     2007: Charles MacDonald - I was running some timing tests on the 8751 MCUs used in several Sega games, and noticed they seemd to respond to the internal ROM / external program memory select pin (/EA) even when it was changed after a reset. I thought this meant it may have been possible to force the MCU to run a user specified program and dynamically enable/disable the internal ROM while running. This ended up not being the case, the opcodes are fetched but not acted upon. Maybe the MCU internally drives NOPs onto the data bus. I wonder if the program counter continually increments so that you could force the PC to get into the external program memory range, but in the limited testing environment I had set up this didn't seem to happen. Probably the PC is never incremented. This behavior seems to be standard across the Intel C8751 and D8751 chips. If /EA is pulled high or left unconnected, the internal ROM program runs. If /EA is tied to ground it stops execution and starts fetching opcodes by strobing /PSEN repeatedly. You can change /EA as many times as you want and reset the MCU with it in different states, you'll get the same behavior every time. It's unfortunate, but at least this confirms that a trick used to dump some protected 8051s will not work on these MCUs in particular. I compared their operation to a unprotected AT89C52 which responded correctly, so this is definitely a function of the MCU security bit(s).
- 0.104u4            : Aaron Giles fixed the 8751 MCU (8751MCUgames0104u3: segas16a/b, segas18 games using a 8751 are not working).
- 0.90               : Nicola Salmoria updated the Super Qix driver. Repaired the ROM code and added support for the I8751 MCU, so the two original sets work.
- 0.89u1             : Aaron Giles hooked up the 8751 in mwalk, mwalka and mwalkb and fixed sound ROM loading - all games now work.
- 25th November  2004: R. Belmont - Converted Steve Ellenoff's i8031/8051/8052/8731/8751/8752 core to the latest MAME core and submitted it so Aaron can emulate the protection in Sega's "Moonwalker" properly.
- 12th January   2003: Bryan McPhail emulated the i8751 protection in Firetrap so the original version works.
-  9th January   2003: Bryan McPhail fixed the erratic coin inputs in the i8751 emulation in the Karnov driver.
- 26th December  2002: Angelo Salese simulated the i8751 protection in Birdie Try so that the game is playable, but there are some misplaced sprites in it. Bryan McPhail corrected the CPU clock speed in it.
- 31st July      2000: Guru - Dumped Karnov's i8751 MCU.
- 15th January   2000: Bryan McPhail got the two original Side Pocket romsets working by simulating the i8751 MCU.
- 25th September 1999: Nicola added Gallop to the M72 driver, but the rest of the M72 games need their i8751 MCU emulated before they work.
- 0.35b3             : Simulated the 8751 protection in F-1 Dream [Eric Hustvedt].
- NOTES: i8751 (C8751H-88) is read protected. The Mad Gear PCB has an unused pad on the board for an i8751 (trivia for the DEV). Protection simulation (drivers\m72.c): Most of the games running on this board have an 8751 protection MCU. It is not known how it works in detail, however it's pretty clear that it shares RAM at b0000-b0fff. On startup, the game writes a pattern to the whole RAM, then reads it back expecting it to be INVERTED. If it isn't, it reports a RAM error. If the RAM passes the test, the program increments every byte up to b0ffb, then calls a subroutine at b0000, which has to be provided by the MCU. It seems that this routine is not supposed to RET, but instead it should jump directly to the game entry point. The routine should also write some bytes here and there in RAM (different in every game); those bytes are checked at various points during the game, causing a crash if they aren't right. Note that the program keeps incrementing b0ffe while the game is running, maybe this is done to keep the 8751 alive. We don't bother with that. Finally, to do the ROM test the program asks the MCU to provide the correct values. This is done only in service, so doesn't seem to be much of a protection. Here we have provided the correct crcs for the available dumps, of course there is no guarantee that they are actually good. All the protection routines below are entirely made up. They get the games running, but they have not been derived from the real 8751 code.

- 18th November  2003: David Haywood emulated the Philips 87c52 MCU in Cookie and Bibi 2. And More More plus doesn't point the vectors there but does have a jump there in the code. See hyperpac for an example, the protection data for that game was extracted from the bootleg.
- 12th November  2003: David Haywood emulated the protection (87c52) in Hatch Catch, so it's now fully playable with sound.
- NOTES: The Intel or Philips 8752 MCU is read protected, the code can't be dumped. The following games uses the I8752 MCU (MCU code can't be dumped): snowbros.c - hyperpac, twinkle, toppyrap, moremore, moremorp, 3in1semi, cookbib2, cookbib3 and finalttr.

P6.C   87C751
- 26th September 2005: Pierpaolo Prazzoli - Emulated OKI6295 sound in Power Balls (Super Slam conversion). The Philips 87C751 sound MCU wasn't read-protected (=> s87c751.bin).
- 0.95u2             : Quench improved Super Slam audio MCU simulation.
-  1st February  2004: Quench simulated the OKI6295 sound CPU (Signetics 87C751) in Super Slam, but it's not perfect yet.
- NOTES: The 87C751 is a 8051 based MCU (DIP24) with 2k x8 OTP EPROM and 64k x8 SRAM.
- NOTES: MCU 87C751 simulation: A table converts commands sent from the main CPU, into sample numbers played back by the sound processor. All commentry and most sound effects are correct, however the music tracks may be playing at the wrong times. Accordingly, the commands for playing the samples is just a guess: 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, 60, 61, 62, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 6B, 6C. Samples 63, 64 and 6A are currently not fitted anywhere. Note that samples 60, 61 and 62 combine to form a music track. Ditto for samples 65, 66, 67 and 68. Command 29 is fired when the game is completed successfully. It requires a melody from bank one to be playing, but we're already using the bank one melody during game play. The sound CPU simulation can only be perfected once it can be compared against a real game board.

The chip is configured by placing a small smt zero Ohm resistor across 2 pads adjacent to pin35. So a romless condition can be easily checked by looking to see if the resistor is present. If the resistor is not present, EA is configured to HIGH and the chip is using it's internal ROM.

P7.3   Konami ESC
-  4th May       2003: Acho A. Tang submitted a major improvement to the Konami GX driver, improving the graphics emulation and emulating the ESC protection in Salamander 2, Dragoon Might and Tokimeki Memorial Puzzle-dama, making them all playable.
- NOTES: Konami ESC (E Security Chip) protection chip. The ESC is a custom microcontroller with external SRAM connected to it. It's microprogram is uploaded by the host game. The ESC has complete DMA access to the entire 68020 address space, like most Konami protection devices. Most games use the same or a compatible microprogram. This program gathers the sprite information scattered around work RAM and builds a sprite list in sprite RAM which is properly sorted in priority order. The Japanese version of Gokujou Parodius contains a 68020 version of this program at 0x2a285c. The code below is almost a direct translation into C of that routine. Salamander 2 uses a different work RAM format and a different ESC program, and Dragoon Might uses a third format and program. These games haven't been reverse-engineered yet and so have no sprites. Winning Spike and the Type 4 games use a new protection chip made from a Xilinx FPGA. See type4_prot_w for details.

P8.    Microchip PIC-MCU

- 0.183              : Fixes for PIC16C5x writes with the status register as destination: Write all bits except TO and PD, thus enabling e.g. bcf, bsf or clrf to change the flags. rlf and rrf must update the flags after the store to work correctly on this register [Luca Elia]. Small PIC16C5x update, correct savestates. Added PIC1655. Removed unused MCFG_PIC16C5x_T0_CB callbacks. Added RTCC pin (not called T0, plus it was implemented in reverse). Fixed RTCC clocking in sleep mode and potentially clocking it too fast. Added basic support for the old GI PIC1650 and PIC1655. Made RTCC (aka T0CKI) pin an inputline handler. Added alias for RTCC pin (Note: In the mid-90s RTCC was renamed to T0CKI) [hap].
- 0.180              : Changed the PIC16C5x disassembler to use 'std::ostream &' internally [Nathan Woods].
- 0.179              : Added virtual for consistency [cpu\pic16c5x\pic16c5x.h].
- 0.160              : Removed PIC16 MCU fake I/O memory map in bingor.c, blackt96.c, drgnmst.c, kickgoal.c, megaphx.c, midzeus.c and playmark.c [hap].
- 0.154              : Fixed the hand modified PIC16C57 code for Hot Mind and Lucky Boom (Hard Times hardware) so they correctly handle the OKI banking and work on the real hardware (cpu\pic16c5x\pic16c5x.c) [Quench].
- 0.150              : Modernized PIC16C5x cpu core [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.134              : Quench fixed the PIC16C5x CPU T0CKI count input being controlled by the wrong edge sensing.
- 0.133u5            : PIC16C5x CPU core fixes [Quench] Indirect addressing was not taking into account special purpose memory mapped locations. 'iorlw' instruction was saving the result to memory instead of the W register. 'tris' instruction no longer modifies Port-C on PIC models that do not have Port-C implemented.
- 0.128u6            : Pointer-ified the PIC16C5x core [Quench].
- 0.109u5            : Aaron Giles converted the pic16c5x disassemblers to the new format and added step in/out support where it was obvious.
- 0.79u2             : Quench updated the PIC16C5x CPU core to support internal memory maps, and he updated the relevant drivers to use the functionality as well.
- 0.78u4             : CPUs with an implicit address shift (e.g., the TMS34010 shifts addresses right 3 bits; the TMS32031 shifts addresses left 2 bits) now automatically get that shift applied to addresses in their memory maps and in calls to install_memory_read/write_handler(). This eliminates many ugly macros in the memory maps. Affected CPU cores are the ADSP210x, CCPU, PIC16C5x, TMS3201x, TMS3202x, TMS32031, and TMS340x0. Note that the CPU cores themselves still need to pass shifted values to the core read/write routines. All drivers using these cores have had their icky macros and bitshifts removed. * Harvard architecture CPUs now have data memory fully implemented now. Affected CPUs are the ADSP210x, TMS3201x, TMS3202x, PIC16C5x, and CCPU. All cores have been modified to fully split program and data memory. All drivers using these cores now specify explicit program and data memory maps. This also gets rid of a ton of ugly macros used in memory maps [Aaron Giles].
- 0.78               : Aaron Giles added support for Biofreaks, fixed remaining issues in California Speed, verified California Speed HDD dump (works in self test, not in boot ROM test), fixed timer change that broke Blitz 2000 and added proper PIC IDs for Wayne Gretzky and Mace. Added sound auto acknowledgement option, added new PIC mapping for Gauntlet: Dark Legacy and fixed initial sound IRQ state. DCS: Fixed reporting of input full/output empty states.
- 0.77u3             : Aaron Giles fixed several minor bugs that affected Biofreaks and California Speed and increased default visible area to handle Biofreaks. Tweaked the Midway PIC handling so that Biofreaks can read its serial number. Correct audio ADSP2115 CPU2 clock speed to 16MHz and graphics resolution to 512x400.

P9.1   M5074x
- 0.155              : Added machine\namcomcu.c/h. Memory system and Namco improvements [Alex Jackson]: Explicit regions in address maps (AM_REGION) are now looked up relative to the device rather than as siblings when in an internal address map (similar to devices and shared pointers)  Besides being more orthogonal than before, this allows internal ROMs of MCUs and similar devices to be hooked up in a nicer and more foolproof way. Updated the m37710 and m5074x (m6502 derivative) to take advantage of this. Divided the M37702/M37710 into specific models, with each model having its own internal address map containing the correct amounts of internal RAM and ROM. M37702 MCUs found on various Namco PCBs are now all unique devices and have their respective internal ROMs loaded as device ROMs. Also did some spring (fall) cleaning in addrmap.c/memory.c/dimemory.c. m_devbase (the base device used for tagmap lookup when late-binding handlers and finding memory regions and shares) is now a reference rather than a pointer, since we know what it is when the address_map_entry is constructed and it doesn't change (it depends solely on whether it's an entry in an MCFG-provided address map or an internal one) And for the same reason, there's now only one m_devbase per address_map_entry rather than individual copies for read/write/setoffset/sharedptr. Removed mysterious unused address_map_entry member "m_region_string", along with a silly assert probably left over from when Aaron was replacing AM_BASE with AM_SHARE years ago. Added a comment noting that "make sure all devices exist" in device_memory_interface::interface_validity_check() actually does nothing, like the proverbial goggles. The reason there's just a comment and not a fix is I haven't figured out how to fix it yet (is it possible to extract the original device tag that was given to a proto-delegate? [Alex Jackson].

P10.    Motorola

P10.1   M68701

- 0.90               : Nicola Salmoria updated the Bubble Bobble driver. Removed the 68705 CPU emulation, since that's not what the original used, simulated the 68701 MCU (enemy movement should now be correct), fixed clock item behaviour (now enemies start moving again after 10 seconds), supported coin lockout and emulated the boblbobl protection device (getting rid of the ROM patches).
- NOTES: The Motorola M68701 is a microcontroller with 2K internal ROM and read protected. The original Bubble Bobble board has a 68701 protection MCU, which hasn't been read. Its behaviour is simulated and should be a good approximation but not 100% accurate.
- NOTES: KiKi KaiKai uses a custom 68701 MCU which isn't dumped. The bootleg Knight Boy replaces it with a 68705. The bootleg is NOT 100% equivalent to the original (a situation similar to Bubble Bobble): collision detection is imperfect, the player can't be killed by some enemies. I think the bootleggers put the custom MCU in a test rig, examined its bus activity and replicated the behaviour inaccurately because they coudln't figure it all out. Indeed, the 68705 code reads all the memory locations related to the missing collision detection, but does nothing with them.



P10.2   M68705

- 0.183              : Confirmed MC68705R3 bootstrap program matches Bouncing Balls (Adult) M68705R3 [brizzo]. Hook up protection MCU in clone Bouncing Balls (Adult), added to parent set as BAD_DUMP. Note: Uses a similar scheme to Pushman, but doesn't use port D on the MCU, and uses the same endianness for MCU reads/writes (Pushman swaps the bytes on writes). As an aside, Bouncing Balls has at least partial nudity in it as seen in attract mode, although less than clone Bouncing Balls (Adult). Fixed problem with edge case in 68705 timer overflow interrupt. This fixed the missing enemies in the second stage of Xain'd Sleena [Vas Crabb].
- 0.182              : Added cpu\m6805\m68705.cpp/h and machine\taito68705interface.cpp/h. Taito 68705 refactoring (40love.cpp, bigevglf.cpp, bking.cpp, bublbobl.cpp, buggychl.cpp, flstory.cpp, lkage.cpp, lsasquad.cpp, msisaac.cpp, nycaptor.cpp and slapfght.cpp). Moved 68705 timer logic out of Arkanoid driver and into 68705 core [David Haywood]. Improvements to I/O emulation in new MC68705 device: All internal memory handlers are now private members. DDRs zeroed when device reset (as per datasheet). Port writes no longer transmit bits not set in DDR. DDR updates may cause port bits to be written out (this is important). Added external read/write handlers for ports [AJR]. Refactoring and improvements: Moved 68705 devices into their own file. Made P3, P5 and U3 variants and made them load bootstrap ROMs. Implemented EPROM control (write is stubbed out with a logerror). Implemented differences for open drain I/O ports. Base device with peripherals should really derive from the 6805 device directly, not the 68705 devices, as I/O ports are present on mask devices (e.g. 6805P2).  All drivers and devices that were using M68705_NEW have been changed to M68705P5 - someone who knows the drivers better should fix them up. Fixed pushed input ports, implement EPROM write (not saved yet). Save EPROM contents using NVRAM mechanism. Disassemble memory addresses symbolically. Re-implement timer/counter. Support MOR-controlled mode. Correct count direction. Correct startup and reset states. Exposed more more internal registers through the state interface. Shows contents of registers that can't be read by program code. Completely eliminate the concrete 68705-without-peripherals class. Added logmacro.h inspired by Edstrom's log macros (emu\logmacro.h). Added lots of logging to help trace issues. Taito 68705 interface improvements: Moved stuff arkanoid/puzznic have in common with other games to new abstract base class. Got rid of the unnecessary hacks for Big Event Golf, it doesn't need anything special. Moved Xain'd Sleena M68705 stuff to the common interface class. Fixed regressions in tokio and daikaiju. Started instantiating common device finders with the devices to marginally improve build/link time. Use common Taito 68705 interface device in Mania Challenge and clone. Removed non-obvious mcu_status_r and semaphore_r members and move to drivers (varies by system). Slap Fight M68705 functionality can be safely folded into base class so do so. Removed leftover crud from driver state classes. ddragon.cpp, qix.cpp, stfight.cpp, taitosj.cpp, bub68705, changela and pipeline use new MC68705P3 core. Renegade use common Taito 68705 hookup. mexico86 use new MC68705P3 core, simulate synchronous latches better. ADC is stubbed out with logerror (pipeline doesn't use it at all). Bootstrap ROM is believed to be identical to U3 but need to confirm. Quiz Punch use new MC68705P5 core, MCU now gets timer interrupts correctly [Vas Crabb].
- 0.181              : Start putting some 68705 functionality in the CPU core rather than copy+pasted in all the drivers. As this is a lengthy task I've created a derived CPU type with the new functionality to aid in the process without disrupting existing drivers that haven't yet been updated. Started with Alcon/Slap Fight, Guardian, Tiger Heli and Tokio / Scramble Formation [David Haywood].

- 25th May       1999: Tatsuyuki Satoh sent in a preliminary Chack'n Pop driver, but it doesn't really work since the MCU (68705) rom image is missing. Marco Cassili fixed some dips from the Exidy driver.
- 0.35b3             : Nicola Salmoria properly emulated the 68705 protection in The Electric Yo-Yo, Kram, Space Dungeon, Zoo Keeper. And make support for the ORIGINAL version of Bubble Bobble, with 68705 code from a pirate board. Wizards *do* throw stones in this version.
- 0.34b1             : Nicola Salmoria made the original Elevator Action now works, using the 68705 MCU ROM which was missing. Since there is one additional CPU to emulate, it is slower than the bootleg version. Also replaced Front Line with the complete set containing the 68705 code. It still doesn't work though.

P11.    Namco

P11.1   Cxx

-  4th January   2006: Charles MacDonald - Some information is needed about the M37702 MCUs used in various Namco games. If anyone can help, the following needs to be determined: Which games use the C71, C72, or C73 chips. Which games use the C77 (or higher numbered) chip. What we know so far is: C68  = System 2 (Final Lap 3, Suzuka 8 Hours) + System 21, C69  = NA-1 (World Court Tennis), C70  = NA-2 (Quiztou, Numan Athletics), C71  = System 22 (Master TMS32025 DSP BIOS), C72  = ?, C73  = Found on a test board, but used in any games?, C74  = System 22, C75  = NB-1 (Nebulas Ray) + NB-2 (Out Foxies) + System FL and C76  = System 11 (Xevious 3D/G). In the interim I've been examining the BIOS and working on a better trojan as well as figuring out how hardware on the MCU side works. So far adapting the NA-1 trojan for the C70 chip has not worked, but given the many similarities to C69 I feel a solution is not far off. It looks like all the System 2 games that have C68 do not use the external program ROM socket. Do any System 21 games use it, if such a socket is present? Updated the chip list based on information from Justin (thanks for the PCB pic!), Kayama, Fujix, Oliver, Guru and R. Belmont.
- 19th July      2004: R. Belmont - The Namco sound MCUs (Systems 11, 22, NB-1, NB-2, FL) are read-protected. So we're moving on to plan B. The screenshot is from MAME (trojan program) - if it runs properly on real hardware we'll be able to use it to dump the internal ROMs from all the C7x series sound MCUs. Don't get too excited though, it hasn't even been verified to boot on a real PCB yet.


P11.2   C68

- 19th September 2006: Charles MacDonald - Thanks to ogoun and Stiletto the Namco C68 MCU has been positively identified as a M37450 and I now have some documentation for it. I modified an existing PC-Engine USB / flash memory card I made to interface with the MCU (hooking up through the EPROM and PAL sockets) which has allowed some experiments to be run, but didn't result in the internal ROM being dumped. There are plenty of other things to try - one big advantage is that external memory can be mapped into the stack range (due to limited on-chip RAM) which may allow for a stack overflow technique to be used. Currently I am working on some better development hardware for the 68000 side so I can have external control of the dual port RAM the MCU has access to.
- 24th July      2006: Charles MacDonald - When I was working on the C69 MCU found in the Namco NA-1 hardware, it came to my attention that later Namco System 2 boards had a C68 MCU instead of the HD63705 which earlier revisions used. It seemed reasonable to assume Namco used a M37702 as well considering the C68 and C69 are physically identical. I had picked up two Suzuka 8 Hours boards to examine the C68 and see what possibilities there were for trojaning it. The MCU interface is virtually unchanged for the C68 compared to the previous System 2 boards, except for some slightly different connections and a new address decoding PAL. However the C68 pinout doesn't match any of the M377xx series. After disassembling some of the external program ROM dumps used by the C68 in a few games, investigation of the code shows it's actually a Mitsubishi 740 series based MCU, which is a 6502 core with extra instructions and features. Of course when Mitsubishi's microprocessor division was transferred to Renesas, they dropped support (and documentation!) of the older chips. I was able to reverse engineer the PAL outputs to put together the original equations and come up with a memory map, as well as make a partial pinout of the C68. However, I need some help locating a datasheet (user manual) for it, and I don't know the official part number. The C68 is a 100-pin QFP plastic chip, rectangular in shape with pin counts of 24, 16, 24, and 16 pins going around the perimeter from pin 1. The part has a date marking of 1991. While there are many modern parts that are similar to this chip, most of them are for USB or LED segment drivers and do not have an external address/data bus, which the C68 does. The 3806 group of the 740 series, particularly the M38063M6-XXXFP seems like a very close match, but the pins are shifted around. I already have the 740 software manual (e740sum.pdf). Feature-wise, it has eight analog channels, possibly 6 or more I/O ports (going by Mitsubishi's nomenclature, ports 0,1,2 are the data, address low, address high buses, and ports 3,4,5 are used for general I/O), internal RAM of at 256 to 512 bytes at $0000-007F/$0100-013F, and internal mask ROM of an unknown size. Another unusual feature is that the SFRs are at $D0-$FF instead of $00-$3F which may help in identifying it. In the following pinout, the address/data buses, CNVss, and analog converter channel inputs have to match whatever chip is being looked at as a potential candidate, the others are not critical. I've been through everything I can find at the Renesas website and in my collection of manuals, so I'm fairly sure the C68 corresponds to a part that is no longer in production or supported. If anyone has any tips or ideas about which chip this part is based on, I'd certainly like to hear your suggestions! I'm looking forward to writing code for the C68 as I've been wanting to work with the 740 series chips for a while now. And hopefully, a method to read the internal ROM can be figured out.
- 11th January   2006: Charles MacDonald - I recently purchased two Suzuka 8 Hours PCBs (Namco System 2) and will see what can be done about trojaning the M37702-based C68 custom chip used on it. This would be helpful for System 2 and System 21 games. Also I'd like to take a closer look at the alternate type of video hardware this game has, since there seem to be some minor emulation issues in MAME.
- NOTES: System 2 (Final Lap 3, Suzuka 8 Hours) and System 21 use the C68

P11.3   C69 (M37702)

- 0.186              : Changed name 'C69 (M37702)' to 'Namco C69 (M37702)'.
- 0.155              : Added machine\namcomcu.c/h. Memory system and Namco improvements [Alex Jackson]: Explicit regions in address maps (AM_REGION) are now looked up relative to the device rather than as siblings when in an internal address map (similar to devices and shared pointers)  Besides being more orthogonal than before, this allows internal ROMs of MCUs and similar devices to be hooked up in a nicer and more foolproof way.

-  6th May       2006: Charles MacDonald - Guru kindly sent another NA-2 board for me to work with. I've got the NA-1 USB hardware hooked up to it and have tried running some of the C69 trojans as well as new programs to figure out what's going on. Namco did a good job patching up the holes in the C69's security. ;) I'm sure in time the C70 can be dumped.
- 11th January   2006: Charles MacDonald - Progress on the C70 trojan has temporarily halted. After Guru had run a bunch of tests to help determine what was going on, it appears that the MCU commands used by the C69 trojan are implmented as do-nothing functions in the C70, so it isn't possible to simply upload code or do a memory transfer in the opposite direction to read the internal ROM out. Luckily, Guru has offered to send a NA-2 board for me to experiment with, and hopefully some methods for reading the internal ROM can be derived from the C69 BIOS which may apply to the C70.

- 11th June      2006: R. Belmont - Spent most of the day pulling apart the music player in the Namco NA-1 (C69) BIOS looking for exploits we can use to trojan the C70. Unfortunately, unlike the later players, there isn't a wide open opcode that'll do it for us, but I still have many other ideas.

- 0.104u2            : Updates to the Namco System 22 driver [R. Belmont]: Necessary changes to System 22 games to use the real C74 BIOS for music/sound. Added system controller register to boot the C74. Speedup cheat for the CPU board C74. Promoted Ace Driver from NO_SOUND to IMPERFECT_SOUND.
- 17th January   2006: R. Belmont - Phil Stroffolino was able to trojan and dump the BIOSes from the C71 3D math engine (actually a TMS32c025) and the C74 sound/inputs MCU (actually an M37702). The C74 is a bit more interesting. Unlike Super System 22, which has one M37710 (37710 and 37702 are the same MCU, just '02 has an internal ROM and '10 boots externally like a normal CPU), original System 22 has 2 M37702s (C74) with identical internal BIOSes. Based on the state of one of the MCU's inputs, the BIOS boots one of 2 different programs. The first one, intended for the C74 on the I/O board, reads all the inputs, massages them, and transmits them via the MCU's built-in serial port to the second MCU. The second MCU recieves the data via it's own serial port, puts that in shared RAM for the 68020 to see, and handles all the sound and music duties.
-  3rd January   2006: R. Belmont - Charles MacDonald has trojaned the MCU BIOS for Namco NA-1. Primarily this means correct emulated sound and music as opposed to the current (very good) simulation. I'm working on hooking everything up in MAME properly right now. And yes, this can also be considered proof of concept for trojaning other troublesome Namco MCUs (including System 11, 22, NB-1/NB-2, and FL) although the specific method won't quite apply.
-  2nd January   2006: Charles MacDonald - I've been running tests on the Namco NA-1 hardware over the last few days, and figured out how to dump the internal ROM of the M37702 MCU used in Super World Court. The BIOS has a function where code can be copied from the 68000 side over to MCU RAM and executed, making it quite insecure. I wrote a program that copies a portion of the M37702 memory to shared RAM, and the 68000 can change and run the program in a loop to read any part of the MCU address space. I think the same technique will work for other NA-1 games; at least what I've seen in MAME is that a number of them also upload code fragments for the MCU to use. For other types of Namco hardware that use the M37702, it's highly dependant on what services the MCU makes available. Also, now that the BIOS can be examined and user code can be executed on the MCU side for testing, maybe the NA-1 sound hardware (integrated in the multiple purpose 219 chip) will get figured out. Though the existing simulation of the NA-1 sound hardware is remarkably good.

- 10th August    2006: R. Belmont - On the trojan front, the 68020 side runs well on the PCB, but I've had some issues getting the MCU to cooperate. And at 20 minutes erase time per EPROM the turnaround is pretty nasty (I don't know how Guru puts up with it). Still, onwards we go...
-  6th August    2006: R. Belmont - Finally getting somewhere on the C75 trojan. I found a great universal cross-assembler and wrote a 68020 assembly program based on the startup/diagnostic code from Mach Breakers since that's the PCB I have to play with. Finally I've come up with a program that works to my satisfaction in MAME. Next comes actually trying it on the PCB, but since it's mostly unaltered Namco code it hopefully shouldn't be too problematic.

-  3rd September 2008: Guru - Since a few people were interested, here's a small Guru-treat about the C76 dumping process. The first pic is an overall view of the Namco NB-1 PCB. The second pic shows a close-up of the C76 that has been surface mounted onto the PCB. Astute MAME'ers will know that normally in that location on a Namco NB-1 PCB is a C75 chip. The C76 is just the same type of Mitsubishi M37702 microcontroller with a different internal ROM. If you look closely you can see the number '24' written on it, showing it's the chip that I tagged to be decapped on my Decapping Page. The decapping is no longer required, of course. The third pic shows the two 27C4096 EPROMs that have been re-programmed with the trojan code and the on-board 2k EEPROM that we're using to save the data. The EEPROM is simply read with any common EPROM programmer to get the C76 code that we put there using the trojan. There were a couple of issues here. First, the C76 interface is different to the C75 so it took a few tries before the trojan would run on this PCB (if you've been paying attention you'll know the C76 normally sits on a Namco System 11 PCB). Secondly, and unfortunately, the C76 ROM is 16k so I needed to adjust the trojan code manually by changing the memory start point then repeating the process 8 times to get a full dump of the C76 ROM (at c000, c800, d000, d800, e000, e800, f000, f800). This also involves blanking EPROMs 8 times too. Thanks again to Olivier Galibert for figuring it all out.

- NOTES: RP5H01 = Ricoh 64x1bit(+8bit) PROM with 6/7-bit counter (=>16 bytes security data). In reality, PROM data is 72bits (64 + 8bit 'dummy'). In 7-bit counter mode, from 64 to 127 (%1000000 to %1111111), the dummy bits are read repeatedly, with a mask of %1010111. For example if the 8 dummy bits are $7c, bits 64 to 127 are read as $7c $7c $00 $00 $7c $7c $00 $00. To simplify this, our emulation expects 'overdumps', 128bits total.

P15.1   Sega encryption

- 0.147u3            : Minor doc update: Added the Super Locomotive encrypted Z80 part number (machine\segacrpt.c) [Brian Troha].
-  4th May       2005: As you might already have seen on Haze's WIP, yesterday I succeeded in decrypting Gardia and Space Position. This was an interesting case of pieces falling into place rapidly one after another. The first piece was the decryption of Calorie Kun, thanks to a decrypted bootleg which was recently found. This didn't look like a particolarly interesting breakthrough at the moment: the encryption algorythm was already known, the key would have been difficult to find by hand but with the reference of the bootleg it could be derived automatically in a few minutes - just the time to write a program. This renewed my interest in the remaining Sega encrypted games that use this algorithm, in particular Gardia. David Widel revealed that he had decrypted a portion of it months ago, but got stuck and put aside the results without publishing them. Believe it or not, he decrypted most of the code by comparing it with My Hero - even if that's a completely different game, it shares a lot of almost identical code with Gardia. The data David provided was very useful to get started. Another really useful coincidence was that we have two sets of Gardia (one supposedly being a bootleg, but still encrypted). The two sets are different versions, with code shifted by a few bytes in places. This is an ideal situation when decrypting games that use simple algorithms like this one. When you have decrypted a portion of code in one set, you can use it to decrypt the same portion of code in the other set; but this way you also automatically decrypt some more code in the second set, which is still encrypted in the first set, so you can go back to the first set and decrypt even more code, and so on - you slowly build up the two keys in parallel. While I was doing this, I rapidly noticed that the key used by the second set for opcodes was identical to the one used by the first set for data. Shortly afterwards, I also noticed that the key used by the second set for data was identical to the one used by the first set for opcodes - just shifted by one byte. At that point I was on the lookout; I have to admit that I didn't notice it immediately, but eventually I discovered that the keys were actually the same as Calorie Kun, apart from the shift. When I found that, I just copied the whole Calorie Kun keys and I was almost finished - Gardia booted but had some problems. I just had to find a few more bytes at the end of the key to fix them. Space Position was the easiest of all. At that point I was almost sure it would have used the same key. I checked some bytes of the partial key I had manually derived years ago, matched them with the known key, copied over the data with the appropriate shift, launched the game, and it was already working, on the first try - apart from the emulation issues which Haze later fixed. This completes the decryption of all currently known Sega games using the "easy" Z80 encryptions. Unfortunately there are a few encrypted Z80 games left, using the suicide MC8123 CPU, which might be lost forever: all boards using the CPU seem to be dead, and the key is just about impossible to find without an hardware attack.
-  4th May       2005: David Haywood - Nicola decrypted Space Position however it doesn't work correctly in the current driver as it uses the hardware in a slightly different way to Angel Kids. I've started fixing the driver, the first fix was using different roms for the upper / lower tilemap (In Angel Kids both tilemaps have identical roms so it was impossible to tell which set was for which tilemap). With this fix the title screen looks good. The sprites may need drawing in reverse order, or a priority bit may be missing / handled incorrectly. There is currently no sound. Update: Fixed sound and hang when game starts due to main CPU requiring a response from the sound CPU. Fixed sprite drawing and added controls. Game seems to be fully playable.
- 0.96               : Nicola Salmoria cleaned up sega Z80 encryption code.
- 0.34b1             : Added machine\segacrpt.c. Nicola Salmoria moved the Sega encryption code, used by Flicky, Future Spy and many others, to machine\segacrpt.c.
- NOTES: Several Sega Z80 games have program ROMs encrypted using a common algorithm (but with a different key). The hardware used to implement this encryption is either a custom CPU, or an  epoxy block which probably contains a standard Z80 + PALs. The encryption affects D3, D5, and D7, and depends on M1, A0, A4, A8 and A12. D0, D1, D3, D4 and D6 are always unaffected. The encryption consists of a permutation of the three bits, which can also be inverted. Therefore there are 3! * 2^3 = 48 different possible encryptions.

- 0.175              : Changed machine\raiden2cop.cpp/h to machine\seibucop\seibucop.cpp/h. Added machine\seibucop\seibucop_cmd.hxx and seibucop_dma.hxx. Cleaning up the Seibu COP (Co-Processor) device and documentation. Moved DMA and commands into own files. Prevent cop_angle to overflow byte range. Fixes III to I quadrant movements in Legionnaire and Heated Barrel. Fixes stage clear player movement in Legionnaire, level 4 boss and maybe access exceptions in Heated Barrel. Moved zsorting to DMA file, improved notes [Angelo Salese]. Added nicer sorting routine [O. Galibert].
- 0.157              : Endian safety fix (machine\raiden2cop.c) [Alex Jackson].
- 0.155              : Changed machine\seibu_cop.c/h to machine\raiden2cop.c/h. Added COP 0x6200 command to Raiden 2 driver [O. Galibert]. Ported OG's fix in M68k based games to machine\seicop.c. 'Seibu Cup Soccer' players now turns around right, at the expense of being mostly without the head (!). 'SD Gundam Sangokushi' has less erratic Homing Missiles and third mid-boss doesn't go to wonderland anymore. Updated 0205 for M68k based games. Experiment with the bootleg. Fixed radar for Seibu Cup Soccer (machine\seicop.c) [Angelo Salese]. Reworked the Seibu Cup Soccer debug mode code so that it can be enabled for all sets rather than just the non-functional bootlegs, also documented how you get the Olympic Soccer '92 title screen and disable a debug display in the Cup Soccer Selection sets. The COP could be involved in providing a rom overlay for this area. Added palette DMA (RAM to private buffer) to all Seibu Cop games. Moved some of the Raiden 2 COP emulation to a new device (just the memory DMA stuff, including private buffer copy code) and started sharing it with legionna.c in order to avoid code duplication. We can slowly move other duplicate code over too and eventually kill the old seicop.c. De-duplicate seicop table upload code. Use common collision logic that appears to work for all games using the same commands, tested r2 etc. and 2nd boss still works (machine\raiden2cop.c) [David Haywood].
- 0.153              : Converted machine\seibu_cop.c to DEVCB2 [Osso].
- 0.152              : Converted mame\machine\seicop.c to a device. Eventually it should be merged with emu\machine\seibu_cop [Osso].
- 0.147u1            : Added Seibu COP 0x1c param to 0x0205 command, fixes at least sprite positioning during intros of Raiden 2 and Zero Team (but breaks gameplay in Zero Team, needs investigation). Made Seibu COP 0x42c2 command more accurate, makes Legionnaire enemies to behave properly and match finally starts in Seibu Cup Soccer [Angelo Salese, Smitdogg]. Fixed rounding error on 0x42c2. Ported 0x42c2 to raiden2.c, helps with ship entry, respawn and power-up movements. Added command 0x6200 note. Added 0xe38e command, used by Seibu Cup Soccer to follow the ball. Quick and dirty porting of R2 opcode table into M68k based games. Added reg/off for unknown opcodes. Check-point (seibu_cop_io, seibu_cop_device). Made default base to be 0x400. DMA hooked up (machine\seibu_cop.c) [Angelo Salese]. Experimental collision detection [David Haywood].
-  1st October   2012: Angelo Salese - The COP Diary #3:
                       #15 Advanced Hit Test: With this we tried to understand better the collision detection, by repeately poll the collision ports but it didn't gave reasonable results. Amusingly, if you don't clear the unused data of the collision table it will give complete garbage.
                       #16 Purple Laser Test: a.k.a. test for 0x6200 COP macro, used by various games to calculate angle direction according to a fixed function. This is used by Raiden 2 purple laser, chopper (first enemies ) facing direction, SD Gundam homing weapon and 3rd level mid-boss direction (and probably others too). We now do know that the algo does some corrections to the result in particular circumstances, discovering what these are is the next goal.
                       #17 Ext Pin Test: In Legionnaire program code there's a weird r/w access to an I/O port in range 0x700-0x7ff while polling bit 13 of the external port (0x470), then it puts the results of this weird read to some work RAM addresses that are never readed-back by the program itself. We tried to read the contents of this while doing the exact same thing as Legionnaire, but it just returned 0xffff. So it's very likely to be a development left-over (either debugging device or a feature of the game that was discarded at some point).
                       #18 OBJ Y Test: This tested video register 0x644. The test confirmed that is a simple Y base register for sprites.
                       #19 0905/0904/0903/0902/0985/0984 Test: This checked the simplest macro (the 0x905, aka read to work RAM address X, add with RAM address Y, write the result to RAM address Z) and tried various combinations of it. 0x905 behaves normally, 0x904 (used in Zero Team and X Se Dae) definitely does a subtraction instead of an addition, 0x903/0x902 doesn't do anything and 0x985/0x984 behaves like 0x905/0x904, respectively. There's a new theory, where the COP trigger is masked with a ~0x281 value when it executes commands at 0x50x, to define what COP macro should be executed (and also explains why Seibu Cup Soccer tries to execute 0xe18e, that isn't in the uploaded table at all).
                       #20 DDE5 Test: This is used by the radar in Seibu Cup Soccer, but what we do know about it is completely wrong, so it doesn't return any result in there. It doesn't help that we still don't have a proper way to access COP registers that are above 3 (see also test #13).
                       #21 DMA 14/15 Test: This checked if the DMA is really a burst one (-> halts main CPU and takes complete control over the system). Disregard the snapshot, timings with this algo are: 0xaa1/0xaa2 for first test, 0xafb for second, 0xac6 for third and 0b1f for fourth. So the test confirmed that the DMA is really a burst one, and also that the original PCB is slighlty slower than emulation in "idle" mode (either refresh rate or waitstates). Next step is to extract the exact timings out of the DMA.
                       #22 680 Test: This test tried to check out what's the meaning of writing to port 0x680 (that is done at irq routine by all games). I've expected a full stop of the operations (so that is an irq ack) or a jumpy sprite movement (so that is a sprite buffer copy). It's neither of those, fun.
                       23 COP R/W Test/COP Read Test/Bogus R/W Test/Bogus RAM Test: This one tries to r/w the COP ports (0x100400-0x1005ff). System locks up if there's an attempt to write at 0x100430 for whatever reason. Every other register prior to that seems to be read-backable. With Bogus RAM test, it tries to check out RAM addresses 0x100000-0x1003ff. It's a normal RAM. With the Read tests instead, we tried to only do a read to these addresses, and we did two discoveries. A) default RAM pattern seems to be: if((ram_addr & 0x20) == 0x20); return 0x4141; else; return 0x0f0f. B) none of the 0x5** COP registers have default RAM values (returns either 0xffff or default state values), while all of the 0x4** all returns 0x4141 / 0x0f0f except to where I've did mods for the correct functioning of the system (so it returns back last value I've written in there).
- 18th September 2012: Angelo Salese - The COP Diary #2:
                       #5/6 Raster A/B test: This test checked if the scrolling registers applies only at DMA time or it's a post-processing effect, by changing these vregs in the middle of the frame. The oblique shape of the background indicates that it's a post-processing effect. This also proves that Godzilla has jerky scrolling due of a completely different problem (timing, perhaps?).
                       #7 Trigonometry Test: This one was a test mostly made for tuning the sine / cosine maths and the scale factor used with it. The only major difference than before is that the scale is a two bits register. It's hardly noticeable by the naked eye, but now bullet / character speeds are more accurate than before.
                       #8 Division Test: This one checked the 0x42c2 macro command functionality, but it failed miserably (returned always zero in tests). It indicates that the 0x42c2 command must be used together with the Pythagorean ones for correct functionality. It was re-tested in #12 (see below).
                       #9 Priority Test: This one checked the video priorities, via a simple "compare one layer with everything else" algorythm. I haven't yet implemented the scheme into the driver, plus it's unknown if there isn't anything nasty like a per-pen priority but we'll see.
                       #10 130e/138e test: This one checked the 0x130e/0x138e macro command (Pythagorean Theorem angle calculation). Other than some minor off by one errors (presumably due of rounding issues) and the fact that the execution of this command is mandatory for the correct functionality of 0x3b30/0x42c2 macro commands, there isn't nothing really new to talk about for this one.
                       #11 3b30/3bb0 test: This one checked Pythagorean Theorem hypotenuse length command functionality. Again, nothing really new, it's just the familiar square root(x²+y²) in binary format.
                       #12 42c2 test: This is where things gets a bit trickery. #8 proved that this macro command must be concatenated with 0x13*e/0x3b*0, so I was really curious to see what this one really does. Rather than being a simple division operation, it's a multiply/divider of the RAW hypotenuse length result. In medical terms, while 0x3bb0 returns a 16-bit value, this one takes the original value, shifts it to the left (via the scale register) then divides again the result via a RAM parameter. It also changes 0x1b2 register, it returns the number of the scale multiplication factor. This makes Legionnaire to have less cowardish enemies, even though some movements are still a bit off.
                       #13 Reg Mirror (Dummy): This test tried if the COP registers 4-7 are a mirror of 0-3 via a simple read-back (hence the "dummy" name). The test failed (returns garbage in those ports), I'll try again sooner or later. It's important to know this concept in order to understand an unclear fact regarding the COP machine code, i.e. what determines the usage of registers 4-7 in bit terms.
                       #14 0205 test: While doing this one I've studied the preliminary ASM code provided by OG and trap15 documented in the raiden2.c, and something catched my eye: there was a write (work RAM address +0x1c) that is definitely triggered by this, but it never gave noticeable result plus makes Zero Team to crash after some seconds of gameplay/attract mode. After the test run, it was clear that there is definitely an addition between +0x1c and +0x10 work RAMs. The discovery is that it seems to be a dword and not a word operation. This fixes: Raiden 2 intro (ship objects now scrolls down correctly), Zero Team intro (the scrolling was a bit off before during the bike / van chase) and Seibu Cup Soccer now Kick Offs (although the players then decides that is the right time to make a strike action and leave the poor GK alone). Unfortunately, this also breaks Zero Team gameplay again, but 0.147 was just released so I have some time to understand why it crashes even if the fix is definitely right.
- 0.147              : Added machine\seibu_cop.c/h. Understood how the Seibu COP collision detection really works, greatly improving Godzilla, Heated Barrel and SD Gundam RT gameplay [Angelo Salese, Smitdogg]. 0x588 is just a mirror of 0x580 apparently (machine\seicop.c). Improved the collision detection (still some rounding errors). Added Seibu COP protection device (seibu_cop.c). Small addendum and some notes [Angelo Salese].
- 13th September 2012: Angelo Salese - The COP Diary #1: For the four people that lives in Mars, the Seibu COP is one of the most evil system protections ever studied by mankind, and that's an understatement too. I'm doing some researches thru m68k coding and a working PCB kindly provided by Smitdogg. The researches involves ANYTHING unclear, and more I go ahead and more I do believe that the games doesn't even reach the 10% of the possible potential of the system. So, here's the results and my speculations of the currently done tests:
                       Test #1/2 Manual Collision Check / Automatic Collision Check: An hit-box is a well known basic concept of gaming. For people that doesn't know, every single object has an invisible shape (generally a rectangle for 2d) that defines its collision space. Some macro commands in COP basically calculates the hit-box for two given objects. My previous attempts of HLE this concept failed miserably, and needed 7 videos from Smitty and various mods to understand that what I was taking as a collision detection parameter is actually a relative address to another table, that's positioned after the old table. Implementing this gave way better collision detections to every single game of the system. It's still not 100% perfect, but my plan is to modify the manual test in order to return & modify this relative value on the fly. These tests also provided the meaning of 0x582/0x584 (respectively y and x distance between origin points, i.e. an hexadecimal subtraction) and then the correct bit assignment for 0x580 (bit 0: collides in Y space, bit 1: collides in X space, active low). Unknown meaning for 0x586 (it seems always 1?) and 0x588 (that seems a mirror of 0x580 but then it also sets up bit 2 and 3 for whatever reason).
                       Test #3 Check 63X: The 0x***62e-0x***63f range is a bit weird, is modified from time to time by Godzilla so for a moment I've thought that was a clipping effect register for the tilemaps. The test instead proves that these are just alternative scrolling registers, setted up in a way that presumably puts the tilemap origin at whatever top-left corner the CRTC sets up. Now, the question is: why having TWO scrolling registers? Is it a weird design choice or there's a definite difference between writing one or another register? The upcoming Raster A/B test should answer to this question.
                       Test #4 PDMA test: This test was specific to SD Gundam: according to a real PCB video that floats around the net, we are doing a full fade in/out when it should actually fade only some layers. The table used is a bit weird, and I've tried to upload the same thing to a different board (that is Legionnaire). The result? It does what is supposed to do even on real HW, so the prime suspect is that SD Gundam sets (either in SW or in HW) that specific area of the RAM in an encrypted fashion, also proved by the fact that it doesn't test it at POST and having Denjin Makai that basically does the same.
- 0.141u1            : Angelo Salese hooked up preliminary Seibu COP macro command 0x6200, used on SD Gundam Sangokushi Rainbow Tairiku Senki for the Homing weapon. Fixed Seibu COP command 0x7e05, used by Raiden DX fg video banking. Preliminary implementation of the Seibu COP palette brightness mode 4, used by Denjin Makai fade in/out effects. Work around for Seibu COP command 0x8100 / 0x8900, used in all games for direction of objects. Fixes many sync bugs in all legionna.c / raiden2.c games [Angelo Salese, Tomasz Slanina].
- 0.141              : Angelo Salese implemented a preliminary sort-DMA in Seibu COP routines, fixes sprite-sprite priorities in Seibu Cup Soccer. Fixed RAM fill in Seibu DMA COP command 0x116, allowing Godzilla to boot. Implemented palette DMA brightness algorythm mode 5 in Seibu COP games, used by Seibu Cup Soccer, Godzilla, SD Gundam Rainbow Tairiku Senki and Legionnaire for fading effects. Reimplemented scatter-gather Sprite DMA in Seibu COP used by SD Gundam Rainbow Tairiku Senki, also improving the functionality in it. Implemented preliminary Seibu COP macro command 0xdde5, used by Seibu Cup Soccer x/y radar positions. Implemented Seibu COP macro 0x905, used for ark movements in Legionnaire / Zero Team when a knock down occurs.
- 0.140u3            : Angelo Salese added DMA mode 0x0e in machine\seicop.c, used by Seibu Cup Soccer, Godzilla and SD Gundam.
- 0.138u3            : hap added COPX romloading for sets that didn't have it, marked as BAD_DUMP until the assumption that they're the same is (un)confirmed.
- 0.124u3            : Seibu implementation cleanups [David Haywood]: Added COP/Heated Barrel ram clear stuff. Tried to make COP a bit more generic, breaks a few things for now, but better than duplicated code all over the place.
- 0.124u2            : Seibu COP cleanup, primarily sorting the code and identifying similarities in different implementations [David Haywood].
-  7th April     2008: David Haywood - I've decided to dust off the Seibu protection stuff Kale was working on and take a look at that. It's a complex beast to say the least, and quite whether I'll be able to emulate it or not I don't know. Based on what's already been documented there appear to be multiple parts to the protection. A bunch of registers, Some maths operations, DMA operations, a 'Macro' table it uploads and can trigger which can perform other sequenced, complex protection operations on a per game basis, and an external rom 'COPX-01? or 'COPX-02? which is probably used for lookups on some of the maths operations. It looks like the protection device is integrated into the system controller and can access anything on the board. This is of course all undocumented, and figuring it out from guesswork alone isn't easy. I'm currently pondering over the possibility of running some test code on the boards but the interaction with the protection devices (uploading of tables etc.) is vast, complex and very subtle in places so it's hard to know what to test, especially as it's hard to know where in ram to look for results. There is also a later revision of the MCU using external rom 'COPX-03' which is used on the V33 based "New Zero Team" and "New Raiden 2", however, this MCU seems to be a completely different beast, unrelated to the previous generation. In those cases the games upload a much larger amount of data to the MCU device, maybe the entire program, but it looks to be encrypted. I'm not making any promises that there will be any progress on any of thsee games, but rest assured, they are being looked at, they haven't been forgotten, they're just *hard*, really hard, especially the non-68k based ones which have additional banking issues to worry about.
- NOTES: The Raiden 2 hardware games use the 2nd (and 3rd) generation of Seibu's 'COP' protection, utilizing the external 'COPX_D2' and 'COPX_D3' lookup roms (probably for math operations)  These chips, marked (c)1992 RISE Corp. are not thought to be the actual MCU which is probably internal to one of the Seibu customs.

- 0.80u2             : Quench fixed some problems with the 32010 update. Cycle counts for invalid opcodes 7F1E and 7F1F are now 0.
- 0.80               : Quench added internal data memory map to the TMS32010 CPU core and fixed overflow in the ADDH instruction. Adjustments for TMS32010 internal data map in Twin Cobra / Wardner, Toaplan1 and Hard Drivin'.
- 0.78u4             : CPUs with an implicit address shift (e.g., the TMS34010 shifts addresses right 3 bits; the TMS32031 shifts addresses left 2 bits) now automatically get that shift applied to addresses in their memory maps and in calls to install_memory_read/write_handler(). This eliminates many ugly macros in the memory maps. Affected CPU cores are the ADSP210x, CCPU, PIC16C5x, TMS3201x, TMS3202x, TMS32031, and TMS340x0. Note that the CPU cores themselves still need to pass shifted values to the core read/write routines. All drivers using these cores have had their icky macros and bitshifts removed. * Harvard architecture CPUs now have data memory fully implemented now. Affected CPUs are the ADSP210x, TMS3201x, TMS3202x, PIC16C5x, and CCPU. All cores have been modified to fully split program and data memory. All drivers using these cores now specify explicit program and data memory maps. This also gets rid of a ton of ugly macros used in memory maps [Aaron Giles].

Then value stored in 400C must be xxxx1001 (rrca x 3) or else reset. 2nd protection relies on the values stored in 400A-400D matching $2690+($400E) (Starts at $460). If the values all match then it will jump to 0x0011 instead of 0x0009 (refresh instead of reset).

P19.2   Random Number Generator

- 26th January   2003: Bernd Wiebelt added a generic random number generator to the core.
- NOTES: In 99% of arcade games, a software based pseudo-random number generator is used. It's code no different from that driving the gameplay, so it's 100% accurate. The random number simulation that was added to the MAME Namco System1 driver is a hack. They read values from a special chip. It's deterministic, sometimes used for protection, and other times for pseudo-random values. The code that was added isn't based objectively on the behavior of the real cuskey, which has yet to be reverse-engineered.

P19.4   DL57S22
- NOTES: In Survival (Rock-ola 1982) there is a 14 pin part connected to the 8910 Port B D0 labeled DL57S22. There is a loop at $2002 that reads the player controls -- the game sits in this loop as long as Port B changes. Also, Port B seems to invert the input bits, and the game checks for this at $2f32. The game also uses the RIM instruction a lot, that's purpose is unclear, as the result doesn't seem to be used (even when it's stored, the result is never read again). I would think that this advances the protection chip somehow, but isn't RIM a read only operation?

P19.9   Dongle

- 0.148              : Refactor the type1 dongle code a bit, to make any future additions easier (decocass.c) [David Haywood].
-  7th July      2012: Charles MacDonald - Quite a lot of progress has been made with the Data East cassette system dumping efforts. Many different dongle types have been examined and supported, and currently all known dongle types can be dumped. Software has been developed to extract the PROM data out of dongle dumps and to perform detailed analysis of the decryption features of various dongles, and to determine internal jumper settings to see how a dongle is configured without even opening it up. A few games have been added to MAME recently and it's likely there will be more additions in the future, as we keep finding tapes and dongles to dump from generous donors.
-  5th February  2012: Charles MacDonald - The Data East cassette system uses a security dongle that is unique to each game. This prevents operators from duplicating a game simply by copying the audio data from a game cassette to a blank tape. There are several types of basic dongle designs, and each one has data that is specific to a particular game. A 6502 CPU runs the BIOS and software loaded off the tape. It can exchange command and data bytes from a 8041 MCU that controls the tape drive over a serial interface. The dongle sits between the 6502 and 8041 and can modify, replace, or pass data through unaltered during communication. A loaded program can also interrogate the dongle for additional data unrelated to the 8041 or tape contents. I've made a circuit that mimics both the 6502 and 8041 interface so all aspects of the dongle can be observed. Because some dongles also have a reset generator inside them that intializes the internal state, the dongle reader has a software-controlled power supply to force a reset condition as needed. It has been tested successfully with a so-called Type 3 dongle. This dongle has a normal operating mode and a "PROM mode" where a 4Kx8 PROM can be read out sequentially. After a reset, values written to the data and command registers and data read from the command register are not modified. Values read from the data register have bits 6 and 7 exchanged, and bit 0 is the latched value from the previous byte that was read. The 8041 normally uses commands in the 00-7F range and ignores higher values. This allows 80-FF to be used to send commands to the dongle that will not trigger any action on the tape drive. For the Type 3 dongle, writing Cx (where bits 3-0 don't matter) enables PROM mode. Now, writing any value to the command register loads bits 12-8 of a 12-bit counter and bits 3-0 are reset to zero. Reading the command register returns a byte from the PROM at the current address, then the counter is incremented by one. The counters wrap from offset FFF to zero. In this way the loaded program can read out the entire PROM content. Oddly enough the 8041 interface seems to be disabled in this mode. Writing to the data register or command register will tristate the data bus, causing the 8041 to latch an open-bus value. Likewise, reading the data register returns an open-bus value as well. There are no resistors on the BIO-8 board or in the Type 3 dongle to pull the data lines into a known state, so the actual value that is present will fluctuate. Perhaps after receiving the Cx command the 8041 knows to ignore all future communciation with the 6502. Once the power has been cycled the system and dongle will reset and normal operation resumes, with the tape drive being accessible again. Once I get some other types of dongles to experiment with I'll post an update about how they work.
- 30th January   2012: Smitdogg - Charles MacDonald just got his custom Deco Cassette dongle dumper working on one of the dongle types. There are a few different types so still a ways to go but it's working correctly on the first type added. Expect progress / new dumps over the next couple of months.
- 0.106u5            : Juergen Buchmueller added new dongle data (cexplore.pro 32 byte) to Explorer (Cassette). The dongle data is reverse engineered by table analysis.
- 0.106u3            : David Widel and Juergen Buchmueller added dongle data (TYPE1 DONGLE (DE-0061) with alternate PROM) to Highway Chase. The dongle data is reverse engineered from manual decryption - Game now playable.
- 27th May       2006: Dave Widel - I've been working on the decryption for chwy, so I haven't had any sleep for two days. I can't stop once I start working on something like this. I have ~233 out of the 256 decrypted. Usually they get easier by this point but this one seems to get harder as I near the end. UPDATE: Looks like the data in my table repeats. Juergen spotted it imediately. I have enough data already for him to solve it, looks like chwy is decrypted.
- 18th March     2006: Guru - A 984A02 dongle and a Magic Gate security dongle (Capcom/Banpresto 2003 - Namco System 256 hardware) arrived late yesterday from Japan.
- 0.99u2             : Juergen Buchmueller improved some DECO cassette games. Found bitswap for Zeroize type #3 dongle; found hack to get it running w/o the dongle ROM by debugging the game code; changed year to 1983; removed NOT_WORKING flag. Changed visible area to 240x248.
- 0.89u5             : Juergen Buchmueller added a NOP dongle (returning the data read from cassette as is) to Flying Ball - Game now playable.

P19.A   Custom security

P19.A1  Epoxy block
-  8th October   2011: Charles MacDonald - I've been running a lot of tests on Free Kick to understand how various functions of the NS6201 security module work. Here's a complete description of it: http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/txt/freekick.txt.
- PCB: Check the lizwiz.txt for: How to reading the data of 2x 2732 EPROMs in a epoxy block.
- PCB: Springer - The security CPU module is in a tin shell about 3x4 inches which is filled with epoxy, removing the epoxy exposes a Nicad, a Z80, a 6116LP RAM, a 74LS32, a 74LS05 and a 4069 plus a few diodes & resistors. The first ROM has a blank space and I assume that the RAM has program code stored in it to act as unaccessable ROM code.
- PCB: S562008 - Custom security block (battery backed) (Hardhead, SuperRanger), SUNA T568009 (HardHead2, Sparkman)


P19.A2  BBX
- NOTES: The BBX coprocessor in Shanghai Kid (Taiyo 1985) is burried in an epoxy block (1.5" by 2" by 4") and it is connected to the PCB by a 40 pin DIP socket labeled IC30. It contains a surface-mounted Z80 (TMPZ84C00P), LS245 logic IC and Fujitsu MB8464 ram (8k x 8 SRAM, external battery backed). The BBX coprocessor receives graphics and sound-related commands from the main CPU via shared RAM. It directly manages an AY8910, is responsible for populating spriteram, and forwards appropriate sound commands to the sample-playing CPU.

Added the ability to view peel18cv8 jed files to the jedutil [Kevin Eshbach].
- 0.147u3            : Added src\regtests\jedutil\jedtest.py. Converted jedtest script to Python [Andrew Gardner]. Fixed regtest, now all is executed fine [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.147u2            : Added util\plaparse.c/h. Refactored the code in jedutil to support the viewing of a GAL16V8 device and added a new command line option of "-viewlist" which will print out a list of all the devices that can be viewed in human readable logic equations. Also updated the jedutil regression test to support passing in an additional argument of "debug" to print out a detailed log. Also moved the jedutil regression test data into separate directories composed of the device's name to make things more organized [Kevin Eshbach]. Added experimental support for using Berkeley PLA files as input to jedutil [Curt Coder]. Fixed potentially uninitialized variable error in MSVC compile (tools\jedutil.c) [smf].
- 0.147              : Numerous jedutil tool improvements [Kevin Eshbach]: Made some modifications to the jedutil tool to allow the viewing of simple combinatorial jeds (adding support for registered and gals in the future) by taking a jed file and printing out human-readable equations. Changed the command line options of the jedutil tool to know take an initial argument to specify what the tool should do. For example to convert a jed to bin the command is now: jedutil -convert <source.jed> <dest.bin> and jedutil -convert <source.bin> <dest.jed>. To view a jed file with human-readable equations the command is jedutil -view <source.jed> <pal type>. Added a simple regression test for the tool that just verifies that the currently known pals have the row and column fuse location mapped correctly and at the moment this tool runs under windows only. Under the directory src\regtests\jedutil there is a Windows Script File with the name jedtest.wsf that if run from the command line with the command "cscript jedtest.wsf" will verify that a dump of the jeds in src\regtests\jedutil\jeds matches the good dumps in src\regtests\jedutil\baseline. Reference jed files created using the tool eqn2jed which is included with Opal Jr and these files are in src\regtests\jedutil\eqns (regtests\jedutil\baseline\pal10h8.txt, pal10l8.txt, pal12h6.txt, pal12l6.txt, pal14h4.txt, pal14l4.txt, pal16h2.txt, pal16l2.txt, pal16l8.txt, pal20l10.txt and pal20l8.txt), (regtests\jedutil\eqns\pal10h8.eqn, pal10l8.eqn, pal12h6.eqn, pal12l6.eqn, pal14h4.eqn, pal14l4.eqn, pal16h2.eqn, pal16l2.eqn, pal16l8.eqn, pal20l10.eqn, pal20l8.eqn and readme.txt) and (regtests\jedutil\jeds\pal10h8.jed, pal10l8.jed, pal12h6.jed, pal12l6.jed, pal14h4.jed, pal14l4.jed, pal16h2.jed, pal16l2.jed, pal16l8.jed, pal20l10.jed, pal20l8.jed and jedtest.wsf). Fixed compile error (tools\jedutil.c) [Wilbert Pol].
-  9th September 2011: Charles MacDonald - Atari GX2 protection - Atari GX2 games consist of three boards: Game board (JAMMA compatible), JSA board (Sound and some I/O) and CLARN board (Security and linking). The CLARN board has a fast board-to-board parallel link and a slower cabinet-to-cabinet serial link. Surprisingly an entire ADSP-2105 DSP is used just to manage serial communications. The parallel link consists of two identical subsystems shared across two board sets, each containing one port of a 2Kx8 dual port RAM and a 8Kx8 RAM (only 4K usable) accessed through a TPC1020 FPGA. Here's some preliminary documentation (pinouts, memory map, etc.): http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/txt/gx2tech.txt. The FPGA can't access the dual port RAM, DSP, and I/O on the board, though it may be able to snoop CPU access to them. It has the right connections to provide a 16-bit interface to the 8-bit RAM transparently. Moto Frenzy writes data into RAM and tests it frequently, doing dummy reads and other seemingly pointless operations. The FPGA keeps track of these accesses and uses it to influence data that is read back later as it can manipulate the RAM address and data bus as needed. The game depends on correct results when creating sprite lists and road data, without the CLARN board present the sprite positions and road display are corrupt making the game unplayable. The next step is to add a USB interface to the GX2 board and write 68K code to communicate with a PC. Then I can send test programs to the system and start experimenting with FPGA RAM access. Since the RAM is external, it can be monitored with a logic analyzer or even replaced with a RAM emulator (same one used in Master Boy) to capture the actual data the FPGA is working with. I'm hoping the protection has more to do with the RAM content rather than the internal state, as the FPGA has 48 bits that can be isolated from the I/O pins. The Atari GT games (T-Mek/Primal Rage) use a similar security system. The main board has an Actel A1020B FPGA connected to 8K RAM. With the RAM removed, the game runs much like it does in MAME now. The A1020B is a significantly more complex chip so it's likely the security has improved considerably. Definitely something to look at later.
-  6th December  2007: Charles MacDonald - Boolean minimization: I have been getting quite a lot of feedback about the PAL analyzer circuit. Currently it will generate the minimal equations for a given pin, and then do a term coverage check to remove intermediate equations that resulted from the minimization but should really be replaced with another one that has wider coverage of the input terms. What I didn't expect was pin polarity being an issue. One of the M92 PALs had a pin which reduced to the following mess assuming it was an active low output: *...*. Looks like some complicated logic was involved. But if we assume it's active high. As you can see the polarity you are targeting during minimization makes all the difference. As a quick way of attempting to generate the smallest set of equations possible I added a check to find which output level occurs the least for a given pin. It's also entirely possible to have a simple set of equations that generate the opposite of the desired polarity and a complex set that give the desired one. I think to keep the output of the program as human-readable as possible I will always try to generate the smallest set, and this means running the minimization process twice to see which polarity gives the best results. The amount of data to process for a given pin increases exponentially based on the number of input terms used; currently the program slows to a halt when processing a CPS-2 PAL that has 12 inputs (4096 equations). There are a number of optimizations that can be made, but for now I want to keep the program simple enough until the basic functions of it work properly. Then I'll tune it for speed. The dumping process has been tweaked quite a bit and it can dump a PAL in a few seconds instead of ~15 minutes. Note that the dumping process (generating a binary dump of all PAL states from the target device itself) and the minimization (turning the state data into a set of equations) are two very different things. I have been running tests on the Jaleco Mega System 32 hardware, but for some reason I can't get any layer other than the text foreground layer to appear. I'm sure all I need is the right combination of video register settings and priority RAM settings, but nothing is working yet. Hopefully I'll have more updates about it in the near future.
-  2nd November  2007: Charles MacDonald - Replacing a PAL: I picked up an Irem Gunforce (M92) board recently. After dumping the PALs I found the board wouldn't boot and the picture wouldn't sync - turns out IC51 had been inserted backwards. Oops! What kind of damage had been done? Hopefully just IC51 was bad and the rest of the hardware was OK. IC51 is a 16L8 type PAL. The device was programmed in 'simple' mode as opposed to 'complex' mode which allows output pins to be tri-stated individually. Bidirectional pins 13 and 15 were always tri-stated, so they were inputs, or (less likely) outputs with their output enables turned off. Which inputs were used? Of the six outputs, each one only uses a handful of inputs. This seemed promising - there would be less data to examine. A number of the inputs were never used, either the settings particular to Gunforce didn't call for them or the pins were left disconnected. At some point I'll take the two PCB apart to see what these pins are connected to. What you don't always see is a case where each output pin has only one set of inputs that drive that pin to a certain level. That meant all other sets of input combinations could be rejected (omitted in the above listing for brevity). This also revealed the "active" polarity for each output pin, active low, low, low, low, high, low respectively. I had some 22V10 to 16V8 adapters from my CPS-2 projects, so I wrote up a set of replacement equations in WinCUPL. I burned the resulting JEDEC fusemap to a 22V10, plugged the adapter into the IC51 socket on the Gunforce board and powered it up. Success! The self-checks passed and the attract mode started cycling. As the first real use of dumping an unknown PAL and (manually) generating a replacement, the PAL analyzer worked perfectly. Not all PALs use simple logic equations as shown above and that's where you need the software to examine and reject unused input settings automatically. You could easily have thousands of input settings to look through. But in this case, the data set was small enough to be examined by hand. The old PAL seems to be permanently damaged, when redumped the data suggests all bidirectional pins have changed to input only. So remember, don't plug PALs in backwards! Or at least dump them first.
- 26th October   2007: Charles MacDonald - PAL analyzer: A few months ago I developed a device to analyze read-protected PALs conforming to the 16x8 pinout over a USB connection. The hardware works fine, but the software has been quite difficult to write given all the different ways PALs can be configured. I think I'll release the project files soon rather than wait any longer to finish it. Currently the software can detect the following: - Bidirectional pin function (input, output, output+OE). - Inputs used by a bidirectional pin in output or output+OE mode. - Inputs used for the OE-enabling input of a bidirectional pin. - Device configuration (registered, complex, simple). - Presence of I9 acting as a global-OE for bidirectional pins. This is a hint towards identifying registered 16V8 PALs. Device support: All 16L4, 16L6, 16L8 compatible parts and 16V8 compatible parts in complex or simple mode. There is no standard way to determine how a registered PAL works, but you can write your own test function to send data to the PAL and see how it responds. This allows support of 16R4/6/8 and 18VC8 devices on a case-by-case basis, and PLS153/CK2605 devices if pins 9,11 aren't configured as outputs. It may be possible to support registered devices that simply latch inputs and used the feedback from the macrocells to feed the logic array, but more complex things like counters, state machines, shift registers, FIFOs, and multiple latches are too specific to detect in a generic way. Pins configured in combinatorial mode for a registered PAL that don't rely on feedback from a registered macrocell can still be analyzed, however. The next step is to determine the logical relationship between the input terms that enable a particular output or assert it, though that part isn't quite done. I have a working program to do this with a simple PALs (assuming 10 inputs, and all bidirectional pins are output-only, with no output enable controls) but it needs to be rewritten to support all configurations properly. When that is done a PAL dump can be converted to a CUPL source file describing all the logic the PAL implements. From that point you could burn a 100% compatible replacement part for repair or in the context of emulation see exactly what the PAL does. I've wanted a plug-and-play solution for PAL dumping in a lot of previous projects, and it's great to almost have it now.
- 0.111u6            : Moved src\jedutil.c to src\tools\.
- 0.106u12           : Aaron Giles fixed bug in JED parsing code that would checksum fuses beyond the number explicitly specified. Some programs write extra fuse data beyond the end and this should not be part of the checksum. Also made the checksum parsing more flexible to handle JED files with extra 0 digits in the file checksum.
- 0.105u4            : Added src\jedutil.c and jedparse.c/h. Aaron Giles added a new tool jedutil, which will convert .JED files to binary form and back again. Added new ROM region REGION_PLDS, which is designed to hold binary dumps of PLD fusemaps (produced from .JED files by jedutil). Added logic to -romident to automatically parse .JED files to identify them against these binary dumps. Added PLD dumps to the Vindicators, Batman, Pit Fighter, ThunderJaws and Relief Pitcher drivers. More to come shortly. Converted PLDs for catnmous and lazarian to the new binary format.

- 14th July      2013: Charles MacDonald - Data East 146 chip: Thanks to The Dumping Union I was able to purchase a "Super Shanghai Dragon's Eye" PCB. The board was designed by Data East for Hot-B and is mostly identical to other Data East boards of the same time period. This board needed PAL dumps and had some emulation problems in MAME prompting further investigation into the 146 protection chip. I made a few modifications to the board for finer control of the 146 and have been developing and testing a lot of trojan programs to figure out how the chip works. I haven't gotten around to adding my findings to MAME and I won't have time to do so for a while, so I've decided to put up the relevant documentation. It's mostly complete and should be able to augment the existing 146 emulation to help Super Shanghai and other games. I'd really like to do more work with the other Data East protection chips because they seem very similar to the 146. If anyone can help out with providing any of the 68000-based games that use these chips (such as Robocop 2, Rohga, etc.) maybe we can complete the emulation for them as well. I've finished a new PAL dumper design. Many ideas from the previous 68000-based prototype have been refined and implemented in the new one, which had design goals of lowering cost and simplifying assembly. Adding a proper ZIF socket and a software controlled power supply makes it easy to swap out chips when dumping, and allowed me to dump a box of 60 PALs in about an hour. The control software has more exhaustive tests to identify and confirm registered devices so you can easily tell how GAL chips are programmed and how they should be dumped. This version supports 20 and 24-pin combinatorial devices and dumping of 20-pin registered devices. I've finished the new combinatorial dump analyzer, and am working on adding more devices to the registered dumping software. Then I can start work on the analysis program to convert registered dumps back into human-readable logic which should be quite a challenge. Even if that proves too troublesome, we still have a way to preserve all the data in registered PALs now, and the analysis software can follow at a later time.

- 23rd August    2011: Charles MacDonald - Fake 22V10s: I recently bought a set of used Lattice GAL22V10D devices from China-based distributor that turned out to be counterfeit. They all have identical top-side labeling, including the speed grade and date code. The molded plastic body differs from chip to chip; some have an indendation for a pin 1 indicator, others have a notch, some have both. The ejector pin marks are frequently missing, and the body color is inconsistent and ranges from dark black to gray. All have a beveled edge around the top instead of a sharp edge like the real chips, likely due to sanding to remove the old markings. The pins were clean and bent out -- clearly not pulls as advertised. Out of the set of 50 there were two good chips, which physically matched regular 22V10s and were pulls with pencil markings indicating their original board position ("U10" and "U11"). I guess throwing in a few good PALs in the tube makes the transaction more legit. Now that Lattice discontinued the 16V8 and 22V10, these chips are rising in price and the pirates seem to have positioned themselves to benefit as people scramble to purchase the last batches available. I wonder what these chips really are, probably just junk that fits the 24-pin DIP form factor.
-  7th November  2010: Charles MacDonald - I've updated the PLA disassembler to fix a bug that was causing it to crash; as it turns out some device programmers do not specify a pin count in the JED file. Now the pin count is inferred from the fuse count. Thanks to the Dumping Union, we found it is possible to dump CK2605 PLAs as PLS153s, which results in an overdump as the PLS153 has more array rows than the CK2605 does. So I added an option to trim these rows and convert a PLS153 fusemap back to a CK2605 fusemap.
- 17th August    2010: Charles MacDonald - I've finished a tool for disassembling CK2605, PLS153, and PLS173 fusemaps. You can assign signal names from schematics or ones you come up with yourself to make the source equations more readable. As documentation is always important I would encourage users to name the signals and add comments where possible. You can also recompile the source code to target other devices, for example fitting a CK2605 or PLS153 design into a GAL16V8, or a PLS173 design into a GAL22V10D. This allows these older parts to be replaced with inexpensive modern equivalents. Of course these PLA devices have a different internal architecture from PALs, so not every design can fit. A PLA has a global pool of AND gates that any OR gate can include, whereas a PAL has a fixed set of AND gates per OR gate. It's possible for a PLA to specify many AND gates for any one input, and for multiple OR gates to share multiple AND gates from the pool. Here's an example of how the tool works. Shinobi uses a Signetics CK2605 PLA for part 315-5214 which implements glue logic for the Z80. Invoking the tool like so will disassemble the fusemap using the assigned pin names and produce a CUPL file that can be used with WinCUPL. On a GAL16V8 these pins are fixed inputs and do not have characteristics that need to be defined. WinCUPL will generate a fusemap that you can use to program a GAL16V8 and use to directly replace the chip on a Shinobi PCB. Later I will add an option for more compact output that folds the AND and OR gate definitions together. Keeping them split makes it clear which resources each pin uses, but it does decrease readability. And I plan to merge the 22V10 disassembler and this tool together too.
- 19th July      2010: Charles MacDonald - I've been working on the prototype PAL reader and finally hit a development milestone, I was able to dump two PAL16R4s through an automated process. Unlike dumping combinatorial PALs, registered PALs have no straightforward reading procedure. This is where the onboard processing power of the 20 MHz 68000 and the large amount of work RAM came in handy. The program starts by resetting the device and mapping other states that are connected to the reset state. While it does this, it builds up a list of state transition values so that it can search states that are more deeply linked. All the states and all their transitions are explored recursively, and in the end the state machine has been fully exercised and all possible outputs are recorded. The processing involved is moderately complex and requires efficient access to large data structures and multi-dimesional arrays in RAM, which the 68000 addressing modes are well suited for. In fact, a 68020 would do a better job but sadly it appears Freescale no longer makes them. As much as I'd like to put a 68060 in this thing it has to stay inexpensive. The next step is to generalize the algorithm so that 16R6 and 16R8 PALs can be read, and then support 16V8s. At that point I think all registered PALs within those device families could then be dumped and preserved. It will be possible to support registered 22V10 designs in some configurations, but any device that can be programmed to hide its internal state has the potential to be undumpable, such as the 18CV8 which has buried registers. The final step is to develop analysis software that can examine a registered PAL dump and turn it back into logic equations for recompilation and/or retargeting. Already it's clear that this step will produce results that will be functionally equivalent but certainly not representationally equivalent, and determining what the original registered structure was (FIFO, latch, counter, etc.) will likely be impossible. It will be up to the user to make a judgment call about the original implementation. This is more of a documentation issue than anything else. It's great to finally be at this point because reading registered PALs was one of the two 'big' PAL problems that I've been working on for about 3 years now, the other being feedback analysis. Getting this to work also validated some of the design decisions that went into the prototype PAL dumper, now I know which features to keep and which to drop for the next version. In other news I have finished a CK2605/PLS153 disassembler and am working on a CK2605 to PLS153 fusemap conversion tool. I'll try to get those released shortly.
- 14th February  2010: Charles MacDonald - Over the winter I had been working on the next revision of the PAL reader and decided to implement a number of experimental ideas to see what could be gained from them. The result is a 68000-based computer system. The hardware consists of the following: Freescale 68EC000 CPU @ 20 MHz, 1MB work RAM (can be used as ROM overlay), 512K Flash (boot loader), 128K page-mode EEPROM (non-volatile storage), Support for dumping 20 and 24-pin DIP PALs, Support for dumping 20 and 28-pin PLCC PALs, Lattice ISP programming interface (for ispGAL22V10C), High speed USB interface and Expansion port. The software for dumping 20/24-pin DIP PALs and 28-pin PLCC PALs works, and some of the basic ISP functions for entering ISP mode and reading the device ID also work. The bootloader allows software to be uploaded to RAM and has functions for memory upload/download, remote soft-reset, and diagnostics. I used a 68EC000 as it has an 8-bit data bus mode which simplified the process of manual routing for such a large 2-layer board. Several 22V10s were used to implement an address decoder, clock generator, programmable wait state generator (not unlike the one used in the System 16B boards), and I/O strobes for the PAL interface hardware. Needless to say with such a fast CPU and available RAM this system is very convenient to program for. Currently I'm working on an update to jed2cupl which will generate EPROM-type dumps from JED files. It will allow for virtual programming and dumping of a device based on CUPL code without having to program any real chips. This will be used to identify more edge cases for PAL analysis and to further validate the output of WinCUPL and the PAL dump analysis tool. I've also cleaned up and generalized the source quite a bit in anticipation of future 16V8 device support.
- 16th February  2009: Charles MacDonald - If you do not want to build the PAL reader, there is a very low-cost alternative for dumping combinatorial (not registered) PALs. You can construct an adapter that connects a 20-pin PAL to a 32-pin socket. By reading the PAL in a device programmer as a 27C020 EPROM you will get a 256K dump which the PAL analysis software can interpret. Please note that while this has worked in some cases, because it relies on the operation of your device programmer the results cannot be guaranteed to be accurate. One person told me about several good dumps that were made with the adapter and just a few PALs gave weird results. When all the PALs were later redumped on the dedicated PAL reading hardware the correct dumps were still correct and the bad dumps were now read properly. Keep in mind that it is just a hack.
- 15th January   2009: Charles MacDonald - The third revision of the PAL reader has had an update to fix a problem where USB enumeration wouldn't always work. Check out the online instructions for a step-by-step guide of how to modify the PCB and new PIC firmware. Current projects under development include: * Communications board for the PC-Engine using the new DLP-245R USB module. * USB-based RCA Studio 2 cartridge reader. * PAL programmer that interfaces directly with the PAL dumper. The latter should help testing different configurations as the chip can be programmed then dumped in one step and without removing and inserting chips over and over.
- 21st August    2008: Charles MacDonald - This week I finished assembling and testing the third version of the PAL reader hardware. Both 20-pin (16L8) and 24-pin (22L10) devices can be dumped, though the analysis software needs some considerable changes to support 24-pin chips. I'm moving towards a more device-independent way of analysis that could support other programmable logic devices of varying input and output pin counts, though I don't have plans at the present to make a PAL reader capable of doing that. The power switch (ST890C) works very nicely, it has an output that is asserted when there is a short circuit or an overheating condition and will cycle its power output when it cools down sufficiently to continue. This caught a short circuit on the PCB as I noticed the "fault" LED was always lit. I tested a few registered PALs and the power-up reset works as expected, the only quirk was that the clock input needs to be low for the reset to happen. If it's held high, not all of the macrocells are reset to '1'. This will allow all possible transitions from the reset state to the next state to be mapped, which the previous versions of the PAL reader couldn't do without manually cycling the power. Not something you'd want to do 256 times. What didn't work was the DS1233 reset generator, which should keep the /RESET output low for short while after the ST890C power output has reached a valid level. Instead, it directly follows the power output state, low when off and high when on. Without that necessary delay I can't accurately determine when the 'settling' time for the PAL has elapsed, at which point its power-on reset sequence is complete. A workaround was to insert a short delay on the PC side, but I would much rather find a better solution. There is an expansion connector intended for a PIC12F675 with all the power and related control signals available, so it should be possible to find a more suitable part or circuit and connect it there, or just use a PIC to monitor the output. And if the software was informed about the kind of PAL being dumped, it could poll the PAL outputs until they were reset though that would increase the time it took to process a registered PAL. Overall I am quite pleased with the results. The design is becoming more refined and the capabilities are increasing. Once it's ready for a release I will update the PAL reader package with the new files, PCB layout, and software.
-  6th August    2008: Charles MacDonald - I had received reports of PALs that couldn't be replaced because they used more input terms than a PAL supports. While the results were functionally correct and would compile for a virtual device, the results wouldn't fit in a replacement GAL16V8. A shortcoming in the analysis process was revealed where feedback wasn't properly taken into consideration. PALs have feedback taken from the point between the output buffer and bonding pad, which can be used as an input term by other outputs. Because the feedback is tapped at this particular point, it can be driven by the PALs output, or when the pin is tristated it can be driven by an external circuit. This allows for bidirectionality instead of forcing a pin to be input or output only. I had assumed WinCUPL would be able to minimize equations by taking the feedback of other outputs into account. But it doesn't, and for good reason: this is an unsafe optimization. If the pin in question was ever tristated then the feedback wouldn't represent the result of the logic associated of it, instead it would assume whatever state external circuitry on the pin set it to. Another less likely situation is that the output buffer of the PAL could be overridden if it was strongly driven high or low, say during a bus conflict, which would again make the feedback incorrect. From a design standpoint this isn't really an issue as the designer would always know if they wanted to use feedback or not. In retrospect it's probably pointless for the design software to try to work feedback into the optimization process because it would be explicitly specified. In terms of reverse engineering, this adds extra complexity to the analysis involved. I have started updating the software to take this into account, and it will likely take a while to work out all the associated issues. On the flip side it's nice to know that out of the many PALs people have dumped this was the only significant issue and that the results weren't really even incorrect, just not optimal. Special thanks to Nicola Salmoria for making sense out of the equations, and Chris Hardy and Corrado Tomaselli for providing PAL dumps, tracing PCB connections, and sharing information.
- 27th July      2008: Charles MacDonald - I have been working with Chris Hardy to determine how the Bagman security chip works. It is a PAL16R6 clocked independently of the CPU at about 30 Hz. A new 6-bit random number is generated each time and can be read by the Z80 as needed. It generate 55 unique values before the sequence repeats. There are many different ways the internal storage (state data) of a PAL can be linked together to form elements like shift registers, latches and counters. Rather than try to determine these very specific configurations, it's easier to look at the PAL from a generic point of view. The Bagman PAL has 6 registered macrocells and 8 inputs, so that's 64 possible states and 256 possible input configurations per state. This can be represented by a 'transition table', which says which state will be selected when the device is clocked, based on the current state and input settings. A problem arises as you fill out the table by feeding data to the PAL and recording the results: eventually you may reach a point where a very specific sequence of states has to be stepped through in order to reach the 'target' state you are mapping the inputs for. The rate at which the table is filled drops dramatically when this happens. To get around this I added code that checked if the current state was completely mapped out, and if so, it would find the path of state transitions that was necessary to reach the target state that needed further mapping. If no such path exists from the current state, a different state is selected and the path check is made again. This allowed all the input lists to get completely filled out for every state that was available. When analyzing the inputs, it was surprising to see that none of them were used by the registered logic. The address bus is available to the PAL, but does not affect random number generator. The bit from the timing circuit also wasn't used, and functioned independantly as an inverter. This greatly simplifies how the PAL functions as none of the inputs need to be taken into consideration when examining state changes. It's also highly unusual in terms of your typical registered PAL implementation. The next step was to create a replacement. Some of the initial designs we tested for a 16V8 didn't work, so I moved to a 22V10 (the only GAL I can program), dumping it through the PAL reader using a 22V10 to 16V8 adapter I made for the earlier CPS-2 project. As it turns out there is a strange quirk in WinCUPL; the state machine description which I generated from the transition table would compile, but only the optimized results (represented as logic equations) would generate a valid JED file for the 16V8. This was easy to fix, just cut and paste the results from the simulator output back into the CUPL source. But it is unfortunate this happens at all. Eventually we had a working GAL16V8 replacement for the Bagman PAL that produced identical output as the original part. Problem solved!
-  9th July      2008: Charles MacDonald - I've been working on the PCB layout for the third revision of the PAL reader. This new version will support 24-pin devices like the 20L8 and 20L10. It has a software controlled power switch so that registered devices can be initialized to a known state in a consistent manner by causing a power-on reset. If this works as expected, it should allow registered devices such as the PAL16R8 to be dumped. If it doesn't, the extra circutry can be bypassed with a jumper and it will function normally. I have also tried to address usability issues; there are mounting holes for standoffs, all parts except a SOIC-8 chip are socketed for easy repair, and there is more clearance around the PAL socket. There is still a lot to do as the new design has to be tested to confirm its operation, and the dumping and analysis software will need some considerable rework for the larger devices. But this is another step towards a better solution for dumping PALs.
- 11th May       2008: Guru - I received a small custom adapter from Charles MacDonald. It's used to raw-read PALs, especially protected ones. Very nice little gizmo that will hopefully be useful for solving some memory map related issues in MAME. I've already used it to dump the PALs from Captain Commando (CPS1).
- 0.105u4            : Added src\jedutil.c and jedparse.c/h. Aaron Giles added a new tool jedutil, which will convert .JED files to binary form and back again. Added new ROM region REGION_PLDS, which is designed to hold binary dumps of PLD fusemaps (produced from .JED files by jedutil). Added logic to -romident to automatically parse .JED files to identify them against these binary dumps. Added PLD dumps to the Vindicators, Batman, Pit Fighter, ThunderJaws and Relief Pitcher drivers. More to come shortly. Converted PLDs for catnmous and lazarian to the new binary format.
-  2nd May 2006: Aaron Giles - One of the best uses of MAME is the identification of random video game parts. Thanks to the -romident feature, you can dump a ROM or PROM from a game and pretty quickly identify what game you have. Believe me, as someone who owns a giant pile of PCBs, it is not always easy to tell. In theory, MAME should catalog all the programmable parts on an arcade PCB. This is useful not only because of the -romident feature, but also because if a part fails due to bit rot or corrosion or some other kind of damage (or is just missing), you can identify it, track down the data, and program yourself a new one. Up until now, we have only been really cataloging ROM-based devices, in spite of the fact that another class of device " the Programmable Logic Device (PLD) " is often found on PCBs, especially those dating from the mid-80's onward. PLDs are a class of device that includes PALs, GALs, and other related devices, which are programmable in much the same way that ROMs and EPROMs are. One of the big reasons why we haven't been including PLDs is because they are generally not stored in raw binary format, like ROM data. Rather, they are stored in a format known as the JEDEC file format (.JED), which is basically a text file containing all the data, with lots of room for programmer-inserted comments and many optional fields. This is not really a big problem in and of itself, except for the fact that every single programmer out there, when reading a PLD, will produce slightly different output. This in turn makes tools such as the -romident feature useless for such devices because -romident works by comparing the CRCs and SHA1s of the files, which would be different even for the same PLD read by different programmers. I finally took a close look at the .JED file format over the past week, and came up with several strategies for how MAME can finally begin cataloging these parts. After a bit of discussion, I finally settled on one that will be implemented in the 0.105u4 release which should be coming up shortly. Here is how it works. At the creamy center of a .JED file is what is known as the 'fuse map'. This is the raw set of binary 1s and 0s that get programmed into the PLD. In fact, the rest of the .JED file beyond that is mostly filler: some checksums, default states for unspecified fuses, etc. The final fuse map is really the important data, along with the type of device that was used (was it a GAL16V8A or a PAL16L8?). So the basic premise for logic devices in MAME works like this: the fuse map is stored in raw binary form, preceded by a single 32-bit (big-endian) value that specifies the total number of fuses. Each bit of the fuse map is packed into a byte from LSB to MSB. This, it turns out, is the exact format that is used for the internal fuse map checksum, so it is a natural arrangement. I decided not to try and encode the device type into the file because (a) there are way too many devices to be concerned with, and (b) many devices with similar but not identical names are equivalent. Rather, PLDs that are added to MAME should specify the device type in the filename. (Also keep in mind that if the device type were encoded into the file itself, then if person A reads a GAL16V8 and person B reads a GAL16V8A that contain identical data, they would not match). How do you get data in and out of this format? Well, starting with 0.105u4, the default build of MAME will build a new utility called jedutil, which can convert a .JED file into its binary form, and vice-versa. This means that you can find the binary form of a PLD, run jedutil on it, and extract a .JED which can be programmed into a real life PLD using any standard programmer. So how does this help -romident? Well, if you read a PLD from a board and want to see if it matches anything we've cataloged, you can do one of two things. You can take the resulting .JED and run jedutil on it to convert it to binary form. Or, you can just point -romident to the .JED file directly, because I've added code to the romident feature that recognizes .JED files and automatically parses them into binary form on the fly. The first experiments in using this will be the mid-80's and later Atari games, which I've been working on cleaning up the names on, and which I've already read the GALs from. I know there are several other games out there that we already have good PAL/GAL dumps from as well. Hopefully we can produce an even more complete catalog of arcade game devices as a result. Many of Atari's games used GALs to control the logic for memory addressing, video and sound. Unfortunately, most of the GALs on shipping Atari boards have the security fuse blown, meaning that if one goes bad, you'll have a tough time trying to make a replacement. Furthermore, since GALs are EEPROM based, they are subject to deterioration over time. Luckily, some equipment does exist that can read these protected GALs. So, as a service to anyone out there who needs a replacement GAL to fix an Atari board, I've decided to set up this page where you can grab the necessary JEDEC files for any GALs you need to replace. Disclaimer: Although these reads were taken from working boards, I have not programmed replacements for these to verify that the JEDEC files are accurate.

P20.2   GAL (Gate Array Logic)

- 14th November  2014: Charles MacDonald - Over the summer I developed on a device programmer for Lattice GALs. The GAL16V8 and GAL22V10 are currently supported, and Porchy sent a bunch of other GAL types to be added as well. I used PJRC's Teensy 3.1 microcontroller board which is unique in having both an DAC and ADC as well as a decent amount of on-chip Flash and work RAM. This makes it well suited for more complex applications, and it was a good fit for this circuit which has an analog section for generating a digitally adjustable programming voltage ranging all the way from 1.25V to 19.25V. The utility program has the usual functions to erase, program and verify a GAL, and also has functions to auto-detect the programming interface (different for each chip type), determine if a device is read-protected, and an assortment of other diagnostic options. What's really been interesting is to fill in the missing details between what was experimentally determined in existing GAL programmers, and the information in Lattice's patents. I've written extensive documentation on this subject and once the remaining devices are supported, I'll publish that data here. Eventually this project will be open-sourced and I'll make the schematics and circuit board layout available too. Between this and the PAL reader there is now a complete solution for reading, programming and testing PALs and GAL devices.

It provides a similar type of security, but is programmed onto a GAL6001, rather than a custom part. It was created because Atari was running out of slapstics to use in their games, and the original masks for the slapstic had been lost by the company that manufactured them. A separate FAQ for this chip is planned for the future.

- 0.155              : Registering save state in INS8250 [Wilbert Pol]. NS8250 fixes. Loopback: tx goes high and data is clocked at the correct rate instead of appearing instantly. Modem status register: Don't lose track of external signals when starting, resetting, switching loopback off, writing to register. Handshaking: Active low for consistency (RS232 port now defaults handshaking lines high and serial mouse dtr/rts handling has been adjusted). Call interrupt callback after clearing internal interrupt state when resetting. 8250 write protect 0x40 in line status register, this bit is used to track whether diserial is running and will call us back. mpz80 writes 0 to this bit and waits for it to be set again, it used to work because loopback was HLE'd. The 8250 datasheet says that transmission in loopback goes through the shift registers, the way the old code worked wouldn't test any send/receive functionality of the chip at all. It's unknown whether clearing this bit would cause the chip to start shifting, the datasheet says you shouldn't write to the register at all & it's reserved for testing the chip in the factory. Initialize m_regs.ier register to stop interrupts randomly being generated before reset, fixes Portfolio booting [smf].

Follow Aaron's official DEVCB2 pattern. Implement OP3 toggle on timer expire and input delta interrupts. We're going to start phasing out the old pull method of reading the input ports in order to facilitate the input delta handling. Make loopback operate at the current baud rate instead of instantaneously. Fixes (MESS) 'DECtalk DTC-01' DUART self-test [R. Belmont]. Changed parity & stop bits to an enum (you can now pass in 1.5). I've updated the uarts that were testing for 1.5 stop bits to pass that in, but there are probably others & 1.5 stop bits is converted to 2 by diserial. However the 68681 requires stop bits to be specified in clocks, so this will change in the future. Replaced synchronous flag with start bit count, as some uarts can use a start bit in synchronous mode & that whether there is a start bit is all the flag is currently controlling. Updated rs232 terminal to allow startbits, stop bits 1.5 to be specified (although that is currently not supported by diserial) and individual transmit and receive baud rates [smf]. Start removing usage of deprecated 68681 INPORT_CALLBACK. (MESS) Cat: Removed hacks required by the old 68681 implementation; keyboard works again. Fixed a few uninitalized variables, beefed up optional logging. Return bits 6 and 7 of the input port register correctly [R. Belmont]. Fixed the DUART ip pins so they don't accidentally clear each other's state on device_write_line; this fixes the Canon Cat printing in MESS. Only clear input state on start, not reset. Don't trust the start order [Lord Nightmare]. Removed old 68681 duart [Miodrag Milanovic].

- 0.148              : Added machine\n68681.c/h. Checkpoint of "n68681" modernized, diserial-ized 68681 device. This covers the modernization aspect; the diserial-ization comes next. Do not convert other drivers to use this yet. Preliminary working DUART N68681 diserial-based I/O. Fixed compile on MacOSX 10.6.8 (machine\n68681.c) [R. Belmont].

- 0.146              : DUART fix for counter mode making SC4 not assert (machine\68681.c) [Miodrag Milanovic]. 68681 DUART timers start immediately; unlike counters they don't wait for a start command. Fixed MC68681 generation of spurious interrupts, and provide ASSERT/CLEAR states to the IRQ callback [R. Belmont].

I6.12  6821

- 0.188              : 6821 PIA logging improvements: Use logmacro.h interface. Removed device tags superfluous with modern logerror. Make LOG_SETUP actually handle something [AJR].
- 0.184              : Incremental C++-ification of 6821pia.cpp.1: Changed some 'int' ==> 'bool' where appropriate. 2. Changed the various control byte macros to static functions [Nathan Woods].

Removed 6821 porta_r/portb_r/ca1_r/ca2_r/cb1_r/cb2_r functions as they only returned what you'd written to the chip, only a couple of those were ever used (by audio\exidy.c). Removed some ca*/cb* read callbacks that just returned what had already been pushed or always returned 0. As there are no longer any cb2 read callbacks that functionality has been removed. Reduced the number of callers to set_a_input by calling porta_w & made the WRITE8_HANDLER call that as well, instead of the other way round and having to lookup an address space that is never used (audio\exidy.c, spiders.c and drivers\toratora.c). Removed 6821 from the MCFG PIA macros, not all PIA's are 6821's. Fixed slither/slithera 6821 PIA hookup [smf].

- 0.124u3            : Aaron Giles removed word-sized handlers from 6821pia.c. Updated drivers that needed them to use these new interfaces instead.
- 0.122u6            : 6821 PIA changes [Zsolt Vasvari]: Added orthogonal accessors. Removed hacky update_shared_irq_handler(), now the same IRQ callback maybe called multiple times, but this shouldn't be a problem. IRQ lines are cleared on a reset.
- 0.120              : Tim Lindner changed 6821 PIA logging so that it only logs core messages once.
- 0.115u3            : Zsolt Vasvari updated PIA interfaces to support masks for port A/B inputs. This allows proper behavior of unconnected pins, according to the specs. Updated a number of games to use the new interfaces. Fixed subtle behavior in handling of PIA port A. This allows for the removal of hacks in the Qix driver and the Williams driver. Fixed PIA numbers in revamped Spiders driver.
- 0.115u2            : Zsolt Vasvari removed the addressing order parameter from pia_config() and replaced it with dedicated write and read handlers.

- 0.132u5            : Added machine\i8255a.c/h. Intel 8255A PPI (MESS Team): Added a new implementation of the I8255A device. Rewritten from scratch to properly support handshaking in modes 1 and 2. Refactored sg1000a.c to use the new implementation.
- 0.132u1            : Curt Coder fixed handshaking signals for PPI8255 modes 1/2, and mode 2 input mask.
- 0.129u3            : Aaron Giles converted the 8255PPI device to use the structure of new module DEVCB, and updated all users to use the DEVCB macros, removing some unnecessary trampoline functions along the way.

- 0.127u6            : 8255 PPI interface cleanup [Aaron Giles]: Added MDRV_PPI8255_ADD, MDRV_PPI8255_RECONFIG and MDRV_PPI8255_REMOVE macros; updated all drivers to use them. Changed callbacks to device read/write handlers intead of machine read/write handlers; updated all drivers accordingly. Normalized function and variable names to be lower_under. Removed a number of redundant interfaces from the galaxian/scramble line of games.
- 0.124u4            : Wilbert Pol converted the PPI8255 implementation to a device.

- NOTES: The 8255 is a programmable peripheral interface. It has three 8-bit I/O ports. 24 I/O ports are divided into two groups (Port A and B) which are programmable independently by control words provided by MPU. The PPI has three operation modes (Mode 0, 1 and 2) and is capable of versatile interface between MPU and peripheral devices. Zaxxon's discrete circuits is triggered by an output pin of the 8255. There are four registers in the 8255. They are mapped to (111x xxxx 0011 11pp) by Zaxxon. Zaxxon writes to these at FF3C-FF3F. There are three modes of the 8255, but by the schematics I can see that Zaxxon is using "Mode 0", which is very simple.

I6.3   VIA (Versatile Interface Adapter)

I6.31  6522

- 0.186              : Refactored shifter supporting more fetures and fixed a few bugs. Removed old code and cleaned up a bit. Tuned shifter IRQ timing to be more cycle accurate. Fixed the flank timer value which improved but not completelly reverted the Vectrex regression [Joakim Larsson Edstrom].
- 0.183              : Updated LOG messages to latest cut and added some new. Fixed 50/50 duty cycle for T2 and O2 driven CB1 shift IN & OUT on CB2. Added stop of device_timer when going from internaly to externaly clocked shift modes. Fixed so shift out and in flank is not controlled by pcr in accordance with datasheet. Added missing final and leading flanks when shifting out and in respectivelly [Joakim Larsson Edstrom].
- 0.161              : Added 6522 VIA device address map [Curt Coder].
- 0.158              : Added missing save states to 6522 VIA, fixes at least Konkyuu no Hoshi save state problem [Osso].
- 0.154              : Fixed usage of uninitialized members in via6522_device [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.153              : Convert VIA6522 to use DEVCB2. Converted pa* & pb* inputs to WRITE_LINE_MEMBER. Removed read_ca*/read_cb* in Beezer as they just returned what you'd written to the chip already. Removed readpb & readcb2 callbacks from (MESS) Commodore LCD VIA6522 configuration. Changed write_cb2 to work with shift register. Removed VIA6522 ca2 callback as the value is already pushed in aristmk4.c and beezer.c. Removed ca1/ca2/cb1 callbacks as they were never called anyway. Removed cb2 callback from (MESS) MAC drivers, you now have to push the data. Fix for potential loss of state change. Removed the simplest 6522 port callbacks in gameplan.c and trvquest.c. Added support for shift out free running at t2 rate, cb1 output now lasts for the specified number of clocks and the signal goes low at the end. 6522 CA1 is input only, so I have removed the output callback. The (MESS) Lisa via hookup has been changed as it had functions named as CA2/CB2 hooked up to CA1/CB1 and CA1 output no longer exists, it appears to have been wrong since before the code was merged with MAME. Changed CB1 to be active low as CA2 & CB2 already are & it sort of was before, but when the chip is reset then the handlers are called setting the lines to 1. This seems to stop it thinking that you've pressed a key at startup as I believe it got out of sync before because the lines weren't consistent. Merged some duplicate code for handling outputs and removed some obvious comments. Serial data is shifted in just before cb1 goes high, not just after it goes low. Allow reading from port A in output mode. Add a separate bit for timer 1 PB7 toggling rather than changing the PB register directly. Don't clear the SR register on reset. Clears pcr & acr at construct time, in case something sets one of the handshaking lines before we've started. Use a separate variable for the latched inputs and the current inputs. Consolidated the input and output code. Clears port a and port b latches at startup, temporarily reverted CA1 timing change as Beezer is extremely sensitive to CB2 timing, temporarily prevented port a read handlers from affecting reading back of output bits (real hardware can do this but some handlers are returning 0 for bits that they aren't driving low). Simplified VIA 6522 irq handling [smf].
- 0.148u2            : Fixed uninitialized members in machine\6522via.c [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.148              : Used core clock/attotime functions in 6522 VIA [Curt Coder].

- 0.97u2             : Mathis Rosenhauer fixed the way the VIA 6522 shift register was implemented to get rid of the previous hacky way.
- 0.78u5             : Nicola Salmoria rewroted machine\6522via.c. This fixed the gfx problems and bad sound in the Gameplan driver, video\gameplan.c is no longer needed. Fixed port writes in machine\6522via so that pins set as input are pulled high. This is required by the gameplan games and is confirmed by the 65422 data sheet. Added support for CA2 pulse handshake.
- 0.77u1             : 6522 VIA fixes and updates from MESS [Nathan Woods].

I6.5   CIA (Complex Interface Adapter)

I6.51  MOS6526

- 0.189              : Show state of registers that can be read without side effects in debugger [plgDavid].
- 0.186              : Changed name 'MOS6526' to 'MOS 6526 CIA'.
- 0.163              : Fixed MOS6526 port A/B read [geecab].
- 0.154              : Removed machine\6526cia.c/h. Fixed usage of uninitialized members in mos6526_device and legacy_mos6526_device [Oliver Stöneberg]. Fixed macros in machine\6526cia.h and mos6526.h [Curt Coder]. Kill the legacy CIA emulation. CIA changes: Added missing virtual keyword to actually call the right TOD clock. Outputs depend on the input state (fixes A1000 overlay switch). Switching to serial output mode with one-shot activated causes a pulse on SP (correct? needed for keyboard handshake). Serial input is clocked by the CNT input, not the default clock. Mask offsets to 4 bits. Writing the Timer High register with one-shot activated immediately causes the timer to be latched and the timer started, regardless of timer start value [Dirk Best].
- 0.153              : MOS6526 DEVCB2 cleanup and WIP. Converted 6526 CIA temporarily to DEVCB2 until MOS6526 works with Amiga. Cleaned up CIA access a bit (machine\amiga.c) [Curt Coder]. Fix for Amiga regression, machine\6526cia.c made infinite loop. Removed legacy not used code [Miodrag Milanovic].

- 0.147u1            : Added machine\mos6526.c/h. Added proper start value (initialize data direction registers) [Miodrag Milanovic]. Implemented a nearly cycle-exact "old" MOS6526 CIA, which passes most of the Lorenz/VICE CIA tests (drivers\alg.c, arcadia.c, cd32.c, mquake.c and upscope.c) [Curt Coder].
- 0.147              : Improved MOS6526 interface [Curt Coder].
- 0.145u5            : The PC output will now go low for 1 cycle following a read/write of port B (instead of being toggled immediately) (machine\6526cia.c) [Curt Coder].
- 0.136u2            : Curt Coder refactored the CIA 6526 interface, adding SP/CNT callbacks. Fixed serial transfer. Harmony updated the 6526 CIA device to no longer be legacy.
- 0.135u4            : Curt Coder fixed CIA6526 FLAG handling and slight interface cleanup.
- 0.134              : Roberto Zandona fixed 6526 CIA PRA, PRB, DDRA and DDRB ports and added partial fix to 6526 CIA timer: Avoid timer's desync in read count operation.
- 0.133u5            : Roberto Zandona added different TOD implementation for CIA6526 and CIA8520.
- 0.129u5            : Dirk Best added support for the /PC output pin to the CIA emulation.
- 0.129u4            : Nathan Woods changed 6526cia to use DEVCB.
- 0.129u1            : Nathan Woods added a validity check to the 6526 CIA emulation.
- 0.128u5            : Made the 6526/8520 CIA implementations be devices [Nathan Woods]: Added differentiation between the r1 and r2 versions of the 6526; not acting on it yet.
- 0.125u1            : Roberto Zandona added feature to the cia6526: In READ operation the value can be forced by a external circuit; this feature is necessary for MESS.
- 0.117              : Peter Rittwage reverted patch to the 6526CIA as it was causing issues with Amiga/Arcadia emulation.
- 0.115u3            : Peter Rittwage fixed bit calculation in 6526cia.c which broke joysticks in the MESS C64 driver.
- 0.111u4            : Ernesto Corvi fixed system time counters in the Amiga code.
- 0.111u2            : Amiga core system updates [Ernesto Corvi]: Updated 6526/8520 CIA to be able to set the value of the SP pin. This is needed to emulate the Amiga keyboard. Fixed a bug on the 6526/8520 CIA that prevented chained counters from working.
- 0.111u1            : Ernesto Corvi reimplemented one-shot timer modes in the 6526 CIA (Amiga) emulation.

I6.6   ACIA (Asynchronous Communications Interface Adapter)

I6.61  6551

- 0.157              : Fixed receive with parity != none in MOS6551 [Sandro Ronco].
- 0.154              : Support 115200 bit/s on Apple III (machine\mos6551.c). Stop the internal timer if DTR is high and there is no character being received as neither the transmit or receive will do anything anyway. The default is for the internal divider to be disabled so if the chip wasn't initialised then the timer would be running at the full rate of the xtal. Fixed uninitialised variable that could prevent transmit irq from being generated after reset. Ignore reads from the debugger [smf]. Fixed usage of uninitialized members in mos6551_devicee [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.153              : Call set_data_frame() before stc_rcv_rate() in MOS6551, as since r26274 there is random behaviour if you don't. Rewritten 6551 emulation. Changed clock to be the o2 clock instead of the baud rate xtal, supports external clocking, generates transmit interrupts when idle, added echo mode, dcd/dsr/cts input handling, parity & stop bit checking. Tested and fixed hookup to (MESS) Commodore LCD & Plus 4 [smf]. Support Rockwell 6551s, which show different register contents from MOS/CSG parts on reset [R. Belmont].
- 0.152              : Removed unused rxd callback from MOS6551 and made DEVCB2 consistent with other implementations [smf].
- 0.149              : Added RS-232 ports to machine\mos6551.c [Curt Coder].
- 0.148u2            : Added MOS6551 serial callbacks. Fixed typo (machine\mos6551.h). (MESS) Connected the C64 Turbo232/SwiftLink cartridges' RS-232 port to the 6551 ACIA [Curt Coder].
- 0.148u1            : Changed machine\6551acia.c/h to machine\mos6551.c/h. DEVCB2 conversions (machine\mos6551.c/h). Refactored all drivers to use the new MOS6551 and removed the old implementation (MESS + drivers\cops.c) [Curt Coder].
- 0.146u5            : Disabled debug logging [Curt Coder].

I6.62  6850

- 0.176              : Make ACIA write initial line state in reset to avoid crash [Vas Crabb].
- 0.168              : Added 6850ACIA serial port (untested) to (MESS) Osborne-1, use configured banking [Vas Crabb].
- 0.159              : Fixed 6850 ACIA parity [Carl]. This fixed many sets in mpu4vid.c stops at a "Serial Link Failure" screen (MT#05498).
- 0.154              : Fixed usage of uninitialized members in acia6850_device [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.153              : Fixed uninitialised variables, (MESS) Atari ST mouse works again. Hooked ACIA 6850 up to (MESS) Altair 8800bt. Rewritten 6850 based on datasheet using external CLOCK & removed MIDI clock hacks. (MESS) GUS gf1_device device derives from acia6850_device to gain access to the tx & rx irq state, rather than exposing it with a public method. Fixed bug in sending that showed up using terminal. Tidied up enum names, fixed frame error detection [smf].
- 0.152              : Replaced read rx/cts/dcd callbacks in ACIA6850 write handlers, which allows multiple chips to be connected together without using glue methods. Changed write_rx to update the correct variable [smf].
- 0.148u4            : Wilbert Pol improved 6850ACIA DCD signal handling.
- 0.148u2            : Fixed uninitialized variables and members in machine\6850acia.c [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.148u1            : Added 6850ACIA accessor function for status [Barry Rodewald].
- 0.147u4            : Bring 6850ACIA IRQ line into standard usage (ASSERT_LINE = IRQ active) [R. Belmont]. (mame\drivers\bfcobra.c, mpu4vid.c and mess\drivers\mirage.c) are the only 3 drivers I found that appear to use the 6850 IRQ callback; many others had it commented out. If you own such a driver and you commented it out due to weird behavior or whatever (isa_gus.c?) you might want to try again.
- 0.140u3            : Curt Coder adjusted MC6850 receive/transmit timer periods when clocks are changed. Also added receive byte function to MC6850 ACIA for MESS generic terminal emulation.
- 0.139u2            : Harmony updated the ACIA 6850 device to no longer be legacy.
- 0.137u3            : Phil Bennett improved handling of 6850ACIA /CTS signal and fixed issue with transmission parity generation.
- 0.129u4            : Curt Coder refactored the ACIA6850 to use DEVCB. Only adjust the 6850acia rx/tx bit timers on a control write if the divide ratios have changed [Phil Bennett].
- 0.128u5            : Made the 6850 ACIA a device [Nathan Woods].
- 0.124u1            : James Wallace added dynamic control of RX and TX pins to 6850 ACIA emulation - this is needed for correct operation of the MPU4 Video communications system, and may be handy for some MESS systems. To use, set the rx and tx clocks to 0 in the acia interface, then use acia_tx_clock_in() and acia_rx_clock_in() respectively.
- 0.123u4            : Kingshriek improved (not perfect) ACIA slot monitoring.
- 0.123u3            : Some improvements to the 6850 ACIA CTS pin checking logic and the MPU4 ACIA clock logic [James Wallace].
- 0.123u2            : James Wallace changed the 6850 core to allow dynamic RX and TX clock alteration, to at least try to remove a few of the MPU4 timing problems.
- 0.120u2            : Rewrote ACIA6850 implementation [Curt Coder].
- 0.118u1            : Curt Coder changed 6850ACIA to use MSB/LSB read handlers.
- 0.114u2            : MPU4 improvements [James Wallace]: Decommissioned machine\mpu4.c, as the 6850acia code from Phil does the same job, making one less thing to maintain.
- 0.113              : Added machine\6850acia.c/h.
- 0.108u3            : Removed machine\6850acia.c/h. Big update to the MPU4 driver [El Condor]: Added support for reverse clocking in the VFD code. Changed the 6840 to not run the counter clock if no frequency is specified. Reworked the MPU4 drastically to be more in sync with AGEMAME. MPU4 video should now be working a little better. Deprecated machine\6850acia.c, replacing it with a specialized driver (machine\mpu4.c).
- 0.103u2            : Added machine\6850acia.c/h.

I6.7   RS232

- 0.176              : Added rtscts flow control for rs232\null_modem.cpp and relevant fix to i8251 [shattered]. Make flow control optional (rs232\null_modem.cpp) [Carl].
- 0.153              : Added bus\rs232\loopback.c/h. Changed mess\machine\serial.c/h to emu\bus\rs232\rs232.c/h. Moved mess\machine\null_modem.c/h to emu\bus\rs232\. Removed imagedev\serial.c/h. Changed parity & stop bits to an enum (you can now pass in 1.5). I've updated the uarts that were testing for 1.5 stop bits to pass that in, but there are probably others & 1.5 stop bits is converted to 2 by diserial. Replaced synchronous flag with start bit count, as some uarts can use a start bit in synchronous mode & that whether there is a start bit is all the flag is currently controlling. Updated rs232 terminal to allow startbits, stop bits 1.5 to be specified (although that is currently not supported by diserial) and individual transmit and receive baud rates. Separated RS232 devices. Added hack for required_device not being set until device_start(), it would be nice if they were filled in during config complete (null_modem.h). Hooked up dtr/rts/rxc to serial port & introduced the etc pin to rs232 (pin 24 Transmitter Signal Element Timing/External Transmitter Clock). Added RS232 loopback [smf].
- 0.152              : Converted serial & RS232 devices to DEVCB2 [smf].

- 0.146u4            : Added machine\tms9901.c/h. Moved TMS9901 from mess\machine into emu\machine subtree [Michael Zapf].
- NOTES: TMS9901 is a Programmable System Interface and a support chip for TMS9900. It handles interrupts, provides several I/O pins, and a timer (a.k.a. clock: it is merely a register which decrements regularly and can generate an interrupt when it reaches 0). It communicates with the TMS9900 with the CRU bus, and with the rest of the world with a number of parallel I/O pins. I/O and timer functions should work with any other 990/99xx/99xxx CPU. On the other hand, interrupt handling was primarily designed for TMS9900 and 99000 based systems: other CPUs can support interrupts, but not the 16 distinct interrupt vectors.

Converted (MESS) X68000 keyboard into a separate serial device. This allows the removal of the UART HLE in the driver (which didn't work, it was always two characters behind). diserial cannot sync with the start bit properly when using an external clock, so for now I've added a hack that is only enabled when using the MC68901 (setting the flag ignores the extra spurious bit that was getting shifted in). Removed MC68901 polling for gpio bits (mess\drivers\atarist.c and x68k.c). Stores all bits written to gpip register, so that it can update the output when changing the ddr register & renamed variables to tie up more with the description in the data sheet [smf]. Converted MC68901 device to DEVCB2 [Osso].
- 0.152              : Replaced read rx callback in MC68901 with a write handler, which allows multiple chips to be connected together without using glue methods. Removed a load of unused code from MC68901, probably left over when it was converted to use diserial [smf].

I8.31  Lamp Driver
- 0.118              : Removed machine\lamps.c/h.
- 0.103u2            : Added machine\lamps.c/h.
- NOTES: For the 'Lamp Driver' in Spy Hunter is a 3-to-8 latching demuxer connected to the input bits. Three of the inputs (J1-11,10,12) specify which output to write to, and the fourth input (J1-14) is the data value. A fifth input (J1-13) controls the strobe to latch the data value for the demuxer. The eight outputs directly control 8 lamps.
- SOURCE: machine\lamps.cpp

I8.32  Lamp Sequencer
- NOTES: For the 'Lamp Sequencer' in Discs of Tron is a 556 timer set up in astable mode with two different frequencies, one using R1=R2=10k and C=10uF giving a frequency of 4.8 Hz, and the second using R1=R2=5.1k and C=10uF giving a frequency of 9.4118 Hz. The outputs of these clocks go into a mux at U4, whose input is selected by the input bit latched from J1-6. The output of the mux clocks a 16-bit binary counter at U3. The output of the binary counter becomes the low 4 address bits of the 82S123 PROM at U2. The upper address bit comes from the input bit latched from J1-5. Each of the 5 output bits from the 82S123 is inverted and connected to one of the lamps. The /CE pin on the 82S123 is connected to the input bit latched from J1-4. Thus: J1-4 enables (0) or disables (1) the lamp sequencing, J1-5 selects one of two 16-entry sequences stored in the 82S123 and J1-6 selects one of two speeds (0=4.8 Hz, 1=9.4118 Hz).

I8.33  Flasher
- NOTES: For the 'Flasher Control' in Discs of Tron is a 555 timer set up in astable mode with R1=R2=56k and C=1uF giving a frequency of 8.5714 Hz. The timer is enabled if J1-3 is high (1). The output of the timer is connected to the input of a D-type flip flop at 1A, which is clocked by the AC sync (since this is a fluorescent light fixture). The J1-4 input is also connected the input of another D-type flip flop on the same chip at 1A. The output of this directly controls the light fixture. Thus: J1-3 enables a strobe effect at 8.5714 Hz (77.616ms high, 38.808ms low) and J1-4 directly enables/disables the lamp. The two outputs are wire-ored together.

I8.34  Stepper motor

- 0.157              : Converted steppers to device_t [Ramiro Polla]. Attempt at fixing the new Stepper device to load correctly for AWP games. This is part 1 of a plan to remove the stepper_interface for a devcb2 setup. Significant change to Stepper motor device behaviour, using devcb2 interfaces. New functions added: MCFG_STEPPER_ADD(tag) - add a stepper device, MCFG_STEPPER_REEL_TYPE(type) - the equivalent of the first line in the old interface, now also takes NOT_A_REEL for printer and similar applications, MCFG_STEPPER_START_INDEX(int index) - the old second line of the interface, the position (in half steps) where the optic tab first triggers, MCFG_STEPPER_END_INDEX(int index)  - the old third line of the interface, the last position (in half steps) where the optic tab triggers, MCFG_STEPPER_INDEX_PATTERN(int pattern) - a coil pattern in hexadecimal that has to be on the motor for the index to trigger (0 if no specific pattern is needed) and MCFG_STEPPER_INIT_PHASE(int phase) - starting phase of the motor. All drivers have been updated, testing done to all specific drivers - Scorpion 4 was particularly complex [James Wallace].
- 0.156              : Moved mame\machine\steppers.c/h emu\machine\. Added absolute position for stepper motor [Ramiro Polla].
- 0.146u1            : Improved reel motor and optical alignment for reels as related to the layout interface. Comment: Made a significant change to how stepper motors operate in MAME - it is now possible to align a reel motor properly in the interface (namely by specifying what motor phase is active at 0). As a consequence, reverse spin should only be specified in layouts, and optical alignment should be much better. As a note, Scorpion 4 has had its interface changed to one specifically for its reel type, it may be worth watching for regressions in their behaviour as a result. It looks like that particular reel type can move its opto tab around the circumference of the unit, so different interfaces may be needed [James Wallace].
- 0.145u7            : Did some stepper motor work to support more types [James Wallace].
- 0.142u1            : Added reverse-spin support to the stepper motor simulator [James Wallace].

Added standard layout for Starpoint units used in many machines. Updated all affected drivers [James Wallace].
- 0.122u7            : Scorpion 2 has also been altered to match the MPU4 coding style, where proper handlers re now included for the stepper motor data, which can then be expanded on in AGEMAME [James Wallace].
- 0.111u3            : Added save state support to the steppermotor emulation module (machine\steppers.c) [James Wallace].
- 0.103u2            : Added mame\machine\steppers.c/h.

I9.22  WD2010

- 0.188              : Improved WD2010 emulation. Better feedback on cylinder positions. Almost all checks of the winchester test pass (option 16 @ RX50DIAG.TD0 diskette), except low level tests expecting manufacturer or diagnostic tracks (write test #1) [Bavarese].
- 0.162              : Provides IRQ / (B)DRQ signals. Honors DRIVE_READY and WRITE FAULT (DRDY / WF) now. Set WF to GND and DRDY to VCC in your driver if signals are not serviced [Karl-Ludwig Deisenhofer].
- 0.154              : Converted WD2010 to DEVCB2 [Osso].
- 0.148u2            : Moved mess\machine\wd2010.c/h to emu\machine\ [Curt Coder].

I9.23  IMI 5000H
- 0.153              : Moved machine\imi5000h.c/h to bus\imi7000\imi5000h.c/h.
- 0.149u1            : Added skeleton for IMI 5000H hard disk controller [Curt Coder, Al Kossow].

I9.3   IDE

- 0.186              : Added save states to machine\gt64xxx.cpp, removed address map trampolines and cap memory space mapping to physical memory bounds (machine\gt64xxx.cpp) [Ted Green].
- 0.175              : Added CHS and LBA limits when the CHD doesn't contain identify device data (machine\idehd.cpp) [smf].
- 0.174              : Added DMA control and proper PCI address mapping to machine\gt64xxx.cpp. Added PCI stall functions (machine\gt64xxx.cpp) [Ted Green].
- 0.172              : Added machine\gt64xxx.cpp/h. Added skeleton for Galileo System Controller [Ted Green].
- 0.170              : Respond to command SECURITY DISABLE PASSWORD (machine\idehd.cpp) [yz70s].
- 0.167              : Small comment changes (machine\idectrl.c) [yz70s].
- 0.164              : Decrease IDE read fill-time to avoids timeouts (machine\idehd.c). This fixed "HDD ERROR" after initial test in bm1stmix and other (MT#05318) [Peter Ferrie].
- 0.163              : Increase IDE fill-time to avoid missed interrupts (machine\idehd.c) [Peter Ferrie].
- 0.158              : Added missing save states to machine\idehd.c, fixes kinst.c save state regression [Osso].
- 0.155              : Added Read Native Max Address IDE command (machine\atahle.h, machine\idehd.c) [Barry Rodewald].
- 0.153              : Changed mess\machine\isa_ide.c/h to bus\isa\ide.c/h and mess\machine\isa_xtide.c/h to bus\isa\xtide.c/h. Simplified imagedev\harddriv.c and removed some legacy leftovers [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.152              : Tweaks to the idehd timing, which are still based on complete fiction (machine\idehd.c). Stops atari logo flickering in Area 51 (R3000). Calculate seek time using tracks rather than sectors, assuming that reading any sector on the current track will already be in the drives cache. Zeros m_cur_lba when the drive is reset for consistency (running kinst in a debug build took 30 seconds to start) (machine\idehd.c). Fix for divide by zero, if there is no CHD [smf].
- 0.151              : Changed IDE read sector timing to be the same as read multiple instead of write sector (machine\idehd.c) [smf].
- 0.150              : Changed machine\isa_ide8.c/h to machine\isa_xtide.c/h. IDE documentation for PC-9801 [Angelo Salese]. Fixed ATA addressing in machine\isa_ide8.c, reduced rom space to 8k (as that is all the XTIDE v1 supported) and added all the v1 compatible roms. Use 2864 for ROM. This allows XTIDECFG to flash the rom. Tested with 2.0.0 beta 3. You must disable SDP because eeprompar doesn't emulate it & you must load from a file as if you load from EEPROM then it only finds zeros (machine\isa_xtide.c). Renamed IDE8 to XTIDE [smf].
- 0.149u1            : Added machine\vt83c461.c/h. If there is no drive selected then there is nothing to read from, although not sure what value this expect to receive (machine\idectrl.c). Moved the buffer from the IDE controller to the device. Moved more state from idectrl.h. Moved password fields off the IDE controller. Moved block_count to the device, renamed some IDE commands to make them closer to the spec & also use the block count for triggering the first irq on read/write multiple. Either I misunderstand the spec or the code but judge dredd doesn't like this change. Moved a couple more variables. A couple more over the fence. Fixed crash if no disk. Fishin' Frenzy has no hard drive at all and prefers this value (return 0xff). Allow more than one IDE controller on the same device. 'Area 51: Site' doesn't like the same value as Fishin' Frenzy, maybe there is a difference between the value you get for no drives at all and no current drive. Moved the Error register, status, command, status timer and reset timer across. Splitted hard drive emulation from the IDE controller. Simplified ide_device_interface (machine\idehd.c). Derive Chihiro's baseboard ide from IDE mass storage device (machine\idehd.c). Simplified idehd status flags & fixed ct486 booting in MESS. Fixed crash when reading from non existent hard drive (machine\idehd.h). Changed "features" to "identify device". Don't set DRDY immediately when executing identify device as a timer is fired that will set it and trigger an interrupt anyway. Diagnostics fail if no identify device response is available. Set correct register contents at reset. Added edge detection to reset. Clear irq as soon as reset is triggered. Don't clear DRDY when resetting. Only call update_irq if something changed. Removed some places that were setting sector count. Added some #defines for masking bit fields (machine\idectrl.c, idehd.c, drivers\chihiro.c, cobra.c, kinst.c, taitotz.c and viper.c). Fixed head incrementing when using CHS with 16 heads (machine\idehd.c). Removed read_key() from ide_mass_storage_device as it's only used by ataflash and that was also reading the key in manually (machine\ataflash.c, idehd.c, drivers\chihiro.c). Added device number in logs, fixed issues with status flags that was causing FreeBSD to fail to boot with two drives (achine\idehd.c). Added ata_interface_device, ide_controller_device is now only for pc register mapping. Renamed ide_mass_storage_device to ata_mass_storage_device. Changed ide_hdd_device so it only picks up it's image from the harddisk_image_device, which does a lookup to see if there is a region itself (emu\imagedev\harddriv.c, ataflash.h, idectrl.c/h, idehd.c/h, machine.mak, drivers\atlantis.c, calchase.c, chihiro.c, cobra.c, djmain.c, extrema.c, fruitpc.c, funkball.c, gamecstl.c, globalvr.c, iteagle.c, jaguar.c, kinst.c, maygayep.c, mediagx.c, midqslvr.c, midvunit.c, photoply.c, pinball2k.c, pyson.c, qdrmfgp.c, quakeat.c, queen.c, savquest.c, seattle.c, taitogn.c, taitotz.c, twinkle.c, vegas.c, viper.c, voyager.c, vp101.c, zn.c, includes\djmain.h and qdrmfgp.h). Added vt83c461, which is currently implemented as a 32 bit chip. This allows hooking up to the jaguar driver without any glue, but primal rage 2 does as the io bus it's connected to is only 16 bit. Only build the identify buffer on the first reset, so patches made by the driver aren't lost if the device is reset. Fixed issues that caused the HD to report that the diagnostics failed (machine\idehd.c and drivers\chihiro.c). Log unknown writes (machine\idehd.c). Moved identify buffer manipulation and master/user password setting from ata interface to the ata mass storage device. These should be stored in the CHD (emu\machine\atadev.c/h, ataintf.c/h, idehd.c/h, drivers\cobra.c, djmain.c, kinst.c, taitotz.c and viper.c). Make sure identify buffer is initialised (machine\idehd.c). Added IDE_CONTROLLER_32 for systems that have 32 bit prefetch. Don't update irq/dmarq unless they change (machine\ataintf.c). Uses one timer instead of anonymous timers, so that resetting the device will stop any outstanding work. BSY is always set when waiting for the busy timer to fire. Implemented DASP & PDIAG functionality, device 1 is detected during reset & if device 1 fails diagnostic then device 0 sets bit 7 of it's diagnostic result. Ide cards now default to 1 hard disk, otherwise device 1 without a chd will cause device 0 to report a controller error (AMIBIOS for example doesn't allow booting from device 0 if device 1 fails). Timing of DASP & PDIAG is set very short because of lack of wait states when accessing ATA bus. Improved SRST functionality, which has meant viper needed to be changed to trigger a hard reset instead of a soft reset. Writes to the command register are now ignored with BSY or DRQ is set (packet devices can accept the DEVICE RESET command but they are not supported yet) [smf]. Forgot the secret ingredient (machine\idehd.h) [R. Belmont].
- 0.149              : Added machine\idehd.c/h. Started to split IDE HD from IDE controller. Merged the MAME and MESS IDE HD device. Moved where cur_drive is updated & changed PCMCIA trampoline definition to 16 bit. Moved handlers into the ide_controller_device. First pass at tidying up IDE interface. It no longer tries to force everything to act as a PC. A copy of the VIA VT83C461 datasheet would be useful to remove some of the hacks added to make the games using it work again. Created a new device for the bus master IDE controller, but the implementation is still in the IDE controller (machine\idectrl.c/h, drivers\chihiro.c, seattle.c and vegas.c). Started to separate the bus master DMA from the drive emulation (machine\idectrl.c/h and drivers\zn.c). Decoupled the IDE bus master emulation from the hard drive emulation (machine\idectrl.c). Converted machine\idectrl.c to device_timer() [smf].
- 0.148u5            : Changed I/O to 8/16 bit & removed the flash trampolines in the driver (machine\idectrl.c) [smf].
- 0.148u4            : Added machine\isa_ide8.c/h. XT IDE interface [Phill Harvey-Smith].
- 0.148u2            : Words 57/58 of IDENTIFY DEVICE are total sectors, not sectors per track (machine\idectrl.c). As commented, this is the case for ATA-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5. The CFFA2 Apple II IDE card firmware relies on this value being as documented in the standards to properly detect the drive size, and none of the usual sensitive Atari/Midway games are broken by the change (This field is unused in ATA-6 and later) [R. Belmont]. Fixed for ide_controller_device class for most uninitialized variables [Samuele Zannoli].
- 0.148u1            : Fixed regression in Fishin' Frenzy without breaking Area 51 Site 4 (machine\idectrl.c) [Peter Ferrie].
- 0.148              : Peter Ferrie fixed phantom slave drive detection problem (machine\idectrl.c).
- 0.147u2            : smf cleaned up the IDE controller enough to change the irq to a DEVCB2 and changed DEVICE_SELF_OWNER to DEVICE_SELF in IDE config & in MCFG_IDE_CONTROLLER_ADD add the IDE controller after the slots (audio\jaguar, drivers\atlantis.c, calchase.c, chihiro.c, cobra.c, djmain.c, funkball.c, gamecstl.c, jaguar.c, kinst.c, mediagx.c, midqslvr.c, midvunit.c, qdrmfgp.c, queen.c, savquest.c, seattle.c, taitogn.c, taitotz.c, taitowlf.c, twinkle.c, vegas.c, viper.c, voyager.c, xtom3d.c and zn.c).
- 0.147              : More proper solution for not connected IDE devices [Miodrag Milanovic]. Support IDE command 0x31 (IDE_COMMAND_WRITE_MULTIPLE_NORETRY) [Phil Bennett].
- 0.146u4            : Fix for MT bug #04844 (black screen after EEPROM initialize in Fishin' Frenzy), no need to clear status if drive not connected [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.145u4            : idectrl change [Carl].
- 0.145u1            : IDE controller now support two slots, currently used devices are made as slot devices [Miodrag Milanovic]. Note that rom regions for disks are now changed in order to support multiple connected drives in cases needed.
- 0.144u7            : Miodrag Milanovic fixed idectrl regression and clean it a bit.
- 0.144u6            : Miodrag Milanovic added support for 2 drives on IDE controller.
- 0.144u5            : Carl added delayed interrupts in idectrl to enable booting on some older BIOSes.
- 0.143u1            : Implemented command 0x70 (SEEK) makes jdredd and jdreddb boot again (idectrl.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.142u5            : Carl clears error status on driver initialization (idectrl.c). Implemented verify no retry command.
- 0.142u3            : Updated idectrl to react on IDE_COMMAND_ATAPI_IDENTIFY it is returning same content as case IDE_COMMAND_GET_INFO, disks are being identified by 586 drivers in MESS. Added 0xE3 command to idectrl, ATAPI identify should not work for hard disk, so updated unknown commands always to return IDE_ERROR_UNKNOWN_COMMAND, this way at586 driver boots (machine\idectrl.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.132u5            : Added IDE Lock mechanism to the IDE Driver in MAME, so games on gnetv2 BIOS are working correct now (idectrl.c / idectrl.h) & taitogn.c [Joerg Hartenberger].
- 0.130u3            : Build the IDE features table only when there is a CHD available [Curt Coder].
- 0.128u5            : Aaron Giles removed cpunum_get_active(). Main important change is that IDE controllers with bus mastering (DMA) need to specify the target address space in the IDE device configuration.
- 0.126u4            : Aaron Giles changed the IDE interfaces to default to choosing the region with the same tag as the device for its master disk (assuming no slave). Added support for specifying explicit master/slave disk regions as part of the configuration, though slave disks are still not supported yet.
- 0.124u3            : Aaron Giles converted the IDE controller to a device. Updated all drivers accordingly.
- 0.79u2             : Nathan Woods added ide_bus_0_r() call to access the bus directly.
-  9th February  2004: Nathan Woods sent in miscellaneous fixes to the IDE controller emulation.
- 0.78               : Aaron Giles fixed IDE controller final sector handling for Gauntlet: Dark Legacy and added new PIC mapping.
- 0.77u3             : Aaron Giles made sure the IDE controller in the Seattle games waits a minimum amount of time before generating an interrupt. The IDE controller features buffer is now filled in completely. Also fixed code that reads the bus master status register from a word offset. Nathan Woods added #ifndef <headername>_H protection (harddisk.h + chd.h).
- 0.69a              : IDE Update adding support for a few things needed in the future [Aaron Giles].
- 27th May       2003: Aaron Giles updated the IDE controller emulation to support a couple more commands and added DMA bus mastering support that will be necessary for the Seattle games.
- 0.69               : Added ide_controller_init_custom() (used by MESS) (src\idectrl.c) [Nathan Woods].
-  8th December  2002: Aaron Giles implemented compressed hard disk extraction and merging in the hdcomp tool, added support for various things in the IDE controller emulation.
- 0.59               : Added machine\idectrl.c/h.
-  8th March     2002: Aaron Giles added hard disk support and emulation for a standard IDE controller.

I9.4   ATA/ATAPI

- 0.183              : Added Play Audio MSF (0x47) command, used by Another CD Player and Astrocounter of Crescents (machine\t10mmc.cpp) [Barry Rodewald].
- 0.181              : Fixed issue with 68000 byte writes to sector count by only taking the bottom 8 bits from the bus (machine\atahle.cpp). Note: Don't use mem_mask as ATA doesn't have an equivalent mechanism for byte accesses and it could mask out data that real hardware would keep. Fixed ATA Write Multiple (command c5) ignoring the block count on the first block (machine\idehd.cpp) [smf].
- 0.180              : Made constructor protected in machine\atahle.h [smf].
- 0.179              : Added "headphones" to ATAPI CD-ROM drives [smf].
- 0.176              : Added ATAPI_FIXED_CDROM to Firebeat driver (machine\atapicdr.cpp) [Carl].
- 0.172              : Basic disk change support (machine\atapicdr.cpp) [Carl].
- 0.170              : Try to fix a problem when m_buffer_size is not a multiple of sector size (machine\atapihle.cpp). When reading sectors using the packet command, if the "Byte count limit" is not a multiple of the sector size, only a subset of the data will be transferred. It happens sometimes with the xbox [yz70s].
- 0.167              : Ultra DMA modes should be useable now (machine\atahle.c). Call routine fill_buffer using a timer to avoid reentering read_data and losing data with ultra DMA (machine\atahle.c). Call fill_buffer using a timer only when ultra DMA is enabled. Otherwise some drivers have problems [yz70s].
- 0.166              : Added method identify_device_buffer() to ATAPI CDROM (machine\atapicdr.h) like in idehd [yz70s].
- 0.164              : Added Check Power Mode command (machine\atahle.h and atapihle.c) [Ville Linde].
- 0.162              : Added clear cache command (machine\atahle.c) [Ted Green].
- 0.158              : Added missing save state to machine\atahle.c, fixes NFL Blitz '99 save state regression [Osso].
- 0.156              : smf fixed Otenki Kororin fails to boot into the game by reducing ATA flash card seek time to zero.
- 0.154              : Added CS1 active status register to machine\atahle.c [Curt Coder].
- 0.153              : Added support for 8 bit data transfers using the set features command, instead of using mem_mask as ATA doesn't work that way. Added a hack to get Taito GNET games working after 'added support for 8 bit data transfers'. More investigation is required to determine whether there is a latch when using 8 bit accesses or whether the limitation of fixed sized transfers is only applicable to the ATA bus and not flash cards that implement the ATA protocol [smf].
- 0.152              : Added machine().describe_context() to debugging code (machine\ataintf.c). Set the error bit in the IDE status register if the command causes a check condition. Fixed enum, didn't mean to click ok on commit earlier as I was still clean building (machine\atapihle.c) [smf].
- 0.151              : Added emu\machine\cdu76s.c/h, t10mmc.c/h, t10sbc.c/h and t10spc.c/h. Use virtual multiple inheritance to share command processing between SCSI & ATAPI instead of having a SCSI subdevice. This allows matsushita_cr589_device & gdrom_device to derive from atapi_cdrom_device. Fixed machine\atahle.c. This fixed "disk error" after rom check in bm1stmix and other. Changed atapicdr packet identify to Virtual CDROM because not all images are compressed & the text no longer starts in the middle of the vendor name (software displaying the vendor name used to display "MAME Com"). Added a cdu76s device so that the inquiry for the generic ATAPI and SCSI CDROM drives can also be set to "Virtual CDROM". However none of the Konami GV games care, so I'm not sure which game required that response & that is the only Konami SCSI CD based system. The response is invalid according to the SCSI spec as the strings should be space filled and not null terminated & there are fields not filled in. So it's currently compiled in but not used. Added m_buffer_size = IDE_DISK_SECTOR_SIZE to machine\ataflash.c. This fixed boot error message in Taito G-NET games spuzbobl, spuzboblj and Usagi [smf].
- 0.150              : Added machine\atahle.c/h, atapicdr.c/h and atapihle.c/h. Replaced ISA16_IDE_CD with ATAPI_CDROM, replaced ISA16_IDE & ISA16_IDE_CD in southbridge_device with two BUS_MASTER_IDE_CONTROLLERs. Removed local ATAPI code in preparation to use the new code, but the CPU gets lost after executing the first instruction (drivers\gammagic.c). Refactored to use ATA_INTERFACE (drivers\firebeat.c and ksys573.c). Preliminary ATAPI/Dreamcast DMA. The timing needs to be moved into the devices, so the timing hack can be removed from the driver (machine\atapihle.c and mess\machine\dccons.c). Preliminary SET FEATURES support. Only set transfer mode is currently supported, but this checks/sets flags in the identify device buffer. The buffer has been moved up into atahle and the idehd has been changed to work with words instead of bytes (emu\machine\atahle.c/h, atapihle.c/h, idehd.c/h, drivers\cobra.c, kinst.c, taitotz.c, viper.c and machine\gdrom.c) [smf].
- 0.149u1            : Added machine\atadev.c/h and ataintf.c/h.
- 0.149u1            : ATA flash device derives from IDE HDD device and added pccard interface, instead of using an IDE controller. Moved the GNET protection command processing to ataflash.c. Removed read_key() from ide_mass_storage_device as it's only used by ataflash and that was also reading the key in manually (machine\ataflash.c, idehd.c, drivers\chihiro.c) [smf].
- 0.149              : Added Split RF5C296 and ATA flash functionality from Taito G-NET driver into their own devices. The pccard slot has had to revert to use memory handlers instead of device maps for the moment [smf].
- 0.148u2            : Added machine\ataflash.c/h. altstatus reset to ATAPI CD (mess\machine\isa_ide_cd.c) [Carl].
- 0.147u3            : Some additional ATAPI support to Firebeat driver [PKGINKGO].
- 0.142u3            : Updated idectrl to react on IDE_COMMAND_ATAPI_IDENTIFY it is returning same content as case IDE_COMMAND_GET_INFO, disks are being identified by 586 drivers in MESS. Added 0xE3 command to idectrl, ATAPI identify should not work for hard disk, so updated unknown commands always to return IDE_ERROR_UNKNOWN_COMMAND, this way at586 driver boots (machine\idectrl.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.125u5            : Firebeat driver update [Aaron Giles]: Added VBLANK IRQ clear. Added ATAPI IRQ clear. Tried to add UART IRQ clear but it doesn't yet work. Most of the games start to show something again with these changes. Added fast RAM region.

I9.5   SCSI

- 0.188              : Improved NCR 5390 SCSI: Improved initiator transfer information logic. Split transfer count/counter. Added rudimentary 53c90a/53c94 support. Reworked initiator transfer information state machine: should now support all SCSI phases. Improved handling of dma/non-dma commands. Added an undocumented hack to make (MESS) InterPro work. Match updated 5390 device. Inherit memory map. Implemented interrupt status flag in status register for 53c90a, this is critical for (MESS) InterPro. Improved tcounter and dma/drq handling [Patrick Mackinlay].
- 0.187              : Basic 53c94 support for (MESS) InterPro 2800 (machine\ncr5390.cpp). SCSI DMA improvements [Patrick Mackinlay].
- 0.183              : Added Play Audio MSF (0x47) command, used by Another CD Player and Astrocounter of Crescents (machine\t10mmc.cpp) [Barry Rodewald].
- 0.180              : Implemented 'selection disable' (machine\ncr5390.cpp) [O. Galibert].
- 0.173              : Skip disc change detection (machine\cr589.h). This fixed all KSYS573 sets no longer work when attempting to test the CD hardware [Carl].
- 0.160              : Moved machine\omti5100.c/h to bus\scsi. (MESS) Siemens PC-D keyboard and partial SCSI [Carl].
- 0.155              : Sync rest of lines with input buffer (bus\scsi\scsi.c) [Carl].
- 0.154              : Removed machine\scsibus.c/h, scsicb.c/h and scsidev.c/h. Added bus\scsi\scsi.c/h and machine\legscsi.c/h. Moved emu\machine\cdu76s.c/h, scsicd.c/h, scsihd.c/h and scsihle.c/h to emu\bus\scsi\. Added some missing save state entries (machine\ncr5390.c, nscsi_bus.c, nscsi_cd.c and nscsi_hd.c) [O. Galibert]. SCSI Port using WRITELINE and DEVCB2. The slot number and SCSI ID are separate so you can for example have -harddisk1 as ID 6 and -harddisk 2 as ID 5. The HLE'd CD & HD have configuration switches to set the ID, real emulated hardware will specify the ID using it's own method. Added SCSI ID configuration to sa1403d as it's HLE'd but adds it's own DIP switches [smf]. Synchronized the data output lines with the input buffer device (bus\scsi\scsi.c). (MESS) RM Nimbus: Make SCSI work [Carl].
- 0.153              : Converted WD33c93 to DEVCB2 [Osso].
- 0.152              : Added machine\nscsi_cb.c/h and nscsi_s1410.c/h. Fixed hard disk images with 256-byte sectors (machine\t10sbc.c). Added nscsi versions of the SCSI callback device and Xebec S1410 [Curt Coder]. Fixed D9060 format. Reads greater than one sector were broken when using bit banging (machine\scsihle.c). Added SCSI status code & set it in all command handlers. It is sent over the bus when in status phase. In case of an error further information should be set in m_sense_key/m_sense_asc/m_sense_ascq & m_sense_information so that it can be returned by executing a request sense command (emu\bus\ieee488\d9060hd.c, machine\cdu76s.c, cr589.c, scsihle.c/h, t10mmc.c, t10sbc.c, t10spc.c, t10spc.h and mame\machine\gdrom.c). Fixed compiling with MSVC and added enums for T10 commands. Added a work round so that CR589 firmware updating works again, either from the separate CD's or as part of the game install (for example DDR MAX) [smf].
- 0.151              : Added emu\machine\t10mmc.c/h, t10sbc.c/h and t10spc.c/h. Moved mess\machine\ncr5380n.c/h to emu\machine\. Use virtual multiple inheritance to share command processing between SCSI & ATAPI instead of having a SCSI subdevice. This allows matsushita_cr589_device & gdrom_device to derive from atapi_cdrom_device. Moved the adaptec mode sense handling into the ACB4070 device (machine\scsihle.c and mess\machine\acb4070.c). Moved request sense command into t10spc, supporting the old obsolete format and the new one. Fixed read TOC to always return the lead out & return the correct results for msf requests. Mounting the same iso in Windows 8 produces a slightly different result, but it's enough to make windows 2000 recovery console and Windows 95a work. Fixed bugs in new toc reading code, when the request wasn't from the first track (machine\t10mmc.c). Uses the sff8020 read toc legacy format field if the mmc format field is zero (MSCDEX uses the sff8020 format field instead of the mmc format field). Added support for session format for read toc, we only support 1 session so the data is mostly hard coded. Fixed read sub command when subq bit was not set (machine\t10mmc.c). Fixed read sub channel bug (fixes Dance Dance Revolution 2nd Mix) (machine\t10mmc.c) [smf]. Better DRQ support, fixed arbitration-in-progress bit (machine\ncr5380n.c). Improved /BSY behavior on arbitration (machine\ncr5380n.c) [R. Belmont].
- 0.150              : Fixed space in SCSI_CR589 device shortname [Tafoid]. Store firmware in NVRAM (machine\cr589.c) [smf].
- 0.149              : Converted NCR5380N and NCR5390 to DEVCB2 & use MCFG_DEVICE_CLOCK to set SCSI chip clock [smf].
- 0.148u4            : State cleanup and some modernization (machine\wd33c93.c and drivers\cps3.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.148u2            : Added mess\machine\ncr5380n.c/h. Reimplemented the NCR5380 SCSI controller using nscsi (mess\machine\ncr5380n.c). Added 6-byte WRITE, logging of unknown commands, and some Apple-specific SCSI tweaks (emu\machine\nscsi_hd.c) [R. Belmont].
- 0.148              : Oliver Stöneberg fixed uninitialized members in wd33c93.c (MESS: Fixes ip225015 crash).
- 0.147u4            : Set interface name to SCSI harddisks so they can be mounted as softlist items. Added interface for SCSI CDROM, but named it "cdrom" since medium is always same (machine\nscsi_cd.c, nscsi_hd.c, scsicd.c and scsihd.c) [smf].
- 0.147u3            : Added STOP command to SCSI CD [PKGINKO].
- 0.147u2            : Removed some old commented out code (machine\scsihle.c/h). Default all lines high & improved logging (machine\scsicb.c/h). Added output logging (machine\scsidev.c). Added the device tag when logging that no harddrive is found (machine\scsihd.c). Delays the req signal and disabled logging left on by accident (machine\scsihle.c). Uses logical levels rather than voltage levels for control signals, you have to write 0 to the data lines when you're not sending data. Added a kludge to stop the ff from the 6522 from preventing the bus from being read, this may or may not be how the hardware really works (machine\scsibus.c, scsicb.c, scsidev.c and scsihle.c). Switched SCSICB to use DEVCB2. SCSICD now has a CDDA sub device [smf].
- 0.147u1            : Changed machine\scsidev.c/h to machine\scsihle.c/h. Moved some more SCSI command handling from scsibus into scsidev. Removed init_scsibus() from scsibus_device as it was only used for passing the sector size, in reality this is an attribute of the hard drive and not the bus. It now asks the device for the size, however this will go away soon. Created new base class for SCSI devices which scsihle derives from. Talking to scsibus is now done via scsicb. Call base class in device_start(). Moved extra SCSI_PHASE_* into scsihle.h. Changed rmnimbus to use DEVCB & added a callback for ACK. Added atn to scsicb for completeness & renamed reset line to rst. Moved SCSI protocol code from scsibus_device to scsihle_device, leaving scsibus_device to calculate the current bus contents and distribute it to each of the scsidev_device. Started thinking about how multi-endpoint devices will work, using a hierarchy has too many limitations (machine\scsibus.c) [smf]. Fixed VS2012 warnings in machine\scsicb.c [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.147              : Changed machine\scsi.c/h to machine\scsibus.c/h. Added machine\scsicb.c/h. Glacial SCSI improvements towards NSCSI and beyond, moved the SCSI ID onto the device. Turned WD33C93 into a device and made CPS3 flash roms optional on CD sets. Use device_t.static_set_static_config (emu\machine\wd33c93.c). SCSI device tags are relative to the SCSI controller. Removed SCSIConfigTable, SCSI devices are now linked using SCSIBUS from MESS. Made S1410 device act as a SCSIHD with the custom commands, added D9060HD & ACB4070 devices to do the same thing (machine\scsibus.c and scsihd.c). Split out callbacks from scsibus_device into scscb_device, eventually this will be a SCSI device. SCSIBus_interface is no longer required and has been removed. Removed test ready command as scsidev already handles it (machine\scsibus.c/h) [smf].
- 0.146u5            : Added docs\nscsi.txt. NSCSI documentation [O. Galibert].
- 0.146u1            : SCSI devices are now proper MAME devices [Phill W.]. Made NSCSI use fixed slots support in core [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.145u4            : Write and mode sense support in nscsi_hd. Misc fixes [O. Galibert]. Dir works on CD's now (machine\scsicd.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.145u1            : Added machine\nscsi_bus.c/h, nscsi_cd.c/h and nscsi_hd.c/h. New modern object-oriented bus-signals-available SCSI implementation [O. Galibert].
- 0.144u7            : Curt Coder fixed SCSI hard disk allocation. This fixed Crypt Killer crashes MAME before it can display the disclaimer.
- 0.144u5            : Get sector size from CHD metadata to support old 256 bytes/sector SCSI drives, and allow hard disk image subdevices (scsihd.c) [Curt Coder].
- 0.124u2            : R. Belmont reverted previous SCSI CD change which broke some games.
- 0.135u2            : Harmony added support for SCSI command 0x2a (Write w/ 32-bit LBA), upped input buffer size in WD33C93 controller.
- 0.135              : R. Belmont fixed scsihd don't crash if no media is attached.
- 0.134u4            : scsihd updates [R. Belmont]: Fixed parameter interpretation for READ(10) and READ(12). Added WRITE(10).
- 0.126u4            : Disks opened by the romload module are no longer identified by index. Instead, they are identified by the region they were loaded in. This generally means one disk per region. get_disk_handle() now takes a region name in place of an index. Updated all callers to do this. The SCSI modules in particular posed a challenge to make this work, so watch out for potential bugs there [Aaron Giles].
- 0.124u2            : R. Belmont reverted previous SCSI CD change which broke some games.
- 0.124u1            : Various SCSI devices register state items by their disk ID, which are not unique across device types. Introduced a device-type offset for CD-ROMs so their registrations don't clash with harddisks [R. Belmont].
- 0.124              : R. Belmont fixed SCSI case when no device exists (e.g. running the sys573 BIOS directly).
- 0.122u2            : Oliver Stoenberg fixed several memory leaks related to SCSI CD emulation.
- 0.120u2            : Added machine\scsi.c/h, scsidev.c, scsihd.h, scsicd.h and machine\cr589.c/h. smf added support for CR-589 firmware to the System 573 driver. Made substantial changes to the SCSI support, making it require fewer hacks, and allowing one device to be derived from another.
- 0.118u3            : Added machine\wd33c93.c/h. Ernesto Corvi added a fairly complete WD33C93 SCSI controller emulation, and also updated the cps3.c driver to use it.
- 0.110u4            : SCSI CD emulation improvements [Ville Linde]: Added Play Audio (12) command. Fixed track number and added MSF support to Read Sub-Channel command.
- 0.109u5            : R. Belmont improved behavior of SCSI CD implementation for audio playback and TOC reading commands.
- 0.99u3             : SCSI hard disk updates [R. Belmont]: Added FORMAT UNIT, READ (6 byte), WRITE (6 byte), READ (12 byte), MODE SENSE and READ CAPACITY commands. Changed INQUIRY to ID as a real Seagate model, which makes MacOS much happier than a manufacturer code of "MAME". Added some MESS-specific tweeks to initialization.
- 0.96u2             : R. Belmont and Ville Linde fixed a number of bugs and added support for more SCSI commands and modes.
- 0.95               : Added machine\scsihd.c, scsicd.c and scsidev.h.
-  8th January   2004: R. Belmont - Fixed a bunch of bugs all around GV, the SCSI controller, and other bits. Hyper Athlete now has all it's men in MAME and is fully playable, and the corrupted graphics in Wedding Rhapsody are fixed (it's a quiz game). Also figured out the problem with Susume Taisen Puzzle-dama in MAME, and Simpsons Bowling no longer freezes and just needs the trackballs hooked up to be fully playable.

I9.51  53CF96

- 0.149              : Fixed uninitialized variable and added range checking, which prevents visual studio 64 bit debug builds from crashing (machine\am53cf96.c). Apple GCC complained about "warning: comparison is always true due to limited range of data type". Deleting/Update code [smf].
- 0.147              : Removed am53cf96_get_device and some other unused GetDevice() trampolines. AM53cf96 is now a device. Use device_t.static_set_static_config. SCSI device tags are relative to the SCSI controller (machine\am53cf96.c) [smf].
- 0.95               : R. Belmont changed konamigv and konamigq drivers to support the new 53cf96 configuration system. AM53cf96.c is now fully configurable: you can have any combination of up to 7 CD-ROMs and/or harddisks attached to the emulated SCSI bus and specify what each one's SCSI ID is. CD-ROM emulation expanded to support more SCSI commands and bugfix some existing ones. Moved actual CD-ROM and harddisk device emulation out of am53cf96.c to new scsicd.c and scsihd.c files. CD-ROM emulation expanded to support more SCSI commands and bugfix some existing ones.
- 0.80u3             : R. Belmont added preliminary CD-ROM support for CHDMAN. CDROM support for the AM53cf96 SCSI controller.
- 0.78               : Added machine\am53cf96.c/h. NCR 53CF96-2 SCSI controller emulation [R. Belmont].

I9.52  53C700

- 0.186              : Changed name '53C7xx SCSI' to 'NCR 53C7xx SCSI'.
- 0.149              : Added support for machine config fragments that are applied when the cart is loaded, converted NCR 53C7xx to DEVCB2 as an example [smf].
- 0.148u2            : Preliminary 53c7xx save state support [A. Viloria].
- 0.148              : Added machine\53c7xx.c/h. Added preliminary emulation of the NCR 53C700 SCSI I/O processor [Phil Bennett].

I9.53  53C810

- 0.155              : Reading 53C810 DSTAT clears DIP bit in ISTAT [Ville Linde].
- 0.154              : Updated 53C810 to use delegates, and moved some formerly static stuff into Model3 and (MESS) BeBox classes.
- 0.129u5            : Couriersud added register SXFER (0x05) to the 53c810 - nothing more. This reg determines SCSI transfer speeds. scud / scuda now fatalerror with writes to reg # 0x70. Converted 53c810 to a C++ device [smf].
- 0.125u5            : Aaron Giles changed 53C810 SCSI controller read/write handles to proper READ8/WRITE8_HANDLER callbacks so they can eventually be used directly.
- 0.125u4            : R. Belmont updated the 53c810 SCSI adapter to pass IRQ state with the IRQ callback.
- 0.102              : Began adding support for SCRIPTS programs to the 53C810 emulation [Nathan Woods, R. Belmont].
- 0.101u1            : Tomas Karlsson integrated 53C810 into the SCSI framework.
- 0.99u3             : Ville Linde fixed recent LSI53C810 update which caused the Model 3 games to crash.
- 0.97u5             : Nathan Woods abstracted memory interfaces and improved 53C810 SCSI emulation.
- 0.90u2             : Ville Linde fixed 53c810 SCSI single-stepping mode DMA and added memory moves and DMA callback.
-  3rd January   2005: Ville Linde - Fixed some bugs in the SCSI emulation, and now 3D graphics is also working in Virtua Fighter 3, Sega Bass Fishing, Scud Race and the Step 1.5 versions of Virtua Striker 2 and VS2 '98. There are still a lot of glitches and crashing though.
- 0.89u3             : Added machine\53c810.c/h. Preliminary 53c810 SCSI emulation [Ville Linde]. Lost World now tries to download everything necessary to the Real3D stuff.

9.54  NCR539x

- 0.155              : Added asserts for index out-of-bounds access with (MESS) Sun 3x/80. Adjusted an ncr539x_device assert [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.154              : Converted NCR539x to DEVCB2 [Osso]. Fixed FIFO read/writing to work as expected [R. Belmont].
- 0.147              : SCSI device tags are relative to the SCSI controller (machine\ncr539x.c) [smf].
- 0.144              : Added machine\ncr539x.c/h. Rewrote NCR539x SCSI emulation from scratch [R. Belmont].

9.55  MB89352

- 0.187              : Improved CD audio play track/index command handling (machine\mb89352.cpp and t10mmc.cpp). kokoroj2 needs mods in the MB89352 core that won't break (MESS) Sharp X68000 as well. kokoroj2 requires the printer interface, a command to stop current track is sent with CD & printer disabled in dipswitches [smf].
- 0.186              : Base MB89352 SCSI hookup in Soreike Kokology Vol. 2 - Kokoro no Tanteikyoku, disabled by default [Angelo Salese].
- 0.154              : Converted MB89352 to DEVCB2 [Osso]. Get the correct MB89352 phase [Carl].
- 0.148u2            : Fixed uninitialized members [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.147              : Added machine\mb89352.c/h. Merge of MESS sources [Miodrag Milanovic]. Glacial SCSI improvements towards NSCSI and beyond, moved the SCSI id onto the device. SCSI device tags are relative to the SCSI controller [smf].

I9.6   ISA

- 0.188              : Added unmap_device method and in install16_device use I/O space width (bus\isa\isa.cpp) [yz70s].
- 0.185              : Provide proper unitmask for address spaces of any data width (bus\isa\isa.h) [AJR].
- 0.179              : Fixed load stuff for Mitsumi ISA CDROM Adapter and vis links loads all the way now (isa\mcd.cpp) [Carl].
- 0.177              : Check get_card_device before using. This fixed crash/exception at initialization in various machines using ISA [Carl].
- 0.154              : Converted ISA8 and ISA16 devices to DEVCB2 [Osso]. (MESS) Apollo updates: Fixed ISA bus endianness, it's the same as other 680x0 systems with ISA. Improved logging in several places. "20 years ago" option updated to now-necessary "25 years ago". Fixed ISA high IRQ routing. Fixed 3c505 to have a 16 bit ISA interface. Fixed omti8621 and sc499 to have correct-endian ISA interfaces [Hans Ostermeyer].
- 0.153              : Changed mess\machine\isa.c/h to bus\isa\isa.c/h and mess\machine\isa_dectalk.c/h to bus\isa\dectalk.c/h. Added bus\isa\side116.c/h and mufdc.c/h. ISA bus can now use its own address spaces instead of taking over a CPU's. This is completely untested for 16-bit buses, but it works well for 8-bit (stand by for demo commit). Cleaned up 16-bit handling now thanks to a test case. (MESS) Preliminary hookup of ISA bus, peripherals and MFP to Indiana University 68030 board. As noted, it puts lots of text in the VGA framebuffer which is never displayed. Something off-spec with how the VGA is being accessed? Converted (MESS) Apollo to use real ISA bus [R. Belmont]. Added IDE controller to (MESS) Indiana University 68030, fixed 16-bit ISA I/O (machine\isa.c) [R. Belmont, Carl]. Added support for the Acculogic sIDE-1/16 8-bit ISA card (this card goes into an 8-bit slot, but allows the use of 16 bit AT IDE drives). Added preliminary support for the Multi Unique type ISA FDC cards [Dirk Best]. Removed a pit trampoline (machine\isa_ibm_mfc.c) [smf]. Shuffle ISA and some more PC related devices around. Finished modernizing ISA [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.151              : Added machine\isa_dectalk.c/h. Added the DECTalk PC device. Audio quality is currently marginal [Carl, Lord Nightmare]. Much better now although quieter and some pops and squeaks [Carl].
- 0.150              : Removed machine\isa_ide_cd.c/h. Replaced ISA16_IDE_CD with ATAPI_CDROM, replaced ISA16_IDE & ISA16_IDE_CD in southbridge_device with two BUS_MASTER_IDE_CONTROLLERs. Refactored to use ATA_INTERFACE (drivers\firebeat.c). Preliminary ATAPI/Dreamcast DMA. The timing needs to be moved into the devices, so the timing hack can be removed from the driver (machine\atapihle.c and mess\machine\dccons.c). Preliminary SET FEATURES support. Only set transfer mode is currently supported, but this checks/sets flags in the identify device buffer. The buffer has been moved up into atahle and the idehd has been changed to work with words instead of bytes (machine\atahle.c/h, atapihle.c/h, idehd.c/h, drivers\cobra.c, kinst.c, taitotz.c, viper.c and machine\gdrom.c) [smf]. Added some comments (machine\isa.h). Flagged a few more things as deprecated (machine\isa.h) [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.149u1            : PC driver cleanup: Added support for the IOCHCK signal to the ISA bus, this is used instead of directly issuing an NMI to the main CPU. Moved ISA device slot definitions to its own file to avoid copy & pasting the same list to different drivers [Dirk Best]. Fixed regression (machine\isa_cards.c) [Curt Coder].
- 0.148u3            : Don't set intreason_io in data out phase (machine\isa_ide_cd.c). WARP installer sees the CDROM now. NOTE: Only the OS/2 WARP CD-ROM version works for now as the floppies use the XDF format which apparently use variable sectors per track and so AFAIK won't work for now [Carl].

-  2nd December  2003: Aaron Giles - Well, I finally decided to figure out what the heck was up with California Speed. Turns out there were a few subtle problems in the PCI configuration code when setting up the 3dfx card. With that fixed, I was able to map the proper self-test button, and finally hook up all the controls. Then came some ugly sound synchronization issues. Like Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey, this game won't boot unless the sound is working. After some fiddling, I was able to get it to work. Unlike San Francisco Rush, this one starts up and is playable, though there are some obvious color issues (well, not so obvious here, but it is in other screen shots). However, it doesn't last too long until we hit a snag. Much like San Francisco Rush, we get some math errors and the game freaks out. I really hope this doesn't mean I have to add full floating point exception support....

I12.    Cassette / Cartridge / Floppy / Harddisk / CD / Laser Disc


I12.1   Cassette

- 0.175              : Fixed readonly cassette formats (imagede\cassette.cpp, tools\castool.cpp). Performs argument checking on the return value of CassetteLegacyWaveFiller.chunk_sample_calc() (formats\cassimg.cpp). This is just better error checking. You can see this if you create a garbage file named 'foo.csw' and invoke the following command: MAME bbcb -cass1 foo.csw. With this change you get an invalid image error. Without it, you get this: Caught unhandled St12length_error exception: vector::_M_default_append [Nathan Woods].

- 0.158              : Added bus\a8sio\a8sio.c/h and cassette.c/h. Added skeleton for Atari 8bit SIO bus. This will not work until pokey learns to speak low level serial. Some Atari 8bit cassette work, not working yet [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.155              : Correction to the (MESS) MC-1000 cassette input [Emerson Costa]. Fixed bug where systems with multiple cassette drives (e.g. PET) had no Tape Controls when no cassette was loaded in the first drive (ui\tapectrl.c). Added shortcut commands for Tape Start and Tape Stop, by default mapped to F2 and Shift+F2, respectively. This is not meant as a replacement for the internal Tape Control menu, but it shall make simpler the usage of game tapes in home computers. Notice that REC/RWD/FWD have still to be pressed from the internal UI and that if you mount multiple cassettes in a driver with multiple tape drives only the first one will be controllable with these shortcuts. The idea is that more complex actions (e.g. save you own BASIC program or copy programs from a tape to another, etc.) should be performed through the internal menu, while people just aiming to play games can use the shortcut. This commit requires probably a clean build (emu\inpttype.h, ioport.h and ui.c). Converted Atari VCS carts to be slot devices, cleaned up the implementation and removed Supercharger tapes from the main system. The -cass media switch (to load the tape file) will become available only when you mount the Supercharger cart [Fabio Priuli].

I12.21  Max-A-Flex
-  8th November  2004: Mariusz Wojcieszek - Wrote a driver for the Max-A-Flex system (Atari 600XL). Four titles have appeared on this platform officially only.
- NOTES: The Max-A-Flex system is basically an Atari 600XL computer inside an arcade cabinet, which uses game cartridges. There is additional hardware that controls the length of time that you may play the game. Each time you insert a quarter, an amount of time determined by dip switch settings on the controller board is added. While the timer is running, all controls are active and you can control the game via Start, Select, Option, an 8-way joystick and one button. When the timer gets down to 10 seconds of play remaining, the control board starts beeping a progressivly higher pitched beep and flashing the "insert coin" and "extend play" lights. When the timer gets to zero, the controls become non-functional, but the game does not reset, so you could add more coins and continue playing.
- GAMES: First Star Software - Astro Chase (1982), Bristles (1983), Boulder Dash (1984), Flip and Flop (1983)

- 0.169              : chdman info verbose metadata output [MetalliC]. When chdman wants only the original sectors from CHD-CD, give it only the original sectors (util\cdrom.cpp) [R. Belmont].
- 0.160              : Send error messages to stderr instead of stdout (chdtest.py). Open chdtest.py as binary, read in chunks to reduce memory usage. Make chdtest.py Python 3 compatible [Mike Naberezny]. Reduced the image size of some chdman createhd tests. Added some disabled debug code (chdman\chdtest.py) [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.159              : Report core file position in case of a CHD hunk read error (tools\chdman.c) [Juergen Buchmueller].
- 0.158              : Fixed ThreadSanitizer data race warnings (lib\util\chd.c). Bail out in chd_file::hunk_info() on unknown compression type. Added a few more chdman tests (chdman\input\createhd_2\in.params, createhd_3\in.params, output\createhd_2\out.chd and createhd_3\out.chd). Added -s/--size parameter for "createhd" to create blank harddisk based on size and sector size. Also added unit tests for the new option / moved filesize validation out of guess_chd() (chdman\input\createhd_4\in.params, createhd_5\in.params, output\createhd_4\out.chd and createhd_5/out.chd). Added missing catch in chd_file_compressor::async_read() and chdman main() (nw) happens when e.g. disk is full [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.156              : Fixed "make tools" with VS14 CTP4 [smf].
- 0.154              : CHD update: Bugfixed byte order for GD-ROM audio tracks so FLAC compression is effective. Fixed uninitialized struct on MSVC (and possibly other) builds. This will change the SHA1s of every GD-ROM CHD in MAME; a patch to reflect that is pending (the old images still work, they just take a little more space than is necessary). "chdman copy" suffices to upgrade; no downloading is necessary. Fixed uninitialized flags (util\cdrom.c). CHD cleanups: Double quote filenames with spaces when writing .gdi files. Give audio files .raw extension when writing .gdi files. cdrom_read_subcode() now returns false if the image doesn't contain subcodes [MetalliC]. Recreated yet again the CHDs from r30949 (no new sets) which all had different SHA1 hashes due to bugfixes with CHDMAN since 0.153 release [f205v].
- 0.153              : Added regtests\chdman\input\createcd_cue_audio_silence\in.bin, in.cue, createcd_cue_audio_silence_wav_20_tracks_none\in.cue, in.params, silence.wav, createcd_nrg_audio_silence\in.nrg, createhd_raw_empty_none\in.params, in.raw, output\createcd_cue_audio_silence\out.chd, createcd_cue_audio_silence_wav_20_tracks_none\out.chd, createcd_nrg_audio_silence\out.chd and createhd_raw_empty_none\out.chd. Added some more chdman tests - they had been sitting in my tree for a while, but I held off the commit because the input/output files are a bit bigger than the existing ones. Fixed UBSAN (Clang test) invalid vptr error with dynamic_array<hash_pair> in struct work_item (util\chd.c). chdtest.py might have reported, that all tests were successful even if one failed / cleanups and log the unsupported mode. Changed casing of FLAC folders to match official source distribution (flac->FLAC). Pass VERSION define via compiler flags to libflac. Re-enabled checks in libFLAC\memory.c. Removed definition of SIZE_MAX in libflac\include\share\alloc.h. Fixed reading of bits/sample in parse_wav_sample() on big-endian systems (util\chdcd.c). Changed HAVE_CONFIG_H checks in libflac to be as intended - will be fixed upstream as well [Oliver Stöneberg]. Fixed compile (tools\chdman.c) [Alex Jackson].
- 0.152              : Fix for MSVC "warning C4717: 'device_image_interface::fread' : recursive on all control paths, function will cause runtime stack overflow" (emu\diimage.h) [smf].
- 0.151              : Added a hack to allow you to limit the number of threads per work queue (all other limits still apply). If you set this to 0 then chdman doesn't hang (osd\windows\winwork.c) [smf].
- 0.150              : Force libflac to never be optimized in a more portable way (lib\lib.mak and libflac\lpc.c). Set GD flag for both "bare" and CHD input (lib\util\cdrom.c) [R. Belmont]. Removed accidental change in 0.149u1 (INT32 g_finds = 0;) (tools\chdman.c) [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.149u1            : Added regtests\chdman\input\createcd_cue_audio_silence_wav_20_tracks_cdfl\in.cue, in.params, silence.wav, createcd_cue_audio_silence_wav_20_tracks_cdlz\in.cue, in.params, silence.wav, createcd_cue_audio_silence_wav_20_tracks_cdzl\in.cue, in.params, silence.wav, output\createcd_cue_audio_silence_wav_20_tracks_cdfl\out.chd, createcd_cue_audio_silence_wav_20_tracks_cdlz\out.chd and createcd_cue_audio_silence_wav_20_tracks_cdzl\out.chd, createhd_raw_empty_flac\in.params, createhd_raw_empty_huff\in.params, createhd_raw_empty_lzma\in.params, createhd_raw_empty_zlib\in.params, output\createhd_raw_empty\out.chd, createhd_raw_empty_flac\out.chd, createhd_raw_empty_huff\out.chd, createhd_raw_empty_lzma\out.chd, createhd_raw_empty_zlib\out.chd, input\createld_avi_yuv2_3_frames_no_audio\in.avi, output\createld_avi_yuv2_3_frames_no_audio\out.chd, input\createld_avi_uyvy_3_frames_no_audio\in.avi, output\createld_avi_uyvy_3_frames_no_audio\out.chd, chdman\input\copy_hd_1\in.chd and output\copy_hd_1\out.chd. Removed unused src\lib\libflac\include\flac++ - libflac++ was removed a long time ago and never used (lib\libflac\include\flac++\all.h, decoder.h, encoder.h, export.h and metadata.h). Added in.params support to all tests (chdman\chdtest.py). chdman -c would only overwrite the amount of compressions defined - part of the default compressions might still have been used. Added unit tests for the CD-based compressions. Added support for .raw input for createhd (chdman\chdtest.py). Added unit tests for createhd with .raw input and tests for each HD compression. Some cleanup and added support for createld (chdman\chdtest.py). Added SHA1 check of output file (chdman\chdtest.py). Treesize in laserdisc CHD was uninitialized when input video had no audio channels (lib\util\avhuff.c). Added createld unit test. Fixed chdtest.py check for output folder existence, clear temp folder before running tests, log which test failed, added extraction for createcd tests cases and added remaining extractions. Fixed yuy16_compress_to_yuy() sometimes writing all green video with YUV2 and UYVY (lib\util\aviio.c). Adjusted logging a bit (chdman\chdtest.py). Only try to clear temp folder when it exists (chdman\chdtest.py). Added copy_hd_1 test case. Small formating change to lib\util\aviio.c. Added workaround to FLAC__lpc_compute_autocorrelation() for 32-bit GCC (aka non-SSE floating point) issues (lib\libflac\libflac\lpc.c). Fixed deletion of output file in case of an error (tools\chdman.c). Fixed hang when chd_file_compressor::async_read() failed (e.g. trying to read an .avi with unsupported color depth) and improved error reporting a bit (lib\util\chd.c and tools\chdman.c). Corrected SHA1 mismatch messages in chdtest.py. Disable creation of uncompressed LD CHDs in chdman.c. Disabled optimizations for FLAC__lpc_compute_autocorrelation() for 32-bit GCC builds to prevent different output filesizes with optimized builds (libflac\lpc.c) [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.149              : Added regtests\chdman\input\copy_cd_cue_audio_silence_wav_20_tracks_v4\in.chd, input\copy_cd_cue_audio_silence_wav_v4\in.chd, input\copy_cd_cue_empty_v4\in.chd, input\copy_cd_nrg_empty_v4\in.chd, input\copy_cd_toc_empty_v4\in.chd, output\copy_cd_cue_audio_silence_wav_20_tracks_v4\out.chd, output\copy_cd_cue_audio_silence_wav_v4\out.chd, output\copy_cd_cue_empty_v4\out.chd, output\copy_cd_nrg_empty_v4\out.chd and output\copy_cd_toc_empty_v4\out.chd.
- 0.148u5            : Various CD-ROM / CHDMAN improvements [R. Belmont]: Corrected import/export of bin/cue images in which the pregap sectors are present. Normalized TOC handling; the start of a track is always the first pregap sector. Finally allows reading and CDDA playing pregap sectors. Works even if the pregap sectors are not present in the file. Note: Existing CHDs should work (or not) as before - previously non-working ones that were broken due to disc geometry should work if regenerated from source. I tested this on several known-touchy cases (including Saturn Black/Matrix Reprint cinemas and PCE-CD Prince of Persia) but there are likely others. Drivers that tried to fake around the previous lack of pregap reading on CDDA may need some adjustment (util\cdrom.c, chdcd.c and tools\chdman.c) [R. Belmont]. Improved portability for older versions of Xcode (libflac\format.c) [John Gilbert].
- 0.148u3            : Simplify the (MESS) psxcd CDROM [Carl]. I haven't found any regressions but I wouldn't be surprised to see some. The only improvements so far is better CD audio and disk change support.
- 0.148u1            : Added src\regtests\chdman\input\copy_cd_cue_audio_silence_wav_20_tracks_v4\in.chd, input\copy_cd_cue_audio_silence_wav_v4\in.chd, input\copy_cd_cue_empty_v4\in.chd, input\copy_cd_nrg_empty_v4\in.chd, input\copy_cd_toc_empty_v4\in.chd, output\copy_cd_cue_audio_silence_wav_20_tracks_v4\out.chd, output\copy_cd_cue_audio_silence_wav_v4\out.chd, output\copy_cd_cue_empty_v4\out.chd, output\copy_cd_nrg_empty_v4\out.chd and output\copy_cd_toc_empty_v4\out.chd. Added "copy" support to chdtest.py / added some v4 to v5 copy tests. Fixed undefined behavior in bitstream_out::write() as well - thanks to -fcatch-undefined-behavior and Clang (lib\util\bitstream.h) [Oliver Stöneberg]. Disabled pointless (at least in terms of MAME/MESS) DEBUG message in libflac (src\lib\libflac\libflac\lpc.c) [Wilbert Pol]. Fixed bad frames occurring on 2GB RIFF splits (lib\util\aviio.c) [Phil Bennett].
- 0.148              : Added src\regtests\chdman\chdtest.py, input\createcd_cue_audio_silence_wav\in.cue, input\createcd_cue_audio_silence_wav\silence.wav, input\createcd_cue_audio_silence_wav_20_tracks, input\createcd_cue_audio_silence_wav_20_tracks\in.cue, input\createcd_cue_audio_silence_wav_20_tracks\silence.wav, input\createcd_cue_empty\in.bin, input\createcd_cue_empty\in.cue, input\createcd_iso_empty\in.iso, input\createcd_nrg_empty\in.nrg, input\createcd_toc_empty\data.bin, input\createcd_toc_empty\in.toc, input\createhd_1\in.params, output\createcd_cue_audio_silence_wav\out.chd, output\createcd_cue_audio_silence_wav_20_tracks, output\createcd_cue_audio_silence_wav_20_tracks\out.chd, output\createcd_cue_empty\out.chd, output\createcd_iso_empty\out.chd, output\createcd_nrg_empty\out.chd, output\createcd_toc_empty\out.chd and output\createhd_1\out.chd. Removed unused m_props from chd_lzma_decompressor (lib\util\chdcodec.c). Fixed result of bitstream_in::peek(0) (lib\util\bitstream.h). Fixed uninitialized memory in the last hunk on CHD creation (fixes potentially different filesize with each compiler not defaulting memory to 0x00 including Visual Studio). Fixed tests target for non-Windows platforms (makefile). Ignore hidden Unix folders. Fixed subprocess.Popen() parameter (fixes execution on non-Windows platfors) (chdman\chdtest.py). Corrected remaining runProcess() calls. Added "createhd" support to chdtest.py via in.params input file. Added new chdman test. Removed overwrite of ARCH when compiling libflac (src\lib\lib.mak) [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.147u4            : Added ISO support to CHDMAN and as mountable image device (util\chdcd.c). Added ISO to supported CDROM images lists (imagedev\chd_cd.c). Give error in cases when track size is not one of supported (util\chdcd.c). Fixed CDROM extensions in listmedia (imagedev\chd_cd.c) [Miodrag Milanovic]. Added .cdr as a synonym for .iso, as seen on e.g. archive.org [Justin Kerk].
- 0.147u3            : FLAC encoder did not use FIR Linear prediction [William Coolay].
- 0.147u2            : Verify softlist items that are not CHDs or roms and display warnings/errors (emu\diimage.c) [Miodrag Milanovic]. Made cdrom_image_device & harddisk_image_device responsible for accessing driver based CHD's [smf].
- 0.147u1            : Fix for "file note writeable" when creating, plus consolidated some duplicate/redundant code (lib\util\chd.c) [smf]. Removed some expressions which are always true (util\cdrom.c) [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.147              : Support for writing to compressed hard drives using diff files (MESS: imagedev\harddriv.c and lib\util\chd.c) [smf]. Removed astring::stringbuffer() / use cached value in astring::len() instead of strlen() (lib\util\chd.c) [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.146u4            : Enable support building the bundled 7z library with a C++ compiler [Markus Rathgeb]. Marked pnchmna, hypbbc2p, jingystm and jojobar1 CHDs as BAD_DUMP (missing Metadata) [R. Belmont, Firewave, Roman]. Fixed memory leak in chd_file_compressor::hashmap [Oliver Stöneberg].
-  2nd July      2012: R. Belmont - Due to a series of bugs, CHDs created with CHDMAN versions prior to the one in 0.146u2 could differ between different OSs (XP vs Vista vs Win7 vs Linux vs Mac OS X), different service pack patchlevels, and even different PCs with the same software load. In almost all cases the SHA1s would match and the data and metadata should be safe, but if you attempted to join a torrent your files would not match. Additionally, there was a possibility of corrupt CD and GD-ROM CHDs being created. For these reasons, you should re-convert all of your CHDs from the "old" v4 versions using the newest CHDMAN. Note that ClrMAMEPro and chdman -verify are unable to detect if your CHDs are problematic in this way, do not use them to determine if you may have the problems. Thanks to MAMEWorld user jmak for debugging these problems.
- 0.146u2            : CHD fixes [jmak]: Fixed uninitialized variables that were creeping into output. Changed qsort() callback to never return "equal", working around unstable system libc implementations (util/chd.c and cdrom.c).
- 0.146u1            : CHD error handling (lib\util\aviio.c and chdcodec.c) [Firewave]. Fixed CHD decompression and memory leak in libflac/libflac/md5.c (fixes memory issues with chdman) [Oliver Stöneberg]. Fixed error from manually merging patch (lib\lib7z\CpuArch.c) [R. Belmont].
- 0.146              : Fix for output of TOC and GDI content on extractcd option [Miodrag Milanovic]. Changed error message to be more descriptive to actual error that occurs when a .dif file version doesn't match the CHD version. Hopefully, this will all but stop the seemingly never ending questions about the error (util/chd.c) [Tafoid].
- 0.145u8            : Various libflac and lib7z fixes [Firewave and R. Belmont]. Fixed error in decompression for avhuff (Laser disc chds don't verify after upgrading to CHD v5). Converted cubeqst CHDs now pass verification [Aaron Giles].
- 0.145u5            : Fixed upgrade to CHD v5 changes SHA1 [Aaron Giles].
- 0.145u4            : Fixed stack overflow in chdman when compiled with Visual Studio by moving objects based on chd_file_compressor to the heap [Firewave]. Cleanup recent changes, fixed a missing case where a compressor was still stack allocated [Aaron Giles]. Correct processing of GDI files, add ability to extractcd to .gdi, verified perfect checksum round-tripping on .GDI files. Fixed big-endian compile [R. Belmont]. Rework libflac to play nicer with MAME's build system (based on suggestions by Tsuruchiyo Nitro); should fix compile problems on certain configrations [R. Belmont]. Removed libflac++, there's no intention of using the C++ interface, so it's just dead code [Aaron Giles]. Changed CHD region tag to something more appropriate [Tafoid]. When copying CHDs, preserve the flag that indicates whether the metadata is included in the SHA1. When creating LD CHDs, don't use a checksum on the AVLD metadata, like we did before. Fixes recompression of laserdisc CHDs. Fixed copy/paste error in the chd.h header which caused the flags passed to be ignored when writing metadata [Aaron Giles].
- 0.145u3            : CHDMAN properly handle and warn on bin/cue output of images with subcode data [R. Belmont].
- 0.145u2            : Removed some calls in image.c, note that add_dynamic_device is still used, it's still handy. Fixed empty CHD creation for HDD's [Miodrag Milanovic]. Better fix is to just not parse start/end when there's no input file. Added new function dumpmeta to dump out a particular piece of metadata to a file or stdout. Re-did the non-CD FLAC codec to be "smart" in that it can choose either big-endian or little-endian on the fly and uses the best one. Added FLAC as a default codec for hard disks, which helps a lot for certain disks [Aaron Giles].
- 0.145u1            : Major CHD/chdman update [Aaron Giles]. The CHD version number has been increased from 4 to 5. This means any diff CHDs will no longer work. If you absolutely need to keep the data for any existing ones you have, find both the diff CHD and the original CHD for the game in question and upgrade using these commands: rename diff\game.dif diff\game-old.dif and chdman copy -i diff\game-old.dif -ip roms\game.chd -o diff\game.dif -op roms\game.chd -c none . Specifics regarding this change: Defined a new CHD version 5. New features/behaviors of this version: Support for up to 4 codecs; each block can use 1 of the 4. New LZMA codec, which tends to do better than zlib overall. New FLAC codec, primarily used for CDs (but can be applied anywhere). Upgraded AVHuff codec now uses FLAC for encoding audio. New Huffman codec, used to catch more nearly-uncompressable blocks. Compressed CHDs now use a compressed map for significant savings. CHDs now are aware of a "unit" size; each hunk holds 1 or more units (in general units map to sectors for hard disks/CDs). Diff'ing against a parent now diffs at the unit level, greatly improving compression. Rewrote and modernized chd.c. CHD versions prior to 3 are unsupported, and version 3/4 CHDs are only supported for reading. Creating a new CHD now leaves the file open. Added methods to read and write at the unit and byte level, removing the need to handle this manually. Added metadata access methods that pass astrings and dynamic_buffers to simplify the interfaces. A companion class chd_compressor now implements full multithreaded compression, analyzing and compressing multiple hunks independently in parallel. Split the codec implementations out into a separate file chdcodec.* . Updated harddisk.c and cdrom.c to rely on the caching/byte-level read/ write capabilities of the chd_file class. cdrom.c (and chdman) now also pad CDs to 4-frame boundaries instead of hunk boundaries, ensuring that the same SHA1 hashes are produced regardless of the hunk size. Rewrote chdman.exe entirely, switching from positional parameters to proper options. Use "chdman help" to get a list of commands, and "chdman help <command>" to get help for any particular command. Many redundant commands were removed now that additional flexibility is available. Some basic mappings: Old: chdman -createblankhd <out.chd> <cyls> <heads> <secs> to New: chdman createhd -o <out.chd> -chs <cyls>,<heads>,<secs> . Old: chdman -createuncomphd <in.raw> <out.chd> ... to New: chdman createhd -i <in.raw> -o <out.chd> -c none ... Old: chdman -verifyfix <in.chd> to New: chdman verify -i <in.chd> -f. Old: chdman -merge <parent.chd> <diff.chd> <out.chd> to New: chdman copy -i <diff.chd> -ip <parent.chd> -o <out.chd>. Old: chdman -diff <parent.chd> <compare.chd> <diff.chd> to New: chdman copy -i <compare.chd> -o <diff.chd> -op <parent.chd>. Old: chdman -update <in.chd> <out.chd> to New: chdman copy -i <in.chd> -o <out.chd>. Added new core file coretmpl.h to hold core template classes. For now just one class, dynamic_array<> is defined, which acts like an array of a given object but which can be appended to and/or resized. Also defines dynamic_buffer as dynamic_array<UINT8> for holding an arbitrary buffer of bytes. Expect to see these used a lot. Added new core helper hashing.c/h which defines classes for each of the common hashing methods and creator classes to wrap the computation of these hashes. A future work item is to reimplement the core emulator hashing code using these. Split bit buffer helpers out into C++ classes and into their own public header in bitstream.h. Updated huffman.c/h to C++, and changed the interface to make it more flexible to use in nonstandard ways. Also added huffman compression of the static tree for slightly better compression rates. Created flac.c/h as simplified C++ wrappers around the FLAC interface. A future work item is to convert the samples sound device to a modern device and leverage this for reading FLAC files. Renamed avcomp.* to avhuff.*, updated to C++, and added support for FLAC as the audio encoding mechanism. The old huffman audio is still supported for decode only. Added a variant of core_fload that loads to a dynamic_buffer. Tweaked winwork.c a bit to not limit the maximum number of processors unless the work queue was created with the WORK_QUEUE_FLAG_HIGH_FREQ option. Further adjustments here are likely going to be necessary. Fixed bug in aviio.c which caused errors when reading some AVI files. Move all-0 detection to the write path. Use hunk_info on the compression path to detect whether the write went through (util/chd.c + tools/ldresample.c). Fixed blocksize for FLAC encoder. Update CHD error list in chd.c. Remove 100% redundant and silly list of error strings in harddriv.c and chd_cd.c.
- 0.145              : David Haywood fixed error where FLAC was encoding 4 times too much data (samples vs. bytes).
- 0.144u7            : Fixed disk loading so that it handles full region tags (emu\romload.c) [Aaron Giles]. Fixes laserdisc and hard disk based games falling over. Added FLAC (lossless audio) codec support plus experimental hooks in samples and chdman. Bumped up CHD-CD hunk size to get better compression ratios on both zlib and flac [David Haywood, R. Belmont]. Changed the way FLAC compiles so that it works like other external libraries, and also compiles successfully for MSVC builds [Aaron Giles].
- 0.144u5            : R. Belmont fixed CHDMAN -extractcd of images with postgaps. CHDs do not need reconversion, this was an -extractcd problem only. Don't be case sensitive on the input type extension.
- 0.143u4            : Miodrag Milanovic supported full/relative paths when creating CD ROM image (chdman.c), also added support for GDI with files containing space char. Added support for loading other image types to CDROM device, with use of chdman part of code.
- 0.142u6            : R. Belmont fixed CHDMAN GCC 4.6 build.
- 0.142u3            : Handle track type 6 in .nrg files in chdman [R. Belmont]. R. Belmont fixed uninitialized variables found by Valgrind (diimage.c).
- 0.141u3            : Experimental incomplete .nrg disc image import (CHDMAN) [R. Belmont].
- 0.141u1            : Added imagedev\harddriv.c/h. Miodrag Milanovic added CHD support in softlists.
- 0.139u3            : R. Belmont rewroted CHDMAN bin/cue support from specs (more images now work), improved -extractcd bin/cue output, improved error handling and support for .WAV tracks in bin/cue images. Angelo Salese added a set volume function for CD-DA.
- 0.139u1            : Fixed image device error handling [ShimaPong, Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.138u4            : Sandro Ronco and Miodrag Milanovic fixed image unload and creation (src\emu\diimage.c).
- 0.135u2            : CDiFan fixed audio output lengths in aviio.c.
- 0.135              : R. Belmont added chdman option to create uncompressed writeable HD images for MESS.
- 0.133u1            : Michael Zapf fixed chdman -update to leave the write protect state alone when updating uncompressed CHDs.
- 0.131              : The CHD format has undergone a change with this release. The main reason for this change is to include some of the key metadata into the hashes for the CHDs. This ensures that the metadata is valid and prevents abuse. The first impact you will find is that all of your CHD differencing files are invalid. Just delete your "diff" directory contents entirely. The second impact is that all your existing CHDs will warn you that they have incorrect hashes. This is expected. Your old CHDs should still work fine, so if you can live with the "bad ROM" warnings, you don't really need to do anything. However, if this bugs you or you want to be "clean", you can update your CHDs, using this command line: chdman -update <chdfile> <newchdfile> for each one of your CHDs. This will take a while, but will produce CHDs that match the new checksums posted in the drivers.
- 0.130u3            : Build the IDE features table only when there is a CHD available [Curt Coder].
- 0.130u1            : IMPORTANT NOTE: The CHD format has undergone a change with this release. The main reason for this change is to include some of the key metadata into the hashes for the CHDs. This ensures that the metadata is valid and prevents abuse. The first impact you will find is that all of your CHD differencing files are invalid. Just delete your "diff" directory contents entirely. The second impact is that all your existing CHDs will warn you that they have incorrect hashes. This is expected. Your old CHDs should still work fine, so if you can live with the "bad ROM" warnings, you don't really need to do anything. However, if this bugs you or you want to be "clean", you can update your CHDs, using this command line: chdman -update <chdfile> <newchdfile> for each one of your CHDs. This will take a while, but will produce CHDs that match the new checksums posted in the drivers. Aaron Giles updated CHD format to version 4. Checksums are now computed and stored separately for raw data and metadata, and metadata is now checksummed by default. Aaron Giles updated chdman to support a generic metadata addition system: chdman -addmetatext <chdfile> <tag> [<index>] <sourcefile> and chdman -addmetabin <chdfile> <tag> [<index>] <sourcefile>. Aaron Giles changed the CHD verify interfaces to pass back a structure containing all the necessary data for verification and fixing. Aaron Giles modified cdrom.c to expose metadata read/write functions, and changed chdman to use them. Also changed chdman to parse old-style metadata and convert it to new-style metadata. Aaron Giles added new function core_fload() to load a file into an allocated buffer. Updated src2html, regrep and chdman tools to use this function where appropriate. Updated CHD hashes [Yasuhiro Ogawa, Aaron Giles, David Haywood]. Aaron Giles fixed bug where chdman -extract would not truncate to the logical size. NOTE: The CHD format has undergone a change with this release. The main reason for this change is to include some of the key metadata into the hashes for the CHDs.

- 0.130              : Allow CHDs to be directly in the rom directory without a subdirectory [Olivier Galibert].
- 0.129u6            : Aaron Giles added flags to the CHD metadata entries, encoded in the top bit. Right now it is a no-op, but eventually will be used to indicate which bits of metadata are included in the overall checksum.
- 0.127u1            : Aaron Giles fixed corrupt CHDs are reported as missing.
- 0.127              : ElSemi included support for parsing .gdi files in CHDMAN.
- 0.126u4            : Aaron Giles removed per-frame metadata support from chdman. Creating an A/V now simply requires an AVI file input. Aaron Giles fixed bug in winwork that caused the creation of single work items to return NULL, and thus lead to massive memory leaks when using A/V CHDs. Disks opened by the romload module are no longer identified by index. Instead, they are identified by the region they were loaded in. This generally means one disk per region. get_disk_handle() now takes a region name in place of an index. Updated all callers to do this. The SCSI modules in particular posed a challenge to make this work, so watch out for potential bugs there [Aaron Giles]. Aaron Giles added new option to chdman, where if you use -createav with a special filename (either 2:2 or 3:2) it will create a fake laserdisc files with the equivalent cadence. This can be used for testing until full captures are available. Most games used 2:2 apart from Dragon's Lair and Space Ace, which were 3:2. Note that even though these files are essentially blank, they are Huffman-compressed, meaning that the maximum compression ratio you will get is 8:1, so they still end up ~5GB. Aaron Giles moved error strings from chdman.c to chd.c, where they can be fetched from any caller via the new chd_error_string() function. Fixed bug in aviio.c which could cause an infinite loop if attempting to read sound beyond the end of the file.
- 0.123u6            : Aaron Giles fixed CHDMAN -extract to a physical drive on Windows.
- 0.118u6            : smf fixed regression that caused CHD games to crash if the CHD was not present. Also fixed change that required write access to CHDs. Aaron Giles fixed CHD search paths again so that they look in parent subdirectories. smf added SCSIOP_GET_INQUIRY_BUFFER to scsicd & scsihd.
- 0.118u5            : Nathan Woods removed CHD interface structure. CHDs now rely on the corefile routines to perform file I/O. Updated the rest of the system to handle this reality. A side-effect is that "split" CHDs, which never got much play, have now been deprecated.
- 0.118u4            : CHDMAN improvements [smf]: Fixed toc parsing to allow spaces and quotes in file names. Supports "offset start length" track syntax that cdrdao creates if you don't read subcode. Tracks are always padded with zeros & not whatever data happens to follow. Moved cdrom_track_input_info out of src\lib\util\cdrom.h and into src\tools\chdcd.h. Added audio byte swapping support.
- 0.118u2            : smf improved fixes to the chdman CD creating code.
- 0.118u1            : smf fixed chdman_open() "w" to always create/truncate the file, leaving "r+" to try opening first and then truncating. This matches behavior in the core.
- 0.117u1            : Roman Scherzer fixed crash in CHD code if reading beyond the end of the file.
- 0.116u4            : smf added support to CHDMAN to cope with toc files created with cue2toc.
- 0.112u2            : Added src\lib\util\aviio.c/h, avcomp.c/h and huffman.c/h. Aaron Giles added several new modules to the utility library libutil. First is a generic huffman encoding module. Second is a module that allows you to read/write AVI files in a platform-independent way. And third is a lossless A/V compression module. These three pieces together, plus some changes in the CHD code, allow for the creation of CHDs with compressed audio and video. Added two new commands to chdman: -createav converts an AVI file in uncompressed YUY format or HuffYUV-compressed YUY format with "left" prediction into a CHD. And -extractav converts a CHD containing compressed audio & video into an uncompressed YUY format AVI file.
- 0.111u6            : Moved src\chdman.c to src\tools\.
- 0.111u5            : Aaron Giles changed behavior in CHDMAN so that a 0 sector size means the default.
- 0.111u4            : Aaron Giles simplified the hard disk interfaces a bit. Added support in chd.c for lossy compressors, computing CRCs and other hashes based on the decompressed output in those cases. Also added support for asynchronous reads/writes using the new osd work item interfaces.
- 0.111u3            : Aaron Giles cleaned up chdman, normalizing its behavior and improving error reporting.
- 0.110u4            : Rewrote the Dragon's Lair driver from the schematics. Added new module machine\laserdsc.c which has laserdisc emulation for the PR-7280 and LD-V1000 laserdisc players. Full emulation of the laserdisc is pending support for CHD audio/video and high quality rips, but you can operate the game and see the frame numbers that would be displayed. Added built-in layout to display the scores, lives and credit information [Aaron Giles].
- 0.110u3            : Aaron Giles enhanced chd.c to support hunk sizes up to 16MB, versus the previous 64k limit. Added hooks to chd.c to specify codec-specific configuration info. Added support for split CHD files. CHD files can be transparently split into multiple pieces and left that way during read access. Modifications to split files are always written to the last file. A new command chdman -split is now available to split an existing CHD file.
- 0.110u2            : Significant cleanup of chd.c [Aaron Giles]: Got rid of the horrible last_error concept; now all routines return an error directly. Fixed several issues in managing metadata. Changed compression and verification routines to be client-driven rather than monolithic. Changed internal codec usage to be more flexible. Altered chdman and MAME to use the new interfaces. Added new -createraw command for creating raw data CHDs.
- 0.109u5            : smf updated CHD locating behavior to accept CHDs referenced by the parent of a clone if the hash matches, even if it has a different name.
- 0.104u3            : Chris Hardy fixed CHDMAN to write the correct number of logical bytes when extracting something that is not an even number of hunks large.
- 26th January   2006: R. Belmont - As most people understand by now, the ZiNc arcade emulator runs games based on varients of the original 1995 Sony PlayStation hardware. For a variety of reasons (one being just to see what happened), I've done some initial work towards having it also emulate the base home console itself. The 3 major points of difference are the CD-ROM drive's type (custom Sony vs. IDE or SCSI in the arcade boards that used CDs), the memory cards, and the joypads. I hooked up a CD-ROM capability by loading and calling out to an ePSXe-compatible CD plugin and almost immediately started getting some cool things to happen. Here's a few: Silent Hill: Boot warning Title, Wipeout XL: Title In-game, Tekken: Galaga (loading)In-game, Crash Bandicoot: Title, Time Crisis: Title In-game and Madden NFL '97: Main menu In-game. Please note that the final fate and design of this feature are not yet decided, so if you're definitely interested in shaking things up a little in PSX emulation (it's been kinda dead for a while, hasn't it?), voice your support on the official ZiNc forum at bannister.org.
- 0.103u4            : Aaron Giles moved CHD file access routines to fileio.c.
- 0.103u3            : Lawrence Gold added support for >4GB CHD files to CHDMAN for non-Windows systems.
- 0.103              : Lawrence Gold fixed CHDMAN to support 64-bit file sizes on some *nix platforms.
- 24th March     2005: Aaron Giles - Can I use chdman to put a CHD file back onto a hard disk? Yes you can, at least under Windows. You have to be logged in as administrator, and you have to know which physical volume your target hard disk is mapped as. The easiest way to do that on Windows XP and later is to right click on My Computer and select Manage from the menu. In the Computer Management window, in the tree on the lefthand side, select Disk Management. That will show you a list of all the physical hard disks you have plugged in. They will be listed as "Disk 0", "Disk 1", etc. Make a note of which disk number your target hard disk is. Once you've done that, it's easy to "image" the CHD file onto the disk. Just use the following syntax: chdman -extract imagename.chd \\.\PHYSICALDRIVEn - where "imagename.chd" is the name of the CHD file, and the "n" next to PHYSICALDRIVE is the disk number you figured out above. This technique has been used by several people to restore dead hard drives on arcade games. Note that you can also use chdman to create a backup of a hard disk image in much the same way: chdman -createhd \\.\PHYSICALDRIVEn imagename.chd. Which is how most of the CHD images have been created.
- 0.88               : Rene Single fixed a cut and paste error in CHDMAN.
- 0.86u3             : CHDMAN update [R. Belmont]. This makes the parser deal with .toc files output by current cdrdao better. I need to just give in and rewrite it for 2-pass operation sometime, it'll be much cleaner then. Incidentally, if anyone has any idea where to get specs for e.g. CloneCD or some other popularish image format(s) let me know and I'll add support. Converted some CD images to CHD.
- 0.81u7             : smf fixed a couple of issues with hard disks without checksums.
- 0.80u3             : R. Belmont added Preliminary CD-ROM support for CHDMAN. CDROM emulation primitives, including Red Book audio playback and support for the AM53cf96 SCSI controller. The SCSI CD-ROM emulation needs to be separated out from the AM53cf96 if we ever emulate other SCSI controllers or CD-ROM drives. Audio tracks on CDs are not compressed on a CD image at present (or more accurately they're gzip compressed, which is useless). The plan is to use FLAC at some point.
- 0.80               : Nathan Woods added some completion messages, and fixed the code that was falsely assuming that progress() was a function pointer in chdman.c.
- 0.79u3             : Nathan Woods added -createblankhd and -copydata commands and new arguments to -createhd to src\chdman.c. Ported it to Macintosh.
- 23rd February  2004: Nathan Woods added a few new commands to chdman and ported it to Macs.
- 0.78u5             : Olivier Galibert removed some 'smart' code from CHD filename handling.
- 0.78u1             : Nathan Woods added workaround for deficiency in Metrowerks compiler (src\chd.c).
- 21st December  2003: R. Belmont - Added CD-ROM support to the CHD format and CHDMAN utility. (For the curious, CDRDAO rips are used as input, and CDRWIN bin/cue could be added easily).
- 0.77u3             : Nathan Woods added #ifndef <headername>_H protection to src\harddisk.h and src\chd.h.
- 0.77u2             : Removed src\hdcomp.c. CHDman updates, with added checks to make sure source chd's aren't corrupt when doing updates etc [Aaron Giles].
- 30th November  2003: Aaron Giles sent in another update to chdman, making it verify the files when doing an update, merge or a diff operation.
- 25th November  2003: smf fixed some slight bugs in chdman that prevented it from compiling under DOS.
- 0.77u1             : Added src\chdman.c and src\chd.c/h. New CHD format and management tools [Aaron Giles]: hdcomp is now chdman old CHD files are _not_ compatible, they will need to be updated using chdman -update oldchd.chd newchd.chd. CHD now stands for 'Compressed Hunks of Data' not 'Compressed Hard Drive' as the format is more flexible.
- 21st November  2003: Aaron Giles - Well, I think the new CHD format seems to be working okay. It turns out that the hard drives for the Seattle games are often copied onto much larger hard drives, so finding one on the "factory original" hard drive is a bit tricky. It also means that if you compress the hard drive, it will often have garbage data on the end that makes the resulting CHD much larger than it should be. For example, the Mace hard disk I have is a 3.2GB hard disk, but most of the data on there is garbage and irrelevant to the game. I've been looking into ways of reliably "chomping" away the garbage. My current experiments have Mace down to a svelte 130MB, down from 1.2GB.
- 18th November  2003: Aaron Giles fixed various problems in the new CHD code.
- 17th November  2003: Aaron Giles sent in the first update to the CHD format support, separating the file format and hard disk functionality and adding support for SHA1 checksums in the format.
- 16th November  2003: Aaron Giles - We have a new CHD format. The next version of MAME will require you to update your CHDs. Now don't worry, you can do it yourself using the chdman utility (formerly known as hdcomp). Why the need for an updated format? Well, the existing format was close but not quite general enough to do everything we wanted to support other things like CD images and whatnot, so I re-engineered the CHD format to be usage-neutral. In fact, the code that actually implements the format doesn't know anything about hard disks, sectors, cylinders, etc. I also beefed up the compression a bit so you can get SmallCHD-like sizes in an officially supported manner. There are a also a bunch of other small tweaks & features in the updated format that make it overall a pretty nice improvement.
- 14th November  2003: Aaron Giles started rewriting the compressed hard disk code to better support different formats.
- 29th October   2003: Aaron Giles added a function for making desired read/write accesses take extra time.
- 0.76u1             : Reversed harddisk.c back to 0.73 status.
- 0.75               : Nathan Woods moved some variable declarations out of for loops so that it can compile in non-GCC compilers (src\harddisk.c).
-  6th October   2003: Roman Scherzer fixed a small crash bug in the harddisk writing functions.
- 26th September 2003: Bryan Aldrich submitted an improvement to the compressed hard drive image functions to avoid storing duplicate blocks in the .chd file when creating it, making the file a little smaller if there was redundancy.
- 18th August    2003: Roman Scherzer submitted a small bug fix to the hdcomp program.
- 0.72u1             : Nathan Woods added a function to retrieve the harddisk interface.
- 0.71u1             : Stefan Jokisch fixed MAME not looking in parent directory for Hard Drive images.
- 0.70u1             : Nathan Woods enhanced the hard disk code to support sector sizes other than 512 bytes (a non-IDE harddisk in MESS for one of the TI systems uses this). src\machine\idectrl.c has been modified to take this into account; it requires that HD images be 512 bytes. The new code is fully backwards compatible with old CHDs that do not have a sector size within them.
- 31st March     2003: Brad Oliver fixed several minor bugs that affected big-endian systems.
-  1st January   2003: Aaron Giles and Paul Priest fixed a bug in the hard disk image MD5 computation that affected Killer Instinct and Killer Instinct 2.
-  8th December  2002: Aaron Giles implemented compressed hard disk extraction and merging in the hdcomp tool, added support for various things in the IDE controller emulation.
- 30th November  2002: Aaron Giles fixed a crash that sometimes occurred when creating a new hard disk difference file.
- 20th November  2002: Aaron Giles improved the MD5 verification fix.
- 18th November  2002: Aaron Giles sent in an alternate fix for the false-positive MD5 checksums and improved the hdcomp tool.
- 13th November  2002: Aaron Giles prevented hard disk images being stored in ZIP files, and cleaned up various things in the source.
- 31st October   2002: smf added HD image support to the DOS version.
- 0.59               : Added src\harddisk.c/h, hdcomp.c and md5.c/h. Support for compressed hard disk images [Aaron Giles].
-  8th March     2002: Aaron Giles added hard disk support and emulation for a standard IDE controller.

I12.6   CD-ROM

- 0.189              : Added cdrom_get_chd (Get a handle to a CHD from a cdrom; util\cdrom.cpp) [MetalliC].
- 0.185              : Translate from 2336 to 2048 (Return 2048 bytes of Mode 1 data from a Mode 2 form or XA sector) [Carl].
- 0.177              : Removed create_option_guide() as you can't create CD's (imagedev\chd_cd.cpp) [smf].
- 0.176              : Fixed >2GB .iso parsing in util\chdcd.cpp. Set pregap subcode type to NONE for .CUE and .TOC for consistency with other formats [MetalliC].
- 0.173              : Declared (std::nothrow) some allocations (util\cdrom.cpp) [dankan1890].
- 0.169              : When chdman wants only the original sectors from CHD-CD, give it only the original sectors (util\cdrom.cpp) [R. Belmont].
- 0.154              : Fixed usage of uninitialized member in cdda_device [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.152              : smf fixed (MESS) [debug] crash during Playstation Logo (machine\psxcd.c).
- 0.148u5            : Various CD-ROM / CHDMAN improvements [R. Belmont]: Corrected import/export of bin/cue images in which the pregap sectors are present. Normalized TOC handling; the start of a track is always the first pregap sector. Finally allows reading and CDDA playing pregap sectors. Works even if the pregap sectors are not present in the file. Note: Existing CHDs should work (or not) as before - previously non-working ones that were broken due to disc geometry should work if regenerated from source. I tested this on several known-touchy cases (including Saturn Black/Matrix Reprint cinemas and PCE-CD Prince of Persia) but there are likely others. Drivers that tried to fake around the previous lack of pregap reading on CDDA may need some adjustment (util\cdrom.c, chdcd.c and tools\chdman.c).
- 0.148u3            : (MESS) Small cleanups (machine\psxcd.c/h). Added CDDA muting to machine\psxcd.c [Carl]. Stop PSX crashing when reloading a state when CD access was in progress. Stop PSX CD timers when reset [smf].
- 0.148u2            : Fixed uninitialized member in mess\machine\psxcd.c [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.148u1            : Fixed compile on a define switch (machine\psxcd.c) [Angelo Salese]. Cache CPU & SPU lookup (machine\psxcd.c) [smf]. (MESS) Properly close the old image when swapping CHD-CDs (imagedev\chd_cd.c) [Steve Leung].
- 0.148              : Introduces CD-ROM concept of logical sector addresses so games see the disc with pregap/postgap sectors actually taking up sector numbers as in reality. Fixes PC-Engine CDs with hardcoded sector numbers [R. Belmont, Angelo Salese]. Read ISO as binary as well (lib\util\chdcd.c). Cleaned up some chdcd.c error messages (lib\util\chdcd.c). Added a "tests" target to the makefile (chdtest.py). First version of chdman unit test. Fixed dependies of tests target. Recreated all files for the chdman unittest. Added test for TOC input. Fixed filename set in NRG track parsing. Added NRG test to chdman unit test (lib\util\chdcd.c). Fixed reading of NRG images. Bail out on unsupported tracks in NRG images / cleanups (lib\util\chdcd.c). Improved error reporting of parse_wav_sample() and fixed potential resource leaks / use more proper errorcodes when encountering an error when parsing an input file (lib\util\chdcd.c). Corrected comment and log message in parse_wav_sample() about channels. Corrected some format specifiers (lib\util\chdcd.c) [Oliver Stöneberg]. Skip without reading of Nero CD (lib\util\chdcd.c) [smf]. Fixed CD-ROM getting the type of the last track, fixes PCE Bomberman '94 proto [R. Belmont]. Added cdda_get_channel_volume() function to CD-DA device. Fixed volume control display in PC Engine CD system [Angelo Salese].
- 0.147u4            : Added ISO support to CHDMAN and as mountable image device (util\chdcd.c). Added ISO to supported CDROM images lists (imagedev\chd_cd.c). Give error in cases when track size is not one of supported (util\chdcd.c). Fixed CDROM extensions in listmedia (imagedev\chd_cd.c) [Miodrag Milanovic]. Added .cdr as a synonym for .iso, as seen on e.g. archive.org [Justin Kerk].
- 0.146u2            : CHD fixes [jmak]: Fixed uninitialized variables that were creeping into output. Changed qsort() callback to never return "equal", working around unstable system libc implementations (util/chd.c and cdrom.c).
- 0.145u8            : Marked all remaining old-style CDs without gap information BAD_DUMP. These will still run (where applicable), but need to be re-ripped for best accuracy (and proper audio track timing for some Bemani games) [R. Belmont, Firewave].
- 0.145u6            : David Haywood added code to cdrom.c to compute and verify ECC codes for mode 1/2 sectors. Aaron Giles added CD compressor template which separates subcode data from sector data, removes redundant ECC data prior to compression, and uses separate compressors for each part. Defined LZMA and ZLib CD compressors based on this and made them the default for CDs. Sadly couldn't wrap the FLAC compressor here because it would have produced incompatible output with previous versions.
- 0.145u2            : R. Belmont fixed crash when parsing bin/cue (util\chdcd.c). The right fix is to not compare against array index -1 [Aaron Giles].
- 0.143              : R. Belmont converted CDROM mode 1 Form 1 sectors to mode 1 raw if requested.
- 0.141u3            : Added alt lba_to_msf conversion needed by SegaCD/MegaCD (cdrom.h) [David Haywood].
- 0.141u1            : Added emu\imagedev\chd_cd.c/h.
- 0.139u4            : Barry Rodewald added a per-channel volume setting function to sound/cdda.
- 0.138u4            : Miodrag Milanovic added per-device image softlist loading routine. Added ability to support other types of software lists, so floppies, cassettes, cd-roms are now possible to be used.
- 0.138u2            : chdman/cdrom updates [R. Belmont]: CDRWIN .bin/.cue images now supported for both input and output. Pregap and postgap information is now preserved in the format. Output of CDRDAO images is significantly improved. Existing CHD-CDs will continue to work fine and for data-only discs no action needs to be taken. For mixed data/audio discs (e.g. analog 573/Bemani games) they should be re-converted for better preservation.
- 0.138              : Oliver Stoeneberg fixed stack corruption in CHD code (lib\util\cdrom.c).
- 0.137u4            : R. Belmont corrected CDROM header length for form 2 raw sectors.
- 0.128u2            : R. Belmont fixed wrong sector size at CD_TRACK_MODE2 conversion routine.
- 0.124u1            : Various SCSI devices register state items by their disk ID, which are not unique across device types. Introduced a device-type offset for CD-ROMs so their registrations don't clash with harddisks [R. Belmont].
- 0.118u6            : smf added SCSIOP_GET_INQUIRY_BUFFER to scsicd & scsihd.
- 0.118u1            : smf fixed converting CD's containing audio that were ripped by cdrdao, which was broken recently. The code is cleaner and more maintainable now.
- 0.116u4            : R. Belmont added stricter checking in cdrom.c to prevent crashes in games when no CD-ROM is present.
- 0.114u2            : R. Belmont updated stvcd to be working enough that most Saturn games at least die for some other reason, and a few actually do useful things. Also included a small update to the core CDROM code so you can fetch a sector without knowing in advance what format it is.
- 0.112u3            : smf added state saving to emu\sound\cdda.c.
- 0.111u6            : Moved src\chdcd.c/h to src\tools\.
- 0.111u1            : Nathan Woods moved a chunk of platform specific code out of chdcd.c and romcmp.c into the osd_tool code.
- 0.110u3            : Aaron Giles cleaned up cdrom.c. Removed audio implementation and relocated code into sound\cdda.c. Changed metadata format to be textual instead of binary (old metadata format is still supported). Removed external access to CHD positions; all accesses are now done at the physical LBA level and converted internally.
- 0.106u1            : Improvements to CHD-CD support [R. Belmont]: Additional RAW CD sector conversion support, so a game can request e.g. 2048-byte data sectors from a RAW CHD-CD and still get the right data. Reversed CHDMAN error message - now non-RAW CHD-CDs are deprecated. Susume now uses a RAW CHD-CD read directly from an original pressed Konami disc.
- 18th March     2006: Guru - CDROM - GE984 A01(BM) arrived late yesterday from Japan.
- 0.103              : R. Belmont added cdrom_get_track_length() to cdrom.c. Completely rewrote machine\stvcd.c and .h. There's a lot less there now, but what's there is more understandable and works much better.
- 0.95               : Added machine\scsicd.c. R. Belmont moved actual CD-ROM and harddisk device emulation out of am53cf96.c to new scsicd.c and scsihd.c files. CD-ROM emulation expanded to support more SCSI commands and bugfix some existing ones. Added -extractcd to convert CHD-CDs back into CDRDAO .bin/.toc images.
- 0.89u1             : R. Belmont fixed small problem in CHDCD.
-  5th April     2004: R. Belmont improved the CHD-CD support slightly, to support other track formats better.
- 0.81               : CHDMan CHDCD creation fix [R. Belmont].
- 0.80u3             : Added src\cdrom.c/h, chdcd.c/h and sound\cdda.c/h. R. Belmont added Preliminary CD-ROM support for CHDMAN. Input is from CDRDAO .toc/.bin  images (cdrdao.sourceforge.net). CDRDAO comes with utilities to convert CDRWIN .cue/.bin images to .toc/.bin format. CDROM emulation primitives, including Red Book audio playback and support for the AM53cf96 SCSI controller. The SCSI CD-ROM emulation needs to be separated out from the AM53cf96 if we ever emulate other SCSI controllers or CD-ROM drives. CHDMAN doesn't output anything useful when you extract a CHD-CD. It should write out a CDRDAO image.
- 15th January   2004: R. Belmont - CD audio tracks now work for CHD-CDs, so Susume! Taisen Puzzle-Dama has background music.
-  2nd January   2004: R. Belmont - Ongoing work on CHD-CD support to make it submittable.
- 21st December  2003: R. Belmont - Added CD-ROM support to the CHD format and CHDMAN utility. (For the curious, CDRDAO rips are used as input, and CDRWIN bin/cue could be added easily).
- 0.77               : Support for preliminary CD driver for the STV game Sports Fishing 2 (machine\stvcd.c).
- NOTES: If the CD in the Konami-GV System is swapped to another GV game, the game will boot but will stop with an error '25C MBAD' (the EEPROM is 25C). So the games can not be swapped by simply exchanging CDs because the EEPROM will not re-init itself if the CDROM is swapped. This appears to be some form of mild protection to stop operators swapping CD's. The CD contains one MODE 1 data track and several Redbook audio tracks which are streamed to the speaker. The CD for the Konami GV System contains one MODE 1 data track and several Redbook audio tracks which are streamed to the speaker via CN8. For the Capcom CPS-3 games the dumper used CDRWIN V.3.4C to copy the CD. CD labels: CAP-WZD-5 (Capcom 1996 - Warzard), CAP-JJK-140 (Capcom 1998 - JoJo's Venture), 703EAA02 (Konami 1998 - Heatof11)

- 0.146u5            : Updated forgotten LD games (drivers\deco_ld.c, dwarfd.c, esh.c, lgp.c, segald.c, superdq.c and timetrv.c). Fixed SCREEN_UPDATE_RGB32 and added MCFG_LASERDISC_OVERLAY_CLIP to deco_ld.c. Removed legacy 8255 APIs [Angelo Salese]. Fixed building ldplayer [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.146              : Fixed ldplayer compile [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.145u2            : Aaron Giles fixed ld tool compilation (tools/ldresample.c).
- 0.145              : Added ldplayer\ldplayer_dev.lst. First pass of cleaning up LDPLAYER to allow for building [Tafoid].
- 0.144u6            : Removed machine\ldcore.c/h. Added machine\laserdsc.c, ldpr8210.h, ldstub.c/h, ldv1000.h and ldvp931.h. Major bitmap-related changes throughout the system [Aaron Giles]. Reorganized the laserdisc base driver and all the laserdisc drivers as modern C++ devices, cleaning the code up considerably. Merged ldsound device into the laserdsc device since modern devices are flexible enough to handle it.
- 0.140              : Aaron Giles fixed LDPLAYER fails to link.
- 0.136u2            : Fixed Laser Disc build fails with missing OPTION_ROMPATH.
- 0.136u1            : Aaron Giles fixed UNIDASM fails to link when ldplayer is the specified target.
- 0.132u5            : Aaron Giles added mechanism for the laserdisc core to return 0 for the Philips codes if video is squelched. Updated the Gottlieb and Cliff Hanger drivers to request it this way, since they decode externally.
- 0.131u3            : Aaron Giles tweaked some of the laserdisc interfaces to use ROM_NAME() and MACHINE_DRIVER_NAME() macros.
- 0.130u4            : Derrick Renaud fixed analog settings to return to default when IPT_UI_SELECT (enter) pressed. Fixed misplaced brackets, allowing upper/lower case extensions for crosshair graphics and LDplayer CHD files.
- 0.130u1            : Vas Crabb fixed build of ldplayer on OS X. Since the CUSTOM sound module no longer exists, I arbitrarily changed it to WAVE, as ar gets upset if it has no input files. I also removed the -all_load flag for ldplayer from the main makefile as it upsets the linker on OS X.
- 0.129              : Laserdisc player works again. Added MDRV_LASERDISC_GET_DISC callback hook which allows for dynamically finding the CHD, rather than relying on the DRIVER_INIT hackery that was there before [Aaron Giles]. Oliver Stoeneberg cleaned up some memory and file handles in the error cases of ldverify. Aaron Giles fixed linking ldplayer fails and wrong colors using Direct3D on ATI cards.
- 0.128u7            : Aaron Giles modified laserdisc players to walk back to their global device state via the owner, rather than brute-force searching for the first instance and hoping that is the right one.
- 0.128              : Added tools\ldresample.c. Aaron Giles added new tool ldresample to assist in resynchronizing audio tracks in a CHD with frames. Currently still WIP but useful if you know what you're doing.
- 0.127u7            : Aaron Giles added new functions for building device-relative tags. Changed machine configuration builder to use these functions. Also changed the laserdisc player devices to use them. Updated Z80 CTC/SIO code to assume that the CPU provided for the clock is relative to the device that the CTC/SIO belong to. Updated memory code to assume that regions and devices referenced by the memory map are relative to the device the associated CPU belongs to. Aaron Giles cleaned up and normalized the three existing laserdisc emulations. Removed obsolete code from the laserdisc core.
- 0.127u6            : Aaron Giles removed render_container_set_palette_alpha() hack. Now the alpha value can be set directly in the palette entry and will be respected for laserdisc overlays. ldverify improvements [Aaron Giles]: Uses back-end decoding for CHDs directly to bitmaps. Changed min/max detection to only check 0/255. Fixed off-by-one bug in min/max computation. Separated white code detection from frame number detection. Track cadence with frame numbers as well as white codes. Use vbiparse.h constants where appropriate. Aaron Giles simplified core deinterlacing logic based on availability of pre-decoded VBI data. Added plumbing for allowing for overall brightness/contrast/gamma corrections on laserdisc video. Fixed bug when combining brightness values in the palette logic.
- 0.127u5            : Removed machine\laserdsc.c. Aaron Giles added Philips 22VP931 laserdisc emulation, which is mostly working. Communication works fine and basic searching/playback/skipping is functional. Still a bit glitchy.
- 0.127u4            : Aaron Giles changed requirements for laserdisc CHDs to require a new chunk of metadata with pre-decoded frame information. Modified chdman to automatically produce this for CHDs that are of the appropriate parameters. To fix up existing CHDs, use chdman -fixavdata on the CHD. Aaron Giles modified the laserdisc core to leverage the pre-decoded frame metadata, which is now required. This improves seek times when searching and allows the player-specific emulation access to the VBI data as soon as it would really be available. Changed update callback timing to fire just before the first line of VBI data would be read; at that point, the frame selection is assumed to be committed. Aaron Giles changed laserdisc video parameters to position the screen area at the bottom rather than the top, since this corresponds more closely to standard line numbering. Aaron Giles extended the vbiparse code to support pack/unpack, and to more fully document all the meanings of the VBI codes. Aaron Giles updated ldplayer to support slow/fast forward movement, frame/chapter display and separate controls for scanning/stepping. Aaron Giles converted Simutrek-hacked laserdisc emulation to using the actual MCU from the game, which in turn hands off commands to the PR-8210 MCU. This is still not 100% but is pretty close at this point and achieves the correct behaviors in most cases.
- 0.127u3            : Aaron Giles extended the LD core interface structure to allow each player type to provide its own ROM region and partial machine driver. Aaron Giles changed laserdisc interface to explicitly specify the screen and sound devices it should route to. Drivers no longer have to manually call laserdisc_vsync(). Instead, the laserdisc code connects up to the routed screen device and works based on that screen's VBLANK timing. Removed all existing calls to laserdisc_vsync(). Aaron Giles changed laserdisc behavior so that it completes the previous video read and initiates the next read at the end of VBLANK instead of the beginning. This gives player logic time during VBLANK to alter the slider position prior to fetching the next frame. Aaron Giles added new laserdisc callback for vsync begin and changed the update callback to be called at the end of VBLANK. Also added functions to set the slider speed, advance the slider, and directly control the video/audio squelch. In addition, there is a new status function to get the slider position in general terms.
- 0.127u2            : Added machine\ldcore.c/h and ldv1000.c. Aaron Giles split core laserdisc functionality into separate file ldcore.c. Each player now gets its own source file, along with new hooks which enable more precise control over the behavior. Updated the PR-8210 and LD-V1000 implementations to the new spec. Other players will come online shortly. Aaron Giles changed laserdisc scan behavior so that it requires a constant stream of signals to continue scanning. Updated ldplayer accordingly.
- 28th August    2008: Aaron Giles - About Laserdiscs, part 3: As I mentioned previously, laserdiscs directly encode and reproduce the broadcast signal format (either NTSC or PAL). So in order to understand how the information about frame numbers and other details are encoded, it is important to know the basics of the underlying signal format. In this case, I'll talk about NTSC specifically. An NTSC frame consists of 525 scanlines of data, broadcast 29.97 times per second. As I mentioned before, each frame consists of two fields, which makes each field 262.5 scanlines (yes, it is true that there is an extra half-scanline). Of these 262.5 scanlines, only 240 are normally visible. This is because your classic CRT-based TV set required some time to move the electron beam from the bottom-right of the screen back to the upper-left in preparation for the next field, and 22.5 scanlines' worth of time was decreed to be an appropriate timeframe for this to happen. These extra 22.5 scanlines each field are known as the Vertical Blanking Interval, or VBI. Traditionally, there is not much of interest transmitted within the VBI area of the field, apart from a few basic control signals that were used for calibrating the picture and synchronizing the timing. Over time, however, people came up with reasons to add useful data to the VBI area. One of the most well-known of these is Closed Captioning, which is encoded on line 21 of each field (the top 22 lines are the VBI, and the following 240 are the visible lines). Laserdiscs took this a step further, and defined special encodings of their own. Line 11 of each field contains what is known as the "white flag", which is a simple binary indicator of whether the current field is the first field of a frame. Laserdisc players look for this white flag to know how to do a still frame that doesn't consist of a split between two film frames. Since it takes two fields to make one frame, and since many film-based laserdiscs are encoded in a 3:2 cadence, it is not straightforward to ensure this without some additional information. Even more interesting than the white flag are the "Philips codes" that are encoded on lines 16, 17, and 18 (note that all the laserdisc encodings are on lines different from Closed Captioning, so that laserdiscs could be encoded with Closed Captioning data as well). The Philips codes are special 24-bit digital values that are encoded in the VBI area of each field, and which are used to describe the field. In general, there are up to two Philips codes encoded on three lines, with line 17 generally being a redundant copy of line 18 for added resilience against dropouts or other transmission errors. So how do you encode a 24-bit binary number into a single scanline of an analog video signal? The answer is to use an encoding technique known as Manchester codes. If you treat bright white as a '1' bit, and black as a '0' bit, then this encoding uses two bits to encode each bit of the code. The reason for two bits is to ensure that the decoded value makes sense, and also to establish a clock for the codes. This works because Manchester codes encode a '0' bit as 10 and a '1' bit as 01. Because of this, you are guaranteed that in the middle of each bit there is a transition from black to white or vice-versa, and this can be used to establish the clock. Once you figure out the clock, then the direction of each transition tells you what the actual value of the bit is. Below is a picture of the VBI region for a CAV laserdisc. The top few rows are an ugly green because those lines of VBI data were not provided by the capture card. Once the Philips codes are extracted, they can be treated as binary data and evaluated. Unfortunately, it seems as though most of the information about what the various Philips codes mean has been kept relatively secret. However, the most important codes are understood: $88FFFF = Lead-in code (indicates the field is located before the official start of the disc), $80EEEE = Lead-out code (indicates the field is located after the official end of the disc), $FXXXXX = Frame code (specifies the 5-digit frame number (XXXXX) in BCD format), $8XXDDD = Chapter code (specifies the 2-digit chapter number (XX) in BCD format) and $82CFFF = Stop code (indicates the player should pause at the current field). So as the player reads data from the disc, it also needs to detect the white flag and Philips codes, and act on them as necessary. By capturing the VBI data along with the normal active video, we are able to preserve this information, and write a laserdisc simulator that operates off of the same information that the original players did.
- 0.127              : Aaron Giles added new generic laserdisc VIDEO_UPDATE handler to the laserdisc code. This handler works for both disc-only games and those with overlays. For disc-only games, the base macro is sufficient. For games with overlays, an additional set of configuration macros are provided: MDRV_LASERDISC_OVERLAY - specifies update function, width, height and bitmap format of the overlay, MDRV_LASERDISC_OVERLAY_CLIP - specifies the visible area of the overlay bitmap, MDRV_LASERDISC_OVERLAY_POSITION - specifies default x,y position and MDRV_LASERDISC_OVERLAY_SCALE - specifies default x,y scale factors. The update function provided to MDRV_LASERDISC_OVERLAY is identical to a normal VIDEO_UPDATE callback, so a standard one can be used. All existing laserdisc drivers have been updated to support this new rendering mechanism, removing much duplicated code. Aaron Giles added new macros MDRV_LASERDISC_SCREEN_ADD_NTSC and _PAL, which defines a standard screen with the correct video timing characteristics and update function for laserdiscs. Updated all drivers to use these macros instead of defining their own screens. Aaron Giles added DISK_REGIONS to all laserdisc drivers. Aaron Giles added DISK_IMAGE_READONLY_OPTIONAL to support games (like Cube Quest) where the disk is non-essential to the game's operation. Aaron Giles fixed bug in identifying the custom sound driver for the laserdisc. Aaron Giles updated ldverify to identify blank regions of the disc for post-processing. Aaron Giles fixed rendering 16bpp with alpha using bilinear filters (fixes screenshots of laserdisc games with overlays).
- 0.126u5            : Added ldplayer\ldplayer.c, ldpdriv.c and ldplayer.mak. Aaron Giles added new target ldplayer, which is based on MAME but serves as a standalone laserdisc player for CHDs. Right now only the Pioneer LD-V1000 is connected, and limited commands are available. Each player type is a driver, so you specify the player type on the command-line. The driver then opens the first CHD it finds in your ROM path and uses that as the laserdisc. The intention is that you specify the -rompath each time on the command-line, so a typical approach might be: ldplayer ldv1000 -rompath j:\mach3 , where it will pick up the mach3.chd lurking in your j:\mach3 folder. Several basic commands are supported: Space = play/pause, Alt = toggle frame display, Left = scan forward (when playing) or step forward (when paused), Right = scan backward (when playing) or step backward (when paused), 0-9 = enter numbers for search and Enter = execute search to frame. Aaron Giles rejiggered huffman.c to support multiple interleaving streams and a delta-RLE pre-encoding. Added optimized case for the Y/Cb/Y/Cr video encoding case. Cleaned up the code. Aaron Giles updated avcomp.c to use the new huffman.c functions. Reworked configuration options to allow for both input and output of naturally aligned data streams. Updated chdman and laserdsc to use the new interfaces. New compression gives an additional 3-7% over previous attempt and compresses the dummy CHDs down significantly. Aaron Giles added video level detection and reporting to ldverify. Aaron Giles forced a sound synchronization on each vsync in the laserdisc playback. This prevents overwriting the tail end of the buffer which was fouling up the MACH 3 audio decoding.
- 12th August    2008: Aaron Giles - About Laserdiscs, part 2: All known laserdisc-based videogames use CAV (constant angular velocity) laserdiscs, primarily because these discs could be manipulated in advantageous ways. Players of the era could seek to specific frames, play at different speeds, still frame, play backwards, and perform all sorts of other operations that were not possible with CLV discs. The reason this was possible is that on a CAV disc, each track corresponds exactly to one frame of video. There are approximately 54,000 tracks on one side of a CAV laserdisc, giving 54,000 frames of video per side. Now, believe it or not, laserdiscs are actually analog devices, meaning that the signal that is stored on them is analog, and is described exactly by the video transmission data standard of its intended country (NTSC or PAL, depending on where you live). Thus, once the data is read from the laserdisc, it is basically identical to the signal that you would receive over the airwaves for watching regular broadcast TV. Let's step back a moment and think about how laserdiscs of movies work. A movie is traditionally filmed at 24 frames per second. In contrast, the NTSC broadcast standard (which describes how video is transmitted in North America) describes the TV signal as running at 30 frames per second. Furthermore, each frame is built up of two "fields", which are drawn one after another at a slight offset. This is known as interlacing. Since there are two fields each frame, and the frames run at 30 per second, the result is that the individual fields are transmitted at twice that rate, or 60 times per second (in reality, it is 29.97 frames/second and 59.94 fields/second, but we'll stick to round numbers). So the question becomes, how do you reproduce a film, running at 24fps, within the NTSC standard, which runs at 30fps (or more precisely, 60 fields/second)? If you transferred one frame of film to one frame (two fields) of NTSC video, the result would play back at 30fps, or 25% too quickly. If you duplicated each film frame onto two frames (four fields) of NTSC video, the result would play back at 15fps, or 38% too slowly. The solution that engineers came up with many years ago was to realize that 60 / 24 = 2.5. That is, when you look at it in terms of fields instead of frames, each film frame should conver exactly 2.5 fields of NTSC video. However, since you can't split the video midway within a field, they chose instead to alternate between using 3 fields per film frame and 2 fields per film frame. So the first film frame will be duplicated onto the first 3 fields, while the second film frame will be duplicated onto the next 2 fields, and so on. This is known as 3:2 cadence. The important thing to realize out of all of this is that there was not always a 1:1 relationship between film frames and NTSC frames (though there often was, for example, when the laserdiscs contained video that was originally produced for broadcast TV). That is, if you wanted to view frame #1000 of the actual film, you could not necessarily just seek to NTSC frame #1000 and end up where you wanted. Instead you actually had to go figure out which NTSC frame corresponded to film frame #1000. When the laserdisc was designed, this discrepancy was actually taken into account. The designers realized that being able to seek to a given NTSC frame was actually not nearly as useful as being able to seek to a particular film frame, and so they devised a way to encode information about the frame numbers on the laserdisc itself. Which brings us back around to games. For years, laserdisc emulation has relied on "frame files" and "conversion equations" to determine how to map the film frames (which is what all the seek commands target) to NTSC frames (which is what you get when you capture video). But the information about which NTSC frame corresponds to which film frame was present all along in the video signal itself; we were just not aware of it, nor aware of how to capture it. In the next article, I'll talk about how this information is encoded.
-  7th August    2008: Aaron Giles - About Laserdiscs, part 1: Laserdiscs come in two varieties: CAV (constant angular velocity) and CLV (constant linear velocity). As its initials imply, a CAV laserdisc spins at the same speed no matter where on the disc it is being read from. Since laserdiscs play back at a fixed data rate, this implies that data is packed more tightly near the center of the disc than it is toward the outer edges. If you remember your basic geometry, the circumference of a circle is directly proportional to the radius (C = K x r). Let's say the disc spins just fast enough so that one rotation holds one video frame. So if you encode one frames' worth of data at r=5, you have to pack it into a linear distance of 5K. If you encode the same amount of data at r=8, you have much more room (8K) to store it in. In contrast, a CLV laserdisc packs its data at the same density regardless of its location on this disc. This means that in order to read it, a laserdisc player must adjust the rotation speed depending on how far away from the center of the disc it is reading. Compact discs are CLV devices and you probably recognize the disc speed changing as you seek back and forth. Back to the geometry, in CLV discs data is read at a constant rate (R) per unit of circumference (rate = R x C). Since the circumference is proportional to the radius, this makes the data rate proportional to the radius as well (rate = R x (K x r) = RK x r). This means that at r=5, the disc stores 5RK units of data, and at r=8, the disc stores 8RK units of data. It's pretty clear that CLV discs pack the data more efficiently than CAV discs. This is because with CLV discs, you can pack the data at the maximum rate the player is capable of reading consistently across the entire disc. Whereas with CAV discs, the data can be efficiently packed at the inner part of the disc, but as you move farther away from the center, it gets increasingly less densly packed. In reality, CAV discs maxed out at about 30 minutes (54,000 frames) of playback per side, while CLV discs generally got about 60 minutes per side. Given these facts, why on earth would you ever create a CAV disc, when a CLV disc allows you to pack the data more efficiently? Well, because the simplicity of finding information on a CAV disc enabled many special features: still frames, reverse play, slow motion, and - most importantly for laserdisc-based video games - direct access to any frame on the disc by index. With a CAV disc, each video frame happens to corresponds to one rotation of the disc. Thus, if you want to advance 100 frames ahead, you simply moved the laser up the appropriate amount and read the data there. On the other hand, with a CLV disc, advancing 100 frames involves knowing how fast the data is coming and computing where to seek and how much to adjust the rotation speed to find the target, a much more complicated maneuver. When it comes to movies, most laserdiscs were produced as CLV, to minimize the number of times you need to flip or change discs. A few special edition and high-end versions of movies were released as CAV, enabling access to nice still frames and other effects. When it comes to videogames, however, it's all CAV. In the next article, I'll ignore CLV discs entirely, and talk about tracks, frames and VBI data on CAV discs.
- 0.126u4            : Added tools\ldverify.c. Removed tools\makemeta.c. Aaron Giles added proper laserdisc support for MACH 3, Us vs. Them and Cobra Commander (MACH 3 hardware). Old laserdisc hacks are now removed. The code now talks to the standard Pioneer PR-8210 interface. Also removed hacky "target list" from the MACH 3 ROMs; this information is now decoded on the fly from the right channel laserdisc audio. Aaron Giles changed laserdisc support to parse white flags and other data from the VBI data directly, rather than relying on the textual metadata. Expanded video frame cache to 3. Changed the way frames are assembled to decrease the likelihood of getting an interlaced weave. Fixed sound creation so that it is done at reset time instead of device start, when the sound devices aren't yet live. Change the laserdisc interface to no longer require a disk number or a custom sound device. Both are now assumed to be tagged the same as the laserdisc device. Updated all drivers accordingly. Other laserdisc changes [Aaron Giles]: Changed PR-8210 interface to work consistently for both Gottlieb and Stern games. Added audio callback mechanism to allow drivers to peek at the raw audio streams. Aaron Giles removed obsolete makemeta tool. Replaced it with new ldverify tool which walks through either an AVI or CHD capture from a laserdisc and ensures that there are no anomalies lurking in the VBI data. Aaron Giles added new option to chdman, where if you use -createav with a special filename (either 2:2 or 3:2) it will create a fake laserdisc files with the equivalent cadence. This can be used for testing until full captures are available. Most games used 2:2 apart from Dragon's Lair and Space Ace, which were 3:2. Note that even though these files are essentially blank, they are Huffman-compressed, meaning that the maximum compression ratio you will get is 8:1, so they still end up ~5GB. Aaron Giles updated vbiparse to improve Manchester code decoding. It now assigns a confidence level per bit based on how solid the data is. Also added a new function vbi_parse_all which parses the white flag and all three lines of metadata from a laserdisc frame. It then compares line 17 and 18 against each other and selects the most likely candidate based on per-bit confidence and other factors. Aaron Giles added frame number display to laserdsc.c. It is off by default, though most players can be configured to turn it on (not sure if any actually do). It can be manually toggled via the backslash key during playback.
- 0.126u2            : Laserdiscs are now devices. Updated all drivers accordingly [Aaron Giles].
- 0.126u1            : Added util\vbiparse.c/h. makemeta changes [Aaron Giles]: Split out Manchester code parsing into a separate utility module. Rewrote Manchester code parsing to be clock based. Updated tools\makemeta.c to call the new functions. Changed makemeta to parse a different format for metadata. Fixed Huffyuv decompression in aviio. Added more robust logic to parse out the white flag.
- 13th July      2008: Aaron Giles - DirectShow Part 2: A while back, when the initial push to start adding laserdisc support to MAME was happening, I discovered that there was something missing in all existing laserdisc captures. If you know anything about the NTSC broadcast standard, you know that a video signal consists of 525 scanlines spread across a 30Hz (actually 29.97Hz) interval. Of those 525 scanlines, 480 are considered to be "visible" scanlines, while the remaining 45 constitute the vertical blanking interval (VBI). At first, the VBI part of the scan just contained a couple of special signals for synchronization, but over time, people started adding data to them. The most famous example is closed captioning, which is usually encoded as binary data on line 21 of each video field (a single 30Hz frame is sent as two 60Hz fields, interlaced). Getting back to DirectShow, the way this is handled for video capturing is that the video capture component has a VBI output, which is the raw VBI data, usually sampled at a high rate (2x or 3x the video sampling rate) for improved accuracy. As with everything in DirectShow, there are filters that you can attech the VBI output to, which will decode the line 21 data into binary data, and then further filters that will render the captions as overlays on top of the video stream. The thing I discovered about laserdiscs, though, is that they encoded several very important bits of metadata on some of the VBI lines. Specifically, line 12 has what is known as a "white flag", line 16 contains some control bits, and lines 17-18 contain information about the current frame number and chapter. Even more importantly, all of this metadata is crucial to the way laserdiscs are controlled and operated in video games. The problem is, how do you capture that data? Well, you could route the raw VBI data to a file and then attempt to sync it up with your video capture. But an easier way to deal with it would be to simply take the VBI data, reconstitute it as video signal, and render it above the visible video signal, to essentially reproduce a capture of the entire video signal - all 525 lines of it. Sadly, such a filter didn't exist (or at least I was unable to find such a thing). But thankfully, the DirectShow architecture makes it a fairly simple matter to write your own, which turned into a little side project that I have been working on. Although not quite ready for prime time (synchronization is still a little tricky), the basic filter is now up and running, and we have some actual demo captures with the laserdisc VBI data intact: (In the current version, I extract the laserdisc metadata and overlay it on the video as well, to see if the information matches up. The frame number that the laserdisc player decoded is in large text at the top, and the information my filter has decoded is displayed on the bottom, with field 1 info on the left and field 2 info on the right). In the end, I'll post the source and binary versions of this filter so that it will be possible to get consistent laserdisc captures complete with metadata (on Windows only, though similar techniques can probably be applied to other platforms). And yes, with this problem solved, they should be starting to happen in the coming months.
- 12th July      2008: Aaron Giles - DirectShow: Had my first real exposure to DirectShow recently and I've come away pretty impressed. For those who don't know, DirectShow is an architecture inside Windows that is used for streaming and capturing media (audio/video). It works through a series of independent components, each of which has some number of inputs and outputs. These components can then be assembled as appropriate to route data through the system. (Note that I believe there is a successor to DirectShow, but since I'm an old-skool kind of person and wanted compatibility with other DirectShow components, I went that way). Components fall into three categories: sources, which only have outputs and provide source data; renderers, which only have inputs and "render" the final data; and filters, which have both inputs and outputs and transform the data in some way. Now, this might not seem all that impressive until you realize that the process of connecting components and building up a data flow has been completely abstracted. The key to this is the Microsoft-provided utility GraphEdit. What this simple utility does it allow you to add a bunch of filters and then interconnect them. You then hit "play" and the filters are activated. Assuming you have assembled the filters and connections between them properly, data flows from the source through the filters and to the renderer(s). As a super-simple example, you can take a still image (say, a JPG file) and make that your "source" via the Generate Still Video component. You can then route the output of that to a Color Space Converter filter which applys color transformations to the image. And then you can route the output of the filter to the "Video Renderer", which renders any video inputs to the screen in a window. Once you've built this graph, you simply hit "play" and up pops a window with the JPG image. Ok, that was super-simple, but you start to get the idea. The next step is to try changing the renderer to something else. Let's say we want to output an AVI file of this still image. We can do that by first connecting the output of the Generate Still Video source to one of the inputs of an AVI Mux filter (this filter accepts multiple inputs - usually a video stream and an audio stream - and interleaves them into a single AVI data stream). We then connect the output of the AVI Mux filter to a "File Writer" renderer, which lets us route the raw output of any filter to a file. Now when we hit "play", the still video source is converted to an AVI file. Let's say we want to both view the output AND generate an AVI file. No problem. We insert a new Smart Tee filter, which has one input and two outputs, each of which contains a copy of the input. Then we wire one output through the Color Space Converter and out to the Video Renderer to see what we are viewing, and we wire the second output through the AVI Mux and out to the File Writer. Hitting "play" now does both: an image and an AVI file. Now for the main event. Let's swap out the source with something more interesting. Say, the video capture component provided by your video capture card (each card is different, so I can't provide the exact details here, but you need to dig through all the filters to find them). Usually there are two pieces: a Crossbar source component, and a Capture filter component. Set up the Crossbar to output the appropriate source from your capture device, route that through the Capture component, and then route the outputs from there into the Smart Tee, which is still outputting to the screen and an AVI file. Hit "play" and now with nothing more than this GraphEdit tool, you have a video capture solution. Granted, it's a bit bare bones (some components have property panels you can get at via a right-click), but it works. And the ability to wire up the filters comes in handy in a major way.
- 0.112u3            : Added src\tools\makemeta.c. Aaron Giles added new tool makemeta.exe, which can generate properly formatted metadata for laserdisc CHDs using either a specially captured AVI as input (preferred) or a hand-crafted set of encoded Philips codes.
- 0.112u2            : Aaron Giles added several new modules to the utility library libutil. First is a generic huffman encoding module. Second is a module that allows you to read/write AVI files in a platform-independent way. And third is a lossless A/V compression module. These three pieces together, plus some changes in the CHD code, allow for the creation of CHDs with compressed audio and video. Added two new commands to chdman: -createav converts an AVI file in uncompressed YUY format or HuffYUV-compressed YUY format with "left" prediction into a CHD. And -extractav converts a CHD containing compressed audio & video into an uncompressed YUY format AVI file. Finished hooking up laserdisc support to the new audio/video compression. Note that we still do not have canonical CHDs of laserdisc data at the moment, but all the support is now present for when they start to appear.
- 0.111u5            : Aaron Giles added support for the custom Badlands commands to the LD-V1000 emulation.
- 0.111u4            : Ernesto Corvi added support for the Pioneer PR-8210 laserdisc player. Aaron Giles improved behavior of the laserdisc code when seeking so it doesn't get "stuck". Added preliminary support for the 22VP932 laserdisc player.
- 0.111u3            : More updates to the laserdisc emulation, based on more complete understanding of how the discs are encoded and how they will eventually be stored [Aaron Giles].
-  2nd January   2007: Aaron Giles - Some Laserdisc Progress: After a bit of a hiatus with the holidays and fun power outages, I've been back making some progress on the laserdisc support. I now have the basic CHD format spec'ed out and implemented. And I have modified chdman.exe to support two new commands: -createav, which takes an AVI file plus an optional metadata file and compresses them to a CHD; and -extractav, which takes a CHD file and extracts it to an AVI file and a metadata file. (And yes, the AVI reader/writer is cross-platform code, so it will work on non-Windows platforms as well. I also have a mostly complete QuickTime reader/writer, but am not sure if it is worth the effort to complete it. Though plugging the two together would produce an AVI <-> QuickTime conversion program, which would be useful!). I'm happy to say that with a little bit of work using a test capture, I am now actually capable of displaying video from within MAME. There's still a lot of work to do yet to get the rest of the way, but this is a good step forward. Next up will be synchronizing frame and track numbers (you'll note the numerical discrepancy in the screenshot), wiring up the sound, improving performance, further enhancing chdman.exe with some additional I/O options, and all the while working with the great group of folks I've been talking to in order to get great quality source captures. More to come as it all comes together!
- 0.110u5            : Reorganized the laserdisc support a bit to accommodate new players. Added Sony LDP-1450 support.
-  4th December  2006: Aaron Giles - It should be pretty obvious with the update to the Dragon's Lair driver in 0.110u4 that something is brewing on the laserdisc front. There has been a lot of discussion over the years about how to make it happen, what video formats to use, etc, etc. In the end, it seemed that nobody was ever happy enough with the proposed ideas to actually take them and run. But with the discs and equipment getting older and older, and my (relatively) recent success in reading an NFL Football CED (http://www.cedmagic.com/featured/nfl.html) (thanks to Tim's (http://arcadecollecting.com/) help), I figured it was finally time to just pick a direction and move forward. One of the big stumbling blocks is that pretty much all existing video compression algorithms are heavily patented. Which means that for freely developed and freely available software, there isn't really a good way of utilizing standards such as MPEG. Plus, MPEG hardly qualifies as 'archival' quality. For this reason, MAME will be going its own way, but it won't be straying too far from the usual paths. The container format for the data will be CHD (which originally stood for Compressed Hard Drive, but has since been redubbed as Compressed Hunks of Data). Each frame, including audio and video data, will be a fixed length (some frames will have one fewer audio sample due to rounding, but this is easy to compute). The video frame rate, height, width, audio sample rate, and number of channels will be encoded in the CHD metadata. Each frame is independently compressed. Audio data is stored as multiple 16-bit channels at an arbitrary sample rate (we will be shooting for 44.1kHz stereo during sampling). The audio data is compressed losslessly using Huffman-compressed deltas. This gives a nice compromise between storing the data raw and doing something more complex and aggressive like FLAC. Audio data is just a drop in the bucket anyway from a data rate perspective, so why skimp? This compression may also be used in the future for CHD-CD's with audio tracks, and for systems that read/playback tape-based data. Video data compression is still being fine-tuned, and is waiting some good quality source data to experiment with, both animated and filmed. At a minimum, a lossless compression based on Huffman-compressed per-channel (Y,Cb,Cr) deltas will be available. This is essentially what HuffYUV does. I have also written a lossy DCT-based compressor that is tuned for archival purposes rather than bit rate limiting. That is, with an MPEG compressor you specify your data rate, and the compressor quantizes the DCT coefficients to fit the data rate. With our video compression, you specify a maximum error and a maximum average error for each channel, and the compressor tweaks the quantization on each 8x8 block indepedently to ensure that those criteria are met. The source material will be sampled at DVD resolutions (720x486 for NTSC video) in 'uncompressed' form - which is actually slightly compressed in that it is 4:2:2 subsampled, so each Cr and Cb sample covers two pixels horizontally. This is oversampling for laserdisc video, but it's better to have more data than not enough data. This effectively gives you 16 bits per pixel uncompressed, or 720 x 486 x 2 = 699,840 bytes per frame. Add in a frames' worth of audio data (assuming 29.97fps) at 44100Hz gives an extra 5886 bytes, for a total per-frame average of 705,726 bytes (5.4 MBits) per frame. Once you start multiplying that out, it's a lot of data: 20.6 MB/second, 1.18 GB/minute, or 70.9 GB/hour. Most video game laserdiscs are CAV, which maxes out at 54000 frames, or just over 30 minutes. Lossless tends to give you between 2:1 and 3:1 compression. Going up to lossy with medium deltas (up to 4/256 per component) gets you closer to 4:1 and 5:1 compression with almost no visible difference. Increasing the max deltas beyond that helps further with compression, but it definitely starts to become visible. Not everything is nailed down yet, and it will probably take a couple of months to materialize, but those are the basics. The first game I'm looking at is obviously Dragon's Lair, but coincidentally, I just received in the mail a driver for the American Laser Games series (http://www.dragons-lair-project.com/tech/pages/alg.asp) of shooters as well, which were all run on an Amiga 500 with a genlock. Fortunately, the Amiga emulation is pretty decent these days, so things are progressing well there. Now that the basic system is up and running, I'm hoping others can help get the rest of the laser games moving forward. In 0.110u4 I included support for a couple of common laserdisc players. Even though you can't see any video yet, you can at least watch their operation to see if things are working properly. In 0.110u5 I'll have support for the Sony LDP-1450 (http://www.dragons-lair-project.com/tech/ldguide/sony.asp) laserdisc player and the ability to display dummy frames (each frame is solid color and gets a unique Cb/Cr value) so that you get a little better sense of the operation. And hopefully in the next month or so, I'll have the first video running at last...
- 0.110u4            : Added machine\laserdsc.c/h. Rewrote the Dragon's Lair driver from the schematics. Added new module machine\laserdsc.c which has laserdisc emulation for the PR-7280 and LD-V1000 laserdisc players. Full emulation of the laserdisc is pending support for CHD audio/video and high quality rips, but you can operate the game and see the frame numbers that would be displayed. Added built-in layout to display the scores, lives and credit information [Aaron Giles].
-  1st September 2001: Mirko Buffoni added support for the Dragon's Lair video. However, it only works with the DVD-ROM version and only in Windows, so inclusion is unlikely.

I12.71  Pioneer PR-8210

- 0.132u5            : Aaron Giles made PR8210 serial processing a little more robust.
- 0.127u7            : Aaron Giles and Warren Ondras added correct overlay positioning, font and behavior to PR-8210 emulation. Aaron Giles cleaned up and normalized the three existing laserdisc emulations. Removed obsolete code from the laserdisc core.
- 0.127u4            : Aaron Giles converted PR-8210 emulation over to using the actual MCU from the laserdisc player. This MCU controls low-level functions such as slider position and laser on/off, and receives decoded vertical blanking data in order to make decisions. Removed old HLE behavior. Note that the overlay text is displayed via the UI; this is temporary and will be fixed shortly. Aaron Giles converted Simutrek-hacked laserdisc emulation to using the actual MCU from the game, which in turn hands off commands to the PR-8210 MCU. This is still not 100% but is pretty close at this point and achieves the correct behaviors in most cases.
- 0.127u3            : Added ldplayer\layout\pr8210.lay. Aaron Giles moved preliminary PR-8210 emulation code from ldplayer.c to ldpr8210.c. It is currently disabled behind the EMULATE_PR8210_ROM compile time flag. Aaron Giles further updates to the PR-8210 ROM simulation. Still not quite there but the system is much better understood now. Added layout to the PR-8210 which displays the state of the front-panel LEDs. CPUs, sound chips, devices and ROM-regions which are specified by devices now have their tags auto-prefixed with the device's tag. This allows for multiple instances to be present. For example, the PR-8210 laserdisc player has a CPU with a tag of "pr8210". When it is included as a device by a driver, the driver may tag the device "laserdisc". The resulting final CPU tag name will be "laserdisc:pr8210". Also updated the debugger expression engine to support names with embedded colons [Aaron Giles].
- 0.127u2            : Added machine\ldpr8210.c. Aaron Giles split core laserdisc functionality into separate file ldcore.c. Each player now gets its own source file, along with new hooks which enable more precise control over the behavior. Updated the PR-8210 and LD-V1000 implementations to the new spec. Other players will come online shortly. Aaron Giles changed laserdisc scan behavior so that it requires a constant stream of signals to continue scanning. Updated ldplayer accordingly.
- 0.127u1            : Aaron Giles added PR-8210 support to the ldplayer. Fixed step forward command on the PR-8210. Aaron Giles added some initial logic to boot and run the PR-8210 ROM (i8049) in ldplayer.c. Currently this is disabled behind a compile-time switch. Once this is working, the plan is to incorporate this into the existing PR-8210 emulation, but we're not there yet.

I12.72  Pioneer LD-V1000

- 0.175              : Added command strobe callback interface for LDV1000, and hooked it up to esh.cpp driver [Angelo Salese].
- 0.127u7            : Aaron Giles added preliminary LD-V1000 emulation. Not fully working yet, but mostly there. Aaron Giles cleaned up and normalized the three existing laserdisc emulations. Removed obsolete code from the laserdisc core.
- 0.127u6            : LD-V1000 [Aaron Giles]: Added some (compile-time removed) information about the ROM and memory map.
- 0.127u2            : Added machine\ldcore.c/h, ldv1000.c. Aaron Giles split core laserdisc functionality into separate file ldcore.c. Each player now gets its own source file, along with new hooks which enable more precise control over the behavior. Updated the PR-8210 and LD-V1000 implementations to the new spec. Other players will come online shortly. Aaron Giles changed laserdisc scan behavior so that it requires a constant stream of signals to continue scanning. Updated ldplayer accordingly.
- 0.126u5            : Aaron Giles added new target ldplayer, which is based on MAME but serves as a standalone laserdisc player for CHDs. Right now only the Pioneer LD-V1000 is connected, and limited commands are available. Each player type is a driver, so you specify the player type on the command-line. The driver then opens the first CHD it finds in your ROM path and uses that as the laserdisc. The intention is that you specify the -rompath each time on the command-line, so a typical approach might be: ldplayer ldv1000 -rompath j:\mach3 , where it will pick up the mach3.chd lurking in your j:\mach3 folder. Several basic commands are supported: Space = play/pause, Alt   = toggle frame display, Left  = scan forward (when playing) or step forward (when paused), Right = scan backward (when playing) or step backward (when paused), 0-9   = enter numbers for search and Enter = execute search to frame. Aaron Giles rejiggered huffman.c to support multiple interleaving streams and a delta-RLE pre-encoding. Added optimized case for the Y/Cb/Y/Cr video encoding case. Cleaned up the code. Aaron Giles updated avcomp.c to use the new huffman.c functions. Reworked configuration options to allow for both input and output of naturally aligned data streams. Updated chdman and laserdsc to use the new interfaces. New compression gives an additional 3-7% over previous attempt and compresses the dummy CHDs down significantly. Aaron Giles added video level detection and reporting to ldverify. Aaron Giles forced a sound synchronization on each vsync in the laserdisc playback. This prevents overwriting the tail end of the buffer which was fouling up the MACH 3 audio decoding.
- 0.111u5            : Aaron Giles added support for the custom Badlands commands to the LD-V1000 emulation.
- 0.110u4            : Aaron Giles rewroted the Dragon's Lair driver from the schematics. Added new module machine\laserdsc.c which has laserdisc emulation for the PR-7280 and LD-V1000 laserdisc players. Full emulation of the laserdisc is pending support for CHD audio/video and high quality rips, but you can operate the game and see the frame numbers that would be displayed. Added built-in layout to display the scores, lives and credit information.

I12.73  Philips 22VP931
- 0.127u7            : Aaron Giles cleaned up and normalized the three existing laserdisc emulations. Removed obsolete code from the laserdisc core.
- 0.127u5            : Added machine\ldvp931.c. Aaron Giles added Philips 22VP931 laserdisc emulation (Fire Fox), which is mostly working. Communication works fine and basic searching/playback/skipping is functional. Still a bit glitchy. smf removed sprite to tile priority in Fire Fox, it doesn't exist.
- 28th January   2003: smf sent in a preliminary Fire Fox driver written by him and Chris Hardy, but the laserdisc emulation has not been done yet so there's not much to see.

12.8   GDROM

- 0.155              : Typo fix (switch (command[2] & 0x0f)) [O. Galibert].
- 0.151              : Fixed comment and logerror for command 0x12 (it's normally INQUIRY, not REQUEST SENSE but for GDROM it's used to set data that is returned by command 0x11) (machine\gdrom.c). Use virtual multiple inheritance to share command processing between SCSI & ATAPI instead of having a SCSI subdevice. This allows matsushita_cr589_device & gdrom_device to derive from atapi_cdrom_device (machine\gdrom.c) [smf].
- 0.150              : Preliminary SET FEATURES support. Only set transfer mode is currently supported, but this checks/sets flags in the identify device buffer.

Slot options can now be configured inline without creating an array. Legacy support for old configuration uses MCFG_FRAGMENT_ADD, which required changing so the current device could be updated by the fragment. Converted cassette, pccard1 & pccard2 slots to use new MCFG macros (drivers\ksys573.c). Uses device_mconfig_additions() to added ATA slots, which allows you to just add the device and configure it rather than using the MCFG_ATA_INTERFACE_ADD #define. MCFG_MODIFY_DEVICE(DEVICE_SELF) is no longer required in machine configs used in a slot option. Removed MCFG_DEVICE_CONFIG_CLEAR as it's legacy but not used anymore. Removed support for static config from slots (emu\dislot.c and mconfig.c) and converted the two devices using it (MESS: at.c + bebox.c) to machine config fragments [smf].
- 0.149              : Moved default card config, device inputs and clock off the slot interface so they can be specified for all cards (emu\dislot.c/h, imagedev\floppy.h, machine\ctronics.h, idectrl.h, nscsi_bus.h, machine\pci.h, emu\mconfig.c, drivers\jaguar.c and rastersp.c). Added support for machine config fragments that are applied when the cart is loaded, converted NCR 53C7xx to DEVCB2 as an example [smf].
- 0.148u2            : Fixed compile (emu\dislot.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.146u1            : Expanded slot definition with clock and config so we can better define fixed slot devices where needed. Fixed for slot menus. And some cleanup [Miodrag Milanovic].

Moved software checks in front of other checks in clifront in order to make things more consistent with behaving when cmd line parameters are sent, also added emuopts support to add newly created options if some is added with adding software item in slot [Miodrag Milanovic]. Added possibility to see subslot devices when they are added from softlist, also removed "const" from get_default_card_software, that enable better usage and no need for it to be like that [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.145              : Proper fix for issues with slots, removed old fix too [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.144u6            : Cartslot is now C++ device [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.143u3            : Nathan Woods fixed initialization order for slot devices.
- 0.143              : Miodrag Milanovic added support for multi level slot devices.
- 0.142u3            : Support for dynamic devices added to the core [Miodrag Milanovic]: Added slot and slot card interfaces (emu\dislot.c/h). Added SLOT_INTERFACE macros in order to simplify device adding. Added new menu option "Slot Devices" and support to change device in runtime. Updated emuopts to support command setting of slot cards. Updated clifront and added listslots option to display available slots and device options for each one.
- 0.140u2            : MESS fixes [Miodrag Milanovic]: Fixed issue with image empty slot. Default for writeconfig is now 0 for MESS since it is not needed anymore. Fixed handling of mounted devices on hard reset. Unified some emuopts code and removed ifdefs.

- 0.155              : (MESS) Atari 400 progress [Fabio Priuli]: Rewritten cart emulation to use slot devices (many "mappers" do not fully work) and unified cart handling among 8bit home computers, XEGS and Atari 5200. Added support for loading carts with bankswitch to all XL/XE models. Added support for loading XEGS carts in Atari 8bits home computers (XEGS instead will only load XEGS games until support for the keyboard add-on is included). Big clean up of the driver, simplifying memory map, removing writes to ROM, etc. Changed NOT_WORKING flag to IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS in 600XL, 65XE, 800XE and XEGS since they should now be working to the same extent of the 800XL, and bugs shall be reported. Note: As a consequence of the above changes, the new softlists a800.xml, a5200.xml and xegs.xml are not compatible anymore with 0.154: Keep the old xmls until 0.155 if you don't compile your own exe.

Acorn Archimedes / Aristocrat MK-5: Added Force IRQ/FIRQ hook-up and hooked up an undefined behaviour for a timer check, fixes CPU check during POST. Implemented I2C accesses to the Acorn Archimedes / Aristocrat MK-5 HW, fixing SRAM check. Added clock read-back register to the I2C device. Fixed the sound DMA in Acorn Archimedes / Aristocrat MK-5, adding sound support to the drivers. Made the I2C clock bit to be AA-specific. Fixed VIDC CRTC behaviour.

I16.7   Amiga

- 0.189              : Corrected filenames and added undumped 4.6 and 5.92 versions (amiga\zorro\a590.cpp) [Dirk Best].
- 0.187              : Corrected density (DSQD->DSDD; formats\afs_dsk.cpp) [Nigel Barnes].
- 0.186              : Attached orphaned software lists (drivers\amiga.cpp) [Nigel Barnes]. Use correctly sized bootroms for the A1000 [Guru].
- 0.185              : Killed anonymous timer and hooked amigaaga_flop software list to the A1200 driver [Osso].
- 0.183              : Added bus\amiga\keyboard\a1200.cpp/h, a500.cpp/h and keyboard.cpp/h. Converted the Amiga keyboards to a bus interface with slot devices. Added a German A500 keyboard variant, keyboard fixes [Dirk Best]. Use virtual method for Amiga keyboard interface (amiga\keyboard\keyboard.h). Amiga keyboard updates: Fixed Shift-Alt combinations with natural keyboard. Fixed crash on keyboard inputs with four characters. Corrected polarity of KB_DATA from Amiga to keyboard. Completely rewrote 68HC05CxA-based A1200 keyboard device, now working. Fixed KB_DATA mixing in A500 keyboard. Made A500 keyboard caps lock LED output name consistent with A1200. Added Alt- and Alt-Shift- characters to A500 US keyboard. Fixed natural keyboard modifiers with LLE keyboards. Put Amiga keyboard implementations in a namespace. Factor out matrix keys to a common module shared by A500/A1200. Make new German matrix based on US matrix with Alt-chars hooked up. Removed outdated comment. Added layouts for France/Belgium, Italy and Sweden/Finland. Removed some Alt- chars from Germany/Austria layout so natural keyboard produces canonical keystroke. Added borderline usable dead keys for natural keyboard (also applies to A1200 keyboard). To use dead keys, you need to type the acent character combined with a space, followed by the letter.  For example if the host system is a Mac with U.S. or similar keyboard selected, you can type Ã in the emulated system in natural keyboard mode with Option-Shift-N Shift-A (with emulated keyboard, it's Alt-J Shift-A in most keyboard layouts). Refactor function keys, keypad, etc. into a common set of inputs. Added layouts for Spain, Denmark, Switzerland, Norway and UK. Switzerland has French/German config option, natural mode only works for French [Vas Crabb].
- 0.182              : Added machine\a1200kbd.cpp/h. Added A1200 keyboard skeleton device (needs MC68HC05Cx support) [Dirk Best].
- 0.181              : Cleanups and fixes to zorro\buddha.cpp, still not working due to various issues. It uses IDE command c5 (write multi) which our IDE emulation doesn't seem to handle correctly [Dirk Best]. Removed a couple of driver_data() calls [smf].

- 0.164              : Fixed Amiga CRC in formats\flopimg.c (fixes ADF) [O. Galibert].
- 0.156              : Use memarray for chip RAM and regular array for custom registers (instead of shared_ptr for both) [Alex Jackson]. Added Workbench 1.3.3 [Guru]. Added Workbench 1.3.3 and AmigaOS 3.5 to workbench list [Dirk Best].
- 0.155              : Implement the Amiga 500 low-level keyboard controller using the newly dumped internal ROM. Removed existing keyboard HLE (machine\mos6526.c and amigakbd.c). Silence keyboard log spam and fixed internal ROM filename (machine\amigakbd.c). Fixed Amiga 600 IDE hard disk regression (machine\gayle.c). Added preliminary software lists for the Amiga 1000 and Amiga 3000, a general workbench list and an application list for testing. Images in those lists are either verified good or best available currently. Many images are still missing. Update Amiga 3000 Kickstart info. Added keyboard reset circuit. You can now reset the Amiga with the usual Ctrl-Amiga-Amiga key combination. Added the latest version of EmuTOS to the Amiga 1000 softlist and fix CIA interrupts getting lost in certain situations. This fixes the EmuTOS keyboard and potentially more. Also fix a possible issue with blitter delays. Softlist update, added Workbench 1.3.2 DE and some apps. Added save state support to the Amiga keyboard and some info about A1000 keyboards (machine\amigakbd.c). Display more info about Amiga images (imgtool\modules\amiga.c). Fixed crash with expansion slot devices (bus\amiga\zorro\zorro.c). Connect Zorro interrupts in the Amiga 500 drivers and reinitialize Zorro devices on reset to stop them from disappearing on soft reset. Fixed expansion slot device initialization (bus\amiga\zorro\zorro.c). Added an initial software list for some Amiga driver disks [Dirk Best].
- 0.154              : Removed machine\6526cia.c/h, amigacd.c/h and amigacrt.c/h. Added emu\bus\amiga\zorro\a2052.c/h, a2232.c/h, a590.c/h, action_replay.c/h, buddha.c/h, cards.c/h, zorro.c/h, machine\autoconfig.c/h, cr511b.c/h, dmac.c/h and gayle.c/h. Some more core cleanup (mess\drivers\amiga.c and machine\amigacd.c). Amiga modernization [Miodrag Milanovic]. Fixed usage of uninitialized members in amiga_sound_device [Oliver Stöneberg]. Big Amiga cleanup and reorganizaton. CDTV temporarily broken. Lots of work still to do. All basic Amiga models are now supported to varying degrees. Created a GAYLE device, used by the A600 and A1200, and implement the internal IDE controller for both. Implement internal IDE controller for the Amiga 4000. Fixed RTC hookup in Amiga 3000 and 4000. Set RP5C01 RTC to actually return 24 hour mode, which fixes RTC detection for the Amiga. Fixed A3000 RTC tag. Kill the legacy CIA emulation and fix Agnus ID for A2000 and A500. CIA changes: Added missing virtual keyword to actually call the right TOD clock. Outputs depend on the input state (fixes A1000 overlay switch). Switching to serial output mode with one-shot activated causes a pulse on SP (correct? needed for keyboard handshake). Serial input is clocked by the CNT input, not the default clock. Mask offsets to 4 bits. Writing the Timer High register with one-shot activated immediately causes the timer to be latched and the timer started, regardless of timer start value. Support PAL/NTSC switch for machines equipped with an ECS Agnus chip or better. Fixed some Zorro slot bugs. Added the Commodore A2052 Zorro-II card as an example for a basic memory expansion. Added the Buddha IDE controller Zorro-II card (not working yet though). Added support for interlaced modes. Currently, this basically emulates a "flickerfixer" device because the core doesn't have native interlace support yet. Added support for the Commodore A2232 Serial Card. Fixed WD33C93 device tag. Disable screen mode logging. TODO: Only update screen mode if it actually changes. Changed constants to enum to avoid some issues with debug builds (includes\amiga.h). Added the Logica Diagnostic ROM 2.0 to various machines. Fixed A4000 kickstart selection. Added proper RS-232 port emulation. Rendering update, always render the full height to allow mixed mode screens. LACE and LOF bits should now work closer to the real system. Emulate DIWHIGH register for ECS machines, reduce some code duplication. Added very basic POT counter emulation, enough for Space Ranger (Arcadia, V 2.0) to detect the second button [Dirk Best]. Added writing to Amiga FDC: Formatting a floppy under A600 gets memory corruption then a guru meditation when reaching the point the system tries to write the directory structure. The fdc itself does not seem to be involved. I'd suspect the blitter, which afaik is used for the mfm expansion of the sector data [O. Galibert]. Added version 6.1 bootroms for the A590/A2091 and RAM controller PAL [Guru].
- 0.153              : Added a pair of functions to the driver class (mess\drivers\amiga.c) [Osso]. Removed DEVCB_DEVICE_HANDLER and DEVCB_DEVICE_LINE. CIA cleanup (machine\amigacd.c, amigafdc.c and amigacrt.c). Converted machine\amigakbd.c to DEVCB2. 6526cia DEVCB2 temporarily until mos6526 works with Amiga. Cleaned up CIA access a bit [Curt Coder]. Fix for Amiga regression, this made infinite loop (machine\6526cia.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.150              : Modernized the Amiga sound device [Osso].
- 0.149              : Fix a3000/a3000n regression [Wilbert Pol].

- 0.148u2            : Fixed uninitialized variable in machine\amigafdc.c [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.148u1            : Added info to Amiga ECS softlist [LoganB]. Amiga / CD32 tagmap cleanups. Thinking about it these must be hashlookups too, we were converting the param to a char* string and passing it to ioport(). Further reductions in Amiga [David Haywood]. Fixed compiler warnings (drivers\cd32.c and machine\amiga.c) [Oliver Stöneberg]. Added a few more dumps from CAPS releases to amigaaga/amigaocs.xml softlist [Kaylee].
- 0.148              : Added ADKCONR hook-up to amigafdc.c, fixes at least sound in Ocean's Beach Volley. Log DSKDAT / DSKDATR (machine\amigafdc.c and amiga.c) [Angelo Salese]. Amiga SL improvements (amiga/amigaaga_flop.xml). huffle floppies around based on minimum chipset requirement. Amiga lists shuffle around, document Assassins PD collections from TOSEC ( + some other images I found which are missing from TOSEC..). Better documentation of the discs. Note about virus infected original discs (mastered with viruses) [David Haywood].
- 0.147u4            : Added preliminary artwork LEDs for Commodore Amiga (open to suggestions). Added LOF bit in Amiga emulation, used by Twintris to boot. Fixed cia_1 clocks, makes North & South and Fred happy. Added a note regarding disk swapping. Very preliminary RAW params usage for Amiga based machines in MESS, pending further info [Angelo Salese].
- 0.147u3            : Added A3000 system software. Added missing A3000 tape files to software list [Curt Coder]. Improved the inputs in CD32 (by adding a mirror of the first button where the regular Amiga reads it) this allows the majority of the booting CD32 games to actually be started. Expanded cd32.xml softlist entries to highlight more future test cases [David Haywood].
- 0.147u2            : Added very preliminary softlist for game disks [Fabio Priuli]. Renamed machines to ami500n/p & ami1000n/p and added placeholder lists for system disks. More amiga movement [David Haywood]. Unified floppy tags on other drivers as well. Changed to subdevice for amiga_fdc. Put back amiga to use well known a500, a600, a1200,... names [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.147              : Made Amiga keyboard a device, and removed legacy port changed support [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.146u5            : Kale levels up, Kale learns MCFG_LASERDISC_OVERLAY_CLIP (drivers\deco_ld.c and video\amiga.c) [Angelo Salese].
- 0.144u5            : MESS sync (machine\amigafdc.c) [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.144              : Upgrade amigafdc. My addition of the Amiga FDC to the Amiga arcade hardware was frighteningly incomplete [O. Galibert].

- 0.142              : Fixed address_space::unmap_write to pass ROW_WRITE instead of ROW_READWRITE (emu\memory.h). Fixes Amiga breakage [Aaron Giles].
- 0.141u3            : Amiga video: Removed additional 2 cycles, in move operation, for non-Agnus registers. Set to #0 the start cycle in the copper operation. Simplified code. Fixed a wrong value [Roberto Zandona].
- 0.139u4            : Converted amiga drivers to use driver_devices. Merged common code between legacy Amiga and AGA video systems [Atari Ace]. Amiga video: Improved offset in copper waiting. Revert to previous code; the change breaks ar_fast [Roberto Zandona].

- 0.132              : Amiga Custom sound: As part of the conversion of custom sound devices, the sound chip for Amiga-hardware games is now named "Amiga Custom" on the Game Information display. The Amiga sound chip was called Paula, so it would be nicer to show that instead, as in the attached patch. You could also use "MOS 8364" but that's not as catchy [Justin Kerk].
- 0.131u3            : WIP driver for Cubo CD32: AGA palette. AGA bitplane data fetching. Support for up to 8 standard bitplanes. HAM8 mode [Mariusz Wojcieszek].
- 0.128u7            : Added running_machine callbacks for the Amiga code [Nathan Woods].

Modified machine\amiga.c to use this information so that we guarantee a call to amiga_render_scanline() regardless of the video state. Fixes 01521: ar_sdwr: Game hangs on title screen [Aaron Giles].
- 0.123u4            : Converted Amiga based games to partial updating and proper scanline based timers [Zsolt Vasvari].
- 0.122u4            : Updated emu\drivers\xtal.h and mame\includes\amiga.h [Dirk Best].
-  4th December  2006: Aaron Giles - It should be pretty obvious with the update to the Dragon's Lair driver in 0.110u4 that something is brewing on the laserdisc front. There has been a lot of discussion over the years about how to make it happen, what video formats to use, etc, etc. In the end, it seemed that nobody was ever happy enough with the proposed ideas to actually take them and run. But with the discs and equipment getting older and older, and my (relatively) recent success in reading an NFL Football CED (http://www.cedmagic.com/featured/nfl.html) (thanks to Tim's (http://arcadecollecting.com/) help), I figured it was finally time to just pick a direction and move forward. One of the big stumbling blocks is that pretty much all existing video compression algorithms are heavily patented. Which means that for freely developed and freely available software, there isn't really a good way of utilizing standards such as MPEG. Plus, MPEG hardly qualifies as 'archival' quality. For this reason, MAME will be going its own way, but it won't be straying too far from the usual paths. The container format for the data will be CHD (which originally stood for Compressed Hard Drive, but has since been redubbed as Compressed Hunks of Data). Each frame, including audio and video data, will be a fixed length (some frames will have one fewer audio sample due to rounding, but this is easy to compute). The video frame rate, height, width, audio sample rate, and number of channels will be encoded in the CHD metadata. Each frame is independently compressed. Audio data is stored as multiple 16-bit channels at an arbitrary sample rate (we will be shooting for 44.1kHz stereo during sampling). The audio data is compressed losslessly using Huffman-compressed deltas. This gives a nice compromise between storing the data raw and doing something more complex and aggressive like FLAC. Audio data is just a drop in the bucket anyway from a data rate perspective, so why skimp? This compression may also be used in the future for CHD-CD's with audio tracks, and for systems that read/playback tape-based data. Video data compression is still being fine-tuned, and is waiting some good quality source data to experiment with, both animated and filmed. At a minimum, a lossless compression based on Huffman-compressed per-channel (Y,Cb,Cr) deltas will be available. This is essentially what HuffYUV does. I have also written a lossy DCT-based compressor that is tuned for archival purposes rather than bit rate limiting. That is, with an MPEG compressor you specify your data rate, and the compressor quantizes the DCT coefficients to fit the data rate. With our video compression, you specify a maximum error and a maximum average error for each channel, and the compressor tweaks the quantization on each 8x8 block indepedently to ensure that those criteria are met. The source material will be sampled at DVD resolutions (720x486 for NTSC video) in 'uncompressed' form - which is actually slightly compressed in that it is 4:2:2 subsampled, so each Cr and Cb sample covers two pixels horizontally. This is oversampling for laserdisc video, but it's better to have more data than not enough data. This effectively gives you 16 bits per pixel uncompressed, or 720 x 486 x 2 = 699,840 bytes per frame. Add in a frames' worth of audio data (assuming 29.97fps) at 44100Hz gives an extra 5886 bytes, for a total per-frame average of 705,726 bytes (5.4 MBits) per frame. Once you start multiplying that out, it's a lot of data: 20.6 MB/second, 1.18 GB/minute, or 70.9 GB/hour. Most video game laserdiscs are CAV, which maxes out at 54000 frames, or just over 30 minutes. Lossless tends to give you between 2:1 and 3:1 compression. Going up to lossy with medium deltas (up to 4/256 per component) gets you closer to 4:1 and 5:1 compression with almost no visible difference. Increasing the max deltas beyond that helps further with compression, but it definitely starts to become visible. Not everything is nailed down yet, and it will probably take a couple of months to materialize, but those are the basics. The first game I'm looking at is obviously Dragon's Lair, but coincidentally, I just received in the mail a driver for the American Laser Games series (http://www.dragons-lair-project.com/tech/pages/alg.asp) of shooters as well, which were all run on an Amiga 500 with a genlock. Fortunately, the Amiga emulation is pretty decent these days, so things are progressing well there. Now that the basic system is up and running, I'm hoping others can help get the rest of the laser games moving forward. In 0.110u4 I included support for a couple of common laserdisc players. Even though you can't see any video yet, you can at least watch their operation to see if things are working properly. In 0.110u5 I'll have support for the Sony LDP-1450 (http://www.dragons-lair-project.com/tech/ldguide/sony.asp) laserdisc player and the ability to display dummy frames (each frame is solid color and gets a unique Cb/Cr value) so that you get a little better sense of the operation. And hopefully in the next month or so, I'll have the first video running at last...
- 25th April     2006: Aaron Giles - Turns out, the Amiga has a pretty basic 4-channel DMA driven 8-bit sample playing set of DACs, and it only took a couple of days to get the sound going. But by this time, I was intrigued. I had managed to track down a used copy of the Amiga Hardware Reference Manual and as I read more about the Copper and the Blitter and the custom registers, it sounded like more and more of an interesting emulation challenge. Most of the Arcadia games already worked pretty well, but there were still glitches in a few of them, and Up Scope and Moonquake were two other Amiga-based games that weren't yet in MAME. With that incentive, I started delving into the existing implementation of the system. Although the Amiga implementation in MAME hasn't been around that long officially, I knew that Ernesto Corvi had worked on it on and off for a few years even before it made its debut. At the time, the original driver was written to be fairly low-impact, meaning it was reasonably optimized and made fairly poor documentation of how the system worked in exchange for speed (though by comparison to the UAE code, it was clear as a bell). I set out to change that. The first thing that needed an overhaul was the video renderer. I noticed that Moonquake ran in extra half-bright mode, which wasn't supported, so I first tried to fix that. Along the way, I discovered that a lot of assumptions were being made in the code which would ensure that features such as dual playfield scolling and collision detection would not work without a substantial rewrite. A substantal rewrite ensued. Of course, rendering on the Amiga is driven to a large extent by the Copper chip, and as I started to look into that, I realized that Magic Johnson's Fast Break (a)bused the Copper to jam multiple sprites and scrolling displays along the top and bottom of the screen. Which meant I needed to overhaul how sprite drawing worked in order to support these 'manually drawn' sprites, and I also needed to tweak with the timing in the Copper code so that it changed the sprites at just the right instant within a given scanline. I'm still not convinced I have the sprite rendering and Copper timing just right, but it's good enough for the games we've got. Then I wanted to understand this Autoconfig thing. There were some references to Autoconfig in the Arcadia driver, which is how expansion cards were plug & played on the Amiga. Taking the existing implementation at face value, I abstracted out the Autoconfig system so that MESS could eventually use it to plug in peripheral cards, and then I reconnected the expansion card in the Arcadia so that it worked via the Autoconfig mechanism. Of course, after doing that work, I am now convinced that it is wrong. First off, it doesn't make sense that a custom piece of hardware like the Arcadia would bother to implement anything as elaborate as the Autoconfig protocol. Second, the first word of the Arcadia BIOS ROM is a standard Amiga 'ROMtag', and if you map the BIOS up into the Fxxxxx space it boots fine without any Autoconfig mumbo-jumbo. And third, the docs say that the Arcadia systems ran off the Kickstart 1.2 boot ROM. But when you boot an Autoconfig device with the Kickstart 1.2 boot ROM, you run into a bug in the 1.2 code that causes a crash on startup if the device has a boot ROM (you can tell it's a bug because it is very clearly fixed in the 1.3 version of the ROM). I suppose the documentation about the 1.2 boot ROM could be wrong. After all, up until now the Arcadia systems all ran fine with the Kickstart 1.3 boot ROM, right? Well, actually, no. I now have proof that the original system couldn't have run off the 1.3 boot ROM. Sidewinder, a vertical shooter, always had particularly odd problems. The background bitmap would wrap strangely, and when you shot, you would hit random targets in the middle of nowhere. I tracked this down yesterday to code that would attempt to blit data from one bitmap to another, but which would somtimes specify the destination to be a location outside of RAM somewhere. Until recently, there had been a hack in the blitter that would throw away accesses outside of chip RAM, but I knew that was wrong because the documentation is very clear that outside accesses would wrap around and clobber important bits of program code. Looking into this problem more closely, it turns out that the blitting code was doing a bunch of careful 16-bit calculations in the low half of the 68000's D1 register, and then at the end, adding the full 32-bit D1 value to the address. Which means it was assuming that the upper half of the register was 0. Tracing backwards, it was clear that this code was called as part of the VBLANK interrupt routine, and the code which put the non-zero data in the upper half of D1 was the part of the Amiga Kickstart ROM which actually handled the first part of the interrupt. Comparing that same section of code between the 1.2 and 1.3 Kickstart ROMs revealed very different register usage patterns, and sure enough, booting the system under the 1.2 Kickstart ROM produces no invalid blitter accesses and yes, all the graphics problems are fixed. Of course, prior to discovering the Kickstart problem, I thought for sure it was a bug in the blitter. So yes, I ended up rewriting the blitter routines as well, attempting to document them moreso than optimize them. Which in the end was a good thing as I managed to somehow fix the blitting problems in SportTime Bowling. By this time, I'd rewritten 80% of the emulation, so finishing it off by rewriting the 8520 CIA I/O routines and cleaning up the rest of the driver goes without saying. If I had the time, I'd probably play around with the Amiga emulation in MESS, now that I've made a number of fixes and improvements to the system, but there are more pressing matters, as always. Oh, and what about Up Scope and Moonquake? More later.
- 29th June      1999: Ernesto Corvi sent a preliminary Arcadia system driver, which is basically just an Amiga 500 modified for arcade usage.

This sllows us to connect the correct line for vblank in segac2 without the previous hack.  Also looking to untangle the screen timing a bit. The 'new' renderer now only outputs a scanline and must be serviced by a partial update, i've turned it on for segac2 for now, with my initial goal being to untangle the segac2 palette handling from the vdp, it's external circuitry, mixing the raw digital output of the vdp rather than after cram data has been applied [David Haywood].
- 0.146              : Initial work in preparation for some modernization on the whole megadriv.c file, starting with better splitting of actual drivers (megadriv.c, megacd.c, mega32x.c, megasvp.c and megavdp.c) [David Haywood].

Over 100 drivers and a few bus devices have been updated to use the new implementation, and a great deal of research has gone into documenting the physical location of these devices on actual PCBs in the source. Write handlers have been provided for both orthodox and somewhat less conventional memory mappings [Vas Crabb]. Fixing reported failure of netlist build (TTL74259; mame\nl.lua) [Robbbert]. Added write_d1 handler [AJR].
       - 0.127u1            : Couriersud added a new generic latch device. Generic emulation of 74LS174/175, 74LS259 and other latches. Apart from providing synched latch operation, these latches can be configured to read their input bitwise from other devices as well and individual bits can be connected to discrete nodes. Please see audio\dkong.c for examples.

       74LS629
       - 0.140u1            : Discrete Updates [Derrick Renaud]: Removed old DISCRETE_74LS624 code and replaced it with new 74LS629 based code. Updated Mario to use new DISCRETE_74LS624 and DISCRETE_XTIME_logic modules.
       - 19th October   2010: Derrick Renaud - Thanks to a patient Smitdogg, we now have this WIP. The 74LS629 is a PITA to emulate. I wanted to do a full electrical equivalent circuit in code, but it looks like it won't happen that way. There are too many non-linear inter-reactions depending on the freq and range voltages. So I settled on just getting data points from the chip and plugged the info into www.zunzun.com to get an equivalent formula. The following pic shows the measured data points I used. Notice that with the range voltage at 5V, the frequency gets lower as the modulation voltage gets lower, except at below 0.5V when the frequency starts to get higher again. The data sheet says not to use modulation voltages less then 1V for this reason. Of course no one listens. The next pic shows the modulation voltage of the walk sound, and sure enough it drops into this range. This is why I settled on an equivalent formula, instead of an electrical simulation. No major difference to the ears. Here are a couple fancy 3D pics of the interaction of the range and modulation voltages on the output frequency. The other fun thing on this chip, is that it is sensitive to heat changes. Heck I think passing airplanes have an effect on it. So the tolerance varies a bit, especially with modulation voltages under 1V, with under 0.5V being real finicky. So here is a graph of the error based on measured data and formula output. Its well within the tolerances of the IC. Listen to the attached MP3 to hear what the new code changes.

       MC3340
       - 0.127u1: Derrick Renaud added discrete sound for Starship 1. Still need to properly emulate the MC3340.
       - NOTES: The Motorola MC3340 VCA chip has logarithmic control response. Because it is designed for single supply operation, the output has a DC offset of about half the supply voltage. An op-amp is used to get the control voltage range to 1 - 10 volt. This circuit has very low distortion at moderate signal levels and low signal bleedthrough. But the CV bleedthrough is far too high for synth use. Another problem is that it won't produce 10 V p-p output level. You could add another op-amp at the output to fix this and the DC-offset. But then you would lose the main advantage with this chip, which is low parts count.

- 0.139u3            : Timers get rescheduled only if enable state has changed (timer.c) [Christophe Jaillet]. Aaron Giles added an integral device_timer_id to device timers. This is a cleaner way to differentiate between multiple timers rather than relying on the pointers. These values are also saved with the timers. Updated the few devices using device timers to leverage this. Added new function device_timer_call_after_resynch() which creates a temporary 0-length timer that calls back through the device's device_timer() method with a given device_timer_id.

Modified DISCRETE_555_CC to discharge cap due to natural losses if there is no charging current (needed by Frogs).

- 0.179              : Fixed clock regression with RP5C01. This also makes the RP5C01's NVRAM actually non-volatile (previously it would be cleared upon reset after being loaded). The RP5C01 has a power supply line but no reset signal input, so device_reset doesn't seem to make sense here [AJR].
- 0.155              : Put in a read_line for the alarm pin (machine\rp5c01.c). Added RP5C01 device to spnchout. Allow RP5C01 clock of 0. Allow RP5C01 without battery (MAME core still writes a 0-byte file tho) [hap].

- 0.146              : Update comment [hap].
- 0.123u5            : Corrado Tomaselli added some clock frequency changes which were documented in 0.123u4 but which did not apply due to operator error.
- 0.123u2            : Corrado Tomaselli reverted sound OSC of Truxton II to 27MHz/8 since the original OST runs at this speed. The PCB I measured the previous clock was 28MHz/8 and it's a different PCB version from the common one. Since MAME doesn't support multiple OSC I prefer to use the 27MHz one.
- 0.122u3            : Added emu\drivers\xtal.h. Documenting all known arcade PCB clock cystals [Guru, Aaron Giles]: Drivers should be updated to use these as a basis for their clocks, and the list should be augmented as additional crystals are found.
- 0.122u1            : Verified some cpu clocks of original boards using a frequency counter [Corrado Tomaselli]: Changed Success Joe Ym2203 clock from 3MHz to 4MHz. Changed Pang M6295 clock from 990 kHz to 1MHz. Changed Halley Comet main cpu clock to 1.664MHz (it's not a mistake, the clock is very low). Besides confirming clocks on some games, I modified: Aerofighters and Turbo Force sound Z80 to 5MHz. Midnight Resitance 68k cpu to 10MHz (20MHz crystal) and modified m6295 clock to 1MHz. Also confirmed pin 7 is high (Midnight resistance has a lot of slow downs on the PCB too).

       Atari mathbox

       - 0.149  : Modernized the MathBox device [Osso].
       - 0.148u5: Andrew Welburn removed garbage in unused bits of 4 bit mathbox proms in Star Wars (rev 2) and clone (rev 1) and clone TomCat (Star Wars hardware, prototype).
       - 0.129u5: Device-ified the Atari mathbox and the Atari vector generators [Couriersud].
       - 0.115u1: Mathis Rosenhauer moved Atari vector PROMs into separate regions.
       - 0.103u1: Mathis Rosenhauer rewrote the Star Wars mathbox multiplier from the schematics.
       - 10th December 1999: Aaron Giles fixed the speed of I, Robot's mathbox.
       - 23rd     June 1999: Mathis Rosenhauer fixed the Empire Strikes Back mathbox chip, and the 3D vectors aren't anymore corrupt sometimes.
       - 0.29   : Some fixes to the Star Wars mathbox [Aaron Giles].
       - 0.26   : Added machine\mathbox.c/h and vidhrdw\vector.c/h.



       Atarigen (General functions for Atari games)

       - 0.171: Modernized sound volume setting code in various Atari drivers. This lets atarigen.cpp shed legacy sound routines using the archaic method of looking up sound devices by types rather than tags, which until 0.126u2 they weren't required to provide and often didn't have (arcadecl.cpp, atarisy1.cpp, atarisy2.cpp, badlands.cpp, cyberbal.cpp, gauntlet.cpp, rampart.cpp, relief.cpp and machine\atarigen.cpp) [AJR].
       - 0.170: Fully disentangle Liberator from machine\atarigen.cpp. Getters for atari_vad_device return devices as references, not pointers [AJR].
       - 0.157: Fixed save state regression in various Atari drivers (machine\atarigen.c) [Osso]. Fixed attotime/flashing text in Paperboy service mode and 720 attotime/sprites flicker or disappear sometimes in recent MAME versions (machine\atarigen.c) [Alex Jackson].
       - 0.150: Disabled unused private members (machine\atarigen.h) [Oliver Stöneberg]. Added eeprompar.*, implementing a simple interface for parallel EEPROMs. Created atari_eeprom_device which wraps a 2804 or 2816 EEPROM with the standard Atari write-locking mechanism. Updated all drivers to use this, and removed all EEPROM stuff from atarigen. Added missing macros (machine\eeprompar.h) [Aaron Giles]. Fixed device description conflict [Tafoid].
       - 0.149u1: Break out the sound communications part of atarigen into its own device. Update all callers (audio\atarijsa.c, cyberbal.c, drivers\atarig1.c, atarig42.c, atarigx2.c, atarisy1.c, atarisy2.c, badlands.c, batman.c, beathead.c, blstroid.c, cyberbal.c, eprom.c, gauntlet.c, harddriv.c, offtwall.c, relief.c, skullxbo.c, thunderj.c, toobin.c, vindictr.c, xybots.c, machine\atarigen.c/h and video\atarisy1.c) [Aaron Giles]. Convert the Atari VAD chip into a device, half-way (machine\atarigen.c/h, drivers\batman.c, offtwall.c, relief.c, shuuz.c and thunderj.c) [Aaron Giles].
       - 0.147u2: Initial round of atarigen cleanup/modernization [Aaron Giles].
       - 0.145u7: Aaron Giles fixed Atari GT driver crashed after OK (atarigen_eeprom_reset regression).
       - 0.139u1: Aaron Giles changed atarigen_state to be a base class from which all the related Atari drivers derive their state from.
       - 0.135u4: Some more Atari driver shuffling [Aaron Giles]: Added atarigen_init() function which allocates all timers and registers for save states. Updated all drivers to call it. Converted some drivers to use device timers.
       - 0.123u5: Zsolt Vasvari converted atarigen and TMS34061 to be handle based.
       - 0.114u1: Aaron Giles fixed video timing in machine\atarigen.c, this fixed the graphics problems in APB.
       - 0.114  : Couriersud added general save state support to the atarigen module.
       - 0.113u1: Zsolt Vasvari began converting drivers over to the new more accurate video timing functions (video_screen_* functions instead of cpu_*). This first batch includes all the games using the TMS34010 chip and the Atari games that use atarigen.c.
       - 0.113  : Zsolt Vasvari removed cpu_gethorzbeampos() and replaced it with calls to video_screen_get_hpos(). Also changed TMS34010 configuration to take a screen number, and changed atarigen_get_hblank() to take a screen number as well.
       - 0.33b3 : Added machine\atarigen.c/h.
       - NOTES: atarigen = General functions for Atari games
       - SOURCE: machine\atarigen.c; drivers\arcadecl.c, atarig1.c, atarig42.c, atarigt.c, atarigx2.c, atarisy1.c, atarisy2.c, badlands.c, batman.c, beathead.c, blstroid.c, cyberbal.c, eprom.c, foodf.c, gauntlet.c, harddriv.c, jaguar.c, klax.c, liberatr.c, offtwall.c, rampart.c, relief.c, shuuz.c, skullxbo.c, thunderj.c, toobin.c, vindictr.c, xybots.c and audio\atarijsa.h



       Atarimo

       - 0.173  : Moved emu\sprite.cpp/h to devices\video\sprite.cpp/h.
       - 0.167  : Updated previous fix (video\atarimo.c; MAME 0.165), this fixes palette problem in thunderj [hap].
       - 0.165  : Fixed out of bounds priority check (video\atarimo.c) [hap]. This fixed graphics glitch occurs when destroying computer equipment in eprom/eprom2 (MT#05690).
       - 0.155  : Fixed video\atarimo.c:225:24: runtime error: index -4 out of bounds for type 'UINT16 [4096]' [hap].
       - 0.153  : Added asserts for known index out-of-bounds accesses (video\atarimo.c) [Oliver Stöneberg].
       - 0.150  : Convert atarimo to a device. Still a bunch more cleanup/improvements to do; this is pretty much a direct port of the existing functionality, built on top of the sprite_device [Aaron Giles]. Keep MSVC happy when compiling for x64 (video\atarimo.c; warning C4334: '<<' : result of 32-bit shift implicitly converted to 64 bits (was 64-bit shift intended?) [Phil Bennett].
       - 0.149u1: Convert the Atari VAD chip into a device, half-way. Really needs device-ification of atarimo.c to do it properly, so this will get revisited once that is complete (machine\atarigen.c/h, drivers\batman.c, offtwall.c, relief.c, shuuz.c and thunderj.c) [Aaron Giles].
       - 0.147  : Slightly less abusive gfx_element hacking in atarimo, fixing memory corruptions [Aaron Giles].
       - 0.142  : Atari Ace eliminates the extern variables from atarimo video core, in order to remove a significant source of AM_BASE macros.

       Atarirle

       - 0.150: Moved tilemap_memory into a generic memory_array class, since it is more generally useful than just in tilemaps. Code is now in memarray.*. Converted the Atari RLE motion objects device from a half-assed device into a full-assed device, leveraging the memory_array class [Aaron Giles].
       - 0.141u3: Atari Ace converted atarirle to a device. Moved a driver specific routine to a generic device file (video\atarimo).
       - 10th June 2002: Brad Oliver fixed bugs in the Revolution X driver and Atari RLE decoding that affected MacMAME.
       - 0.60   : Removed vidhrdw\atarian.c/h and ataripf.c/h.

       NOTES:
       - Custom chip 55 provides two playfields of 4bpp tiles, with optional rowscroll and column scroll. Some games use two of these to give 4 playfields. Palette banking, tile banking and priority are outside the scope of this chip, and usually differ between games. Some games combine the 4bpp output of each playfield to give an effective 8bpp display.
       - Custom chip 56 is the same as 55 but with on-chip decryption, so encrypted roms can be used.
       - Custom chip 74 is the same as 56 but with different decryption tables.
       - Custom chip 141 appears to be the same as 56.

Modernization of decocomn device (drivers\boogwing.c, cninja.c, dassault.c, dietgo.c, pktgaldx.c, rohga.c and video\decocomn.c/h) [Osso].
       - 0.148u4            : Added rest of deco16ic_device (drivers\cbuster.c/h, dblewing.c, dietgo.c/h, dreambal.c, funkyjet.c/h, pktgaldx.c/h, supbtime.c/h, tumblep.c/h, vaportra.c/h and includes\deco32.h and video\deco32.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
       - 0.136u4            : Moved includes\deco16ic.h to video\deco16ic.h. Fabio Priuli implemented device version of the deco16ic tilemap chip and renamed decodev->deco16ic.

       DECO BAC06
       - 0.153              : Reverted changes to decbac06 device flipscreen support, now that this can be done properly. Also reverted the decmxc06 changes. This breaks again the flipped sprites in some games, but fixes the actfanct regression [Osso].
       - 0.149u1            : Modernization DECO BAC06 device (drivers\actfancr.c, dec0.c, dec8.c, madmotor.c, pcktgal.c, stadhero.c and video\decbac06.c/h). Modernization of the remainder of the deco_bac06 device [Osso].
       - 0.148              : Save ram properly (video\decbac06.c), added a note about flipscreen behavior as a reminder for reimplementing flips on some of these games later [David Haywood].
       - 0.142              : Added video\decbac06.c/h and deckarn.c/h. Converted DECO BAC06 tilemap (used by dec0.c) to be a device, reducing code duplication [David Haywood].
       - DRIVERS: actfancr.cpp, dec0.cpp, dec8.cpp, madmotor.cpp, pcktgal.cpp and stadhero.cpp

       - 0.158              : Added a workaround for MT04724 (oscar, oscaru, oscarj1, oscarj2, cobracom, cobracomj: Screen flipping is no more working) and MT04797 (All sets in dec0.c: Flip Screen/Cocktail Mode offset), until all drivers are updated to use RAW_PARAMS [Osso].
       - 0.153              : Reverted changes to decbac06 device flipscreen support, now that this can be done properly. Also reverted the decmxc06 changes. This breaks again the flipped sprites in some games, but fixes the actfanct regression [Osso].
       - 0.146u2            : Added basic support for the bootleg sprites used by automat and secretab [David Haywood].
       - 0.142              : Added video\decmxc06.c/h. Started moving common DECO MXC06 sprite controller code to it's own device files, reducing code duplication [David Haywood].
       - DRIVERS: actfancr.cpp, dec0.cpp, dec8.cpp, madmotor.cpp, stadhero.cpp, thedeep.cpp and vaportra.cpp

       DECO 52
       - 0.174              : Fixed flipscreen in Double Wings and Multi Champ (video\decospr.cpp) [Osso].
       - 0.154              : Converted to use delegates + some cleanups (video\decospr.c) [Fabio Priuli].
       - 0.145u7            : Discovered similarities in gotcha.c to Data East Bootleg sprites, also happening to be the closest implementation to Silver Millennium in the sources. Refactored each based on this information (video\gotcha.c and video\decospr.c) [David Haywood].
       - 0.144u7            : Converted Boogie Wings, Lemmings, Rohga, Schmeiser Robo, Thunder Zone/Desert Assault and Wizard Fire to use generic DECO sprite implementation (video\decospr.c) [David Haywood].
       - 0.141u4            : Added video\decospr.c/h. Put DECO 52 video sprite chip inside its own file. Allow rendering to a bitmap, with priority data intact, for manual mixing. Thought drawgfx was optimized for single line cliprects, or at least capable of rejecting sprites based on y position and cliprect in non-zoomed cases.  it seems I was either wrong, or that functionality is broken, because checking it manually prevents the captaven intro from becoming stupidly slow with partial updates [David Haywood].

       DECO 104
       - 0.150              : Started integrating DECO104 findings from Charles, done a preliminary hookup of Double Wings to it (input ports bit order not yet verified). Nuked old bad simulation code for DW. Started pushing other games through the new 104 code, removed the old simulations [Charles MacDonald, David Haywood]. Make Pocket Gal Deluxe use the new DECO104 code, it has a different scramble on the address lines just to make things annoying even if the checks are trivial (drivers\pktgaldx.c and machine\deco104.c). Incorporate extra 104 findings from Charles, will clean up as next step. 104 table reformat and info update [David Haywood]. Removed some commented out code from the old, not existing anymore Deco104 simulation (drivers\boogwing.c, dietgo.c, pktgaldx.c and rohga.c) [Osso].
       - 0.149u1            : Changed machine\decoprot.c and includes\decoprot.h to machine\deco104.c/h. Moved Double Wings protection sim to the DECO 104 file - no functional change. Start reworking some of the 104 bits to make things easier later down the line. Switched the Wizard Fire reads around too so that they are more correct and align with Rohga. Shuffle Double Wings address bits around too. Make Caveman Ninja read addresses closer to Rohga / Wizard Fire etc. Bring the Double Wings addresses properly into line too. Refactor DECO104 to pump most games through a standard function. Let Double Wings share the common protection handlers for ones we already know from other games, might make things worse due to the missing ones thos. Night Slashers and Dream Ball using generic DECO 104 protection. Fixed save states [David Haywood].

       DECO 146
       - 0.174              : Temp fix to regain speed in Edward Randy and clones (and quite possibly more) by commenting select logerrors that are spammed unmerciful causing extreme performance degradation (machine\deco146.cpp) [Tafoid].
       - 0.150              : Fixed DECO 146 compile [Alex Jackson].
       - 0.149u1            : Added machine\deco146.c/h. Begin creation of modern DECO 146 device with info from Charles MacDonald (machine\deco146.c/h; drivers\sshangha.c). Changed a few bits around based on discussion, still not right. Different (better/more correct) interpretation of Charles' data after some discussions. Reformat DECO 146 in a bit but you can start Super Shanghai Dragon's Eye now at least. Looks like the original might not need / use quite the same video hacks as the bootleg. Improved formatting of table. Hooked up the new DECO 146 sim side-by-side with the original in Edward Randy, it does seem that chip had the same functionality even if it was marked differently. Experiment with Mutant Fighter and DECO 146 protection. It's also similar, if not the same. Funky Jet works with the new code too, note the address bitswap is the *reverse* of the one to get from Fighters History to Nitro Ball format. I suspect there is a way to get from where we are to both of those too, and that there are in reality 2 different chip types 146 (+ various rebadges of it) and 104. Moved some functions around for further research and studying. Switch around the address bits on output port handling on the Fighters History / Nitro Ball type. This brings special sound/xor/mask ports to the same as shanghai etc. and also keeps values in the 0-127 range. This is most likely the unscrambled state based on tests. Still need to investigate the read side of it. Should be no functional change. Re-order Fighters History / Nitroball read in the same way, this makes the read ports consistent with robocop 2 and Lemmings... although I can't find a connection with shanghai on the read addresses, seems like an alt mode maybe? Moved the bit reordering out of 'core' function and into the per-game ones for Nitrobal and Fighters History. Collapse bitswaps (Fighters History out ports now use the same swap as Funky Jet) also reformat before further work. A magic address xor means Nitro Ball can work with DECO 146 code. Used info from Charles to fill in some missing remaps on IO ports. Removed the 'UNEMULATED PROTECTION' flag from Fighters History, for the first time ever you can actually play it until the end (previously the last 2 bosses would glitch because the protection results were missing; need to look at the video mixing bug causing bad BG colour in test mode still). Try a different bg pen in fghthist. Pump Stadium Hero '96 through generic 146 code. Put Captain America, Diet Go Go, Dragon Gun, Lemmings and Robocop 2 through the generic protection implementation. Fixed save states [David Haywood].
       - 14th July      2013: Charles MacDonald - Data East 146 chip: Thanks to The Dumping Union I was able to purchase a "Super Shanghai Dragon's Eye" PCB. The board was designed by Data East for Hot-B and is mostly identical to other Data East boards of the same time period. This board needed PAL dumps and had some emulation problems in MAME prompting further investigation into the 146 protection chip. I made a few modifications to the board for finer control of the 146 and have been developing and testing a lot of trojan programs to figure out how the chip works. I haven't gotten around to adding my findings to MAME and I won't have time to do so for a while, so I've decided to put up the relevant documentation. It's mostly complete and should be able to augment the existing 146 emulation to help Super Shanghai and other games. I'd really like to do more work with the other Data East protection chips because they seem very similar to the 146. If anyone can help out with providing any of the 68000-based games that use these chips (such as Robocop 2, Rohga, etc.) maybe we can complete the emulation for them as well. I've finished a new PAL dumper design. Many ideas from the previous 68000-based prototype have been refined and implemented in the new one, which had design goals of lowering cost and simplifying assembly. Adding a proper ZIF socket and a software controlled power supply makes it easy to swap out chips when dumping, and allowed me to dump a box of 60 PALs in about an hour. The control software has more exhaustive tests to identify and confirm registered devices so you can easily tell how GAL chips are programmed and how they should be dumped. This version supports 20 and 24-pin combinatorial devices and dumping of 20-pin registered devices. I've finished the new combinatorial dump analyzer, and am working on adding more devices to the registered dumping software. Then I can start work on the analysis program to convert registered dumps back into human-readable logic which should be quite a challenge. Even if that proves too troublesome, we still have a way to preserve all the data in registered PALs now, and the analysis software can follow at a later time.

       WIP:
       - 0.189           : Decrypted clone Virtua Bowling (Hong Kong, V101HJS) and added its own bitswaps for IGS003 and IGS011. Found dipswitches to perform a protection test in Virtua Bowling.

Added partial dump of internal rom from IGS game 'The Gladiator' - it's missing the first 0x188 bytes which are execute-only, unfortunately the code jumps to them in multiple places and it appears to be important so it still doesn't work (machine\pgmprot_igs027a_type3.c). Idle skip for theglad. Still don't understand current behavior tho, code is very similar in places to killbldp. Improved notes in machine\pgmprot_igs027a_type3.c. Changed so that the intro runs, but it can no longer be started, but at least this is a more proper flow. Document another finding in pgmprot_igs027a_type3.c. More sensible stack location to prevent crashes/glitches and shuffle some code about [David Haywood].
       - 0.151           : Added machine\igs022.c/h, igs025.c/h and igs028.c/h. Improvements to Dragon World 3 protection simulation, game seems mostly playable now although a DMA mode copying 68k code to RAM is still missing [iq_132]. Couple of tweaks to the PGM submission (machine\pgmprot_igs025_igs022.c). Added igs025/igs022 DMA mode 4 for drgw3. Small fix to unbreak killbld from iq132. Refactor some IGS protection code for easier sharing between IGS017 and PGM driver. Further refactoring (drivers\igs017.c, machine\igs025.c andn pgmprot_igs025_igs022.c). Fixed broken DMA mode and minor tweak (machine\igs022.c). Shunt some IGS code around. Improved IGS028 [David Haywood].
       - 0.150           : Make Puzzli 2 play some intro music (machine\pgmprot_igs027a_type1.c). Some of the other Z80 pointers on puzzli2. Added couple of ugly hacks to protection sim while I figure things out properly, these will go away shortly. Added extra protection value. More research, need to start joining the dots. More notes. Added logic for the graphic offset / palette commands. Further logic improvement for protection. Level data stream notes. Misc puzzli2 guesses. Tidy up some no longer needed pgm/puzzli2 bits notes. Must also read back the cart region here when the reset command is issued, also applied same logic to our other sims (includes\pgm.h and machine\pgmprot_igs027a_type1.c) [David Haywood].
       -  3rd August 2013: David Haywood - This is possibly a bit of a premature announcement because I don't consider the game to be working yet but I've spent a large amount of the past week looking at the IGS game 'Puzzli 2' with some real hardware assistance from rtw. As with almost all IGS games of this period there is an MCU on the board providing certain functions for use by the main game code. The ultimate goal is to find a way to trick the MCU into spilling out it's internal ROM and simply emulate the ARM CPU program contained inside but in some cases that isn't possible because the MCU is not using any commands with unchecked lookups into internal ROM. After running a data logger on the Puzzli 2 board and watching what it wrote to and read from the device it quickly appeared Puzzli 2 was one of those cases, all functions were work on the data passed in, transform it and give it back in another format. There are 3 main functions the Puzzli 2 MCU provides, first, descrambling of the addresses where the Z80 code is stored for sound / music, this was the first thing I hooked up after studying the logs (albeit with hardcoded addresses because the scramble isn't clear) It was also confirmed that the device provides the correct addresses for Puzzli 2 or Puzzli 2 Super depending on which game code you have running, so clearly the addresses returned are derived from the data passed to the device at startup. The second function is providing offsets to where graphics / palettes are stored. This is used for the random tiles shown during the intro animation and all the backgrounds. In the end this turned out to be a two step operation, the first step multiplying the two nibbles of data passed by 0x19 and 0x5, the second step being the addition of a 4-bit value to the final result. The third, and by far most complex thing it does is descramble and decompress the level data structure for each level. Before each level starts the 68k passes in a stream of data from ROM, the MCU then applies a loop of 16 8-bit xor values to that data (from a 256 byte table, the first value passed is the 8-bit offset into that table) Having done that, in the same step (without revealing the intermediate results to the 68k) the MCU fills in a 10x8 structure for the level data as well as a few misc variables based on the input stream. The MCU is also responsible for flagging to the 68k when it has received enough data to build a level. The level structure is then read back with another command, again with the MCU signaling when enough data has been returned based on the data passed earlier. What this means is to simulate the protection device I had to understand the format of the source level data, and the format of the level data the game expects (sizes, object types etc.) as well as find a way to figure out the scrambling, easier said than done because you can't see the descrambled data directly, only the final level structure after the MCU has also expanded / decompressed that descrambled data. Understanding this was by far the most time consuming part and is where work still really needs to be done. The work done so far has however seen the game emulation improve significantly, many level structures are built correctly, although currently if I look at all the levels the game has several contain what appear to be invalid elements (if you put them in a level the level becomes impossible to finish) interestingly many of these are stripped from the Puzzli 2 Super rom, so I don't know if they're unused data, game bugs, or if they do something else on the level they're meant to be used (they could also be errors in my descrambling, but the xor addresses on which they fall are confirmed with other levels so that's unlikely). There are also problems with my interpretation of the 'depth' data, I think I see where it's passed and read but what I'm doing to it is clearly wrong, the width data passed at the same time appears to be processed correctly by the simulation. Depth is one of the level difficulty factors and it being wrong is causing the black bars at the bottom of some screens because it's drawing everything too high up / for an easier difficulty setting. Hopefully I can figure out the remaining issues and we can get this one marked as working in the near future. Interestingly it also points at there being a background colour register we're not emulating on PGM, unless some of the backgrounds are just glitchy on real hardware (it happens more often on games than you'd think). Even if things aren't fully working yet this felt like promising enough progress to mention it, and should give some insight into just how tricky even the easier cases can be sometimes. Also for those wondering Puzzli 2 Super is quite a significant upgrade, it adds the entire VS CPU mode, the regular Puzzli 2 only has a VS. mode for 2 players. One thing I really like about this game is the music, I find many of the tunes to be catchy and perfectly fitting for a game of this kind. I don't know if like with Bee Storm they're not all exactly original creations but I have a feeling we might find out with time if people end up matching them to source mods ;-) The intro music I'd hope is original because it syncs up so well with the intro animation and is delightfully bouncy!

Comment: Note, could still do with Andreas seeing if he can find a relationship between the encryption tables we've derived from studying the protection (used to decrypt the various blocks in the protection data rom) and the final block in the protection data rom. Put Kaneko Calc3 on it's own timer, so the driver doesn't need to keep calling run from the irq function, also cleaned up Gals Panic 3 a bit.
       - 0.133u1            : Calc 3 MCU update [David Haywood]: Shuffled a few things around based on new findings. Added an extra decryption table used for the Brap Boys startup code (still doesn't do anything interesting). Noted that one of the unknown parameters for the MCU Init command is where it reads / writes EEPROM data from. Noted that an additional parameter in the MCU commands may cause further displacement of the writeback address, as BRap Boys seems to rely on this (needs further testing) - added a hack for now so that BRap Boys places the writeback address of the initial table somewhere that causes it to get executed.

       - 28th December  2010: Andrew Gardner - A few months ago, Phil Bennett took it upon himself to tackle the Kaneko MCUs Dr. Decapitator photographed and gave to MAMEDev. I'm as good as the next guy at typing in bits, so I offered to help. The doc's images were nice, allowing us to type in all the data in a short amount of time. Phil figured out how to convert the bits to bytes, and quickly got DJ Boy to talk to the newly-typed-in (dumped) MCU. Often times, looking at the disassembly of a ROM gives a person a pretty good sense of the quality of what we have typed. Things were looking good, but there were a few errors. A little bit twiddling fixed these errors, but looking back at the original die images made us very concerned - sometimes the disassembly made Phil sure a bit should be a 1, but the die image was subtly blurry, and we both typed in a 0. Because of this, we asked for another set of images of the DJ Boy MCU from the Doc, and he very graciously gave us a higher magnification level. This new set of images was so good, it was no problem typing the whole ROM in again, and Phil hooked it up quickly and effectively. We had the same situation going on with the MCU in Heavy Unit. The doc's images were good, but not amazing. We typed them in, but asked for higher magnification images, knowing there may be some issues. Just the other day, the Doc sent us those higher resolution images. Phil typed in the images (I didn't finish my typing), fixed a couple of bits we had improperly typed with the lower-resolution images, and hooked up the MCU. The results should show up in the next release of MAME. In the meantime, David Haywood was kind enough to test out the emulation and record a video of MAME running the game Heavy Unit.
       - 20th May       2009: Guru - The 80C51 MCU from Heavy Unit has just been decapped. This is the ROM image, you can clearly see a large part of the lower section of the ROM is unused.

Updated some Konami drivers above to separately allocate palette/extra/work RAM instead of appending them to maincpu ROM; also, reduced maincpu rom regions where appropriate. Replaced memory_set_bankptr with memory_set_bank where necessary.

       - 0.110u3            : Added machine\konamiic.c.
       - 11th July 2005     : David Haywood - Its certainly not pretty, although compared to the Genesis verison its a work of art, but the Arcade version of Lethal Enforcers now works well enough in MAME to be considered 'Working'. There are still a number of glitches, of note are: Sprite Lag - Sprites seem to lag other sprites, rather strange, no idea why, maybe its correct. Sprite Positioning - may be off by 1 pixel, the first level shadow sprites don't line up if I line up the doors on the other levels, I need to see which is right, or if Konami are playing weird tricks. Shadows - Only the background gets shadowed by the shadow sprites (Glass) for some reason enemies don't, probably a limitation of the current sprite/shadow implementation in konamiic.c. Rowscroll - A rowscoll effect is used for the background on the car stage, this isn't currently emulated. Priorities should be mostly correct, scrolling is correct, gunshots seem fairly accurate (maybe very slightly above the cursor).
       - 0.98u1             : David Haywood fixed Escape Kids memory maps and video hardware (video\konamiic.c).

Removed hack to pass POST since we now do it the right way. Corrected K056832 RAM interface, added preliminary support for external linescroll RAM on the K056832. This helps with the garbage tilemaps a bit since linescroll data is no longer getting sprayed all over VRAM (note, with this update the driver was just crashing when I tested it, so maybe something is wrong).
       -  1st September 2003: R. Belmont fixed a bug in the K056832 ROM readback, so the mask ROM tests work again in some of the Konami games.

       ????? (Konami programmable amplifier chip)
       - 27th June 2006: R. Belmont - I'm doing something I meant to do years ago (but MAME wasn't capable of supporting it at the time) - emulating the Konami programmable amplifier chip. It's actually a big ceramic thing that's sadly rather fragile and it's found in games from Xexex pretty much onward. This will make the test menu volume control work in a whole bunch of games, and also effectively make the sound emulation "perfect" in them.

       - 0.60               : Added drivers\namcoic.c and includes\namcoic.h.
       - NOTES: machine\namcoio.c: Namco custom I/O chips 56XX and 58XX (plus an unknown one used only by Pac & Pal - could be "57XX", I guess). These chips work together with a 16XX, that interfaces them with the buffer RAM. Each chip uses 16 nibbles of memory; the 16XX supports up to 4 chips, but most games use only 2. The 56XX and 58XX are pin-to-pin compatible, but not functionally equivalent: they provide the same functions, but the command codes and memory addresses are different, so they cannot be exchanged. The devices have 42 pins. There are 16 input lines and 8 output lines to be used for I/O. It is very likely that the chips are standard 4-bit microcontrollers with embedded ROM, but it hasn't been determined which type. The closest match so far is the Oki MSM6408/MSM6422, but the pinout doesn't match 100%. Since the Namco customs appear to be manufactured by Fujitsu, they might be MB8851, but I haven't found data sheets nor pinouts for those devices.

AM_SHAREs in a device's internal address map or its default address map are now tagmapped as children of that device rather than siblings (analogous to how handlers in internal/default address maps are scoped).

       - 0.155              : Added video\c116.c/h. Implemented the Namco Custom 116 palette and raster IRQ controller as a device, and hooked it up to the namcos1, namconb1 and namcofl drivers [Alex Jackson].
       - NOTES: C116 controls palette RAM, blanking/clipping, and generates raster IRQs. It is paired with one of two priority mixer chips, depending on the board. On System 1, its partner is Custom 120; on System 2, NB-1, NB-2, and System FL, its partner is Custom 156. Based on schematics, C156 has more color input pins than C120 in order to support sprites with higher bit depth; other differences between the two mixer chips are unknown. The mixer (C120 or C156) outputs a 13-bit address corresponding to the color index of the highest-priority input pixel to three 6264 SRAMs, one for each of red, green and blue. The data from the RAMs is output to C116, which either sends it to the DAC or clips it to black if the beam position is outside the visible area programmed via its registers. When accessing the palette RAM from the CPU, data lines D0-D7 and address lines A11 and A12 go to C116; these two address lines select between the three RAMs and the C116 internal registers. A0-A10, A13 and A14 go to C120 or C156, which simply pass them through to the RAMs (A13 becoming A11 and A14 becoming A12).

The MMU is no longer emulated by modifying address maps at runtime, an operation which has become excessively slow as the core memory system has accumulated features and complexity over the years. Instead, the MMU is now a device which works on similar principles to the address_map_bank_device. The recent multisession regression is fixed, all games in the driver should now run substantially faster, and most importantly the driver code is now much cleaner and easier to understand [Alex Jackson].

       NMK004
       - 0.187              : Replaced fake TLCS-90 I/O space with callbacks (cpu\tlcs90\tlcs90.cpp and machine\nmk004.cpp) [AJR].
       - 0.155              : Added proper NMK004 internal rom. This fixed Source: NMK004 sound CPU is just (imperfectly) simulated [trap15]. Hooked up support for NMK004 internal rom in MAME, replacing Nicola's old simulation code [trap15, David Haywood].
       - 0.150              : Converted NMK004 to a device [Osso].
       - 22nd March     2005: Nicola Salmoria - The NMK004 cannot be dumped directly using the common methods, but the way it operates can probably be used to extract the internal ROM data in another way. The external ROM contains data tables used to play the samples and music; but not only that, it contains pointers to those tables. By changing those pointers, we can make the NMK004 use its internal ROM as if it was one of the external tables. In particular, this can be done with the table that contains the sample numbers to be played by the two OKI6295. We can then log the commands sent by the NMK004 to the OKI6295, and this will allow us to determine which sample it is attempting to play - and therefore the value of the internal ROM byte it has just read. This is still at the theorical level, until one of the hardware gurus gets his hands dirty and tries to put it in practice. So in theory there shouldn't be problems - unfortunately the hardware setup needed to get it all to work isn't trivial. But I'm confident that in due time it will be done.
       - 0.94u4             : Nicola Salmoria improved NMK004 simulation and prevented hang in Black Heart.
       - 17th March     2005: Nicola Salmoria - All NMK004 games have sound, though in some of them it's better than in others. Mustang is possibly the worst one - I have doubts about the sound ROM being a bad dump. There were a few major problems - music stopping shortly after starting, or games completely freezing MAME. I have found a bug in the loops handling which should have caused most of these problems.
       - 0.94u2             : Added machine\nmk004.c/h. NMK004 sound simulation [Nicola Salmoria].
       -  7th March     2005: Nicola Salmoria - I am at a point that I almost consider good enough. The FM part is supported as well. The state machine seems to produce the correct notes, the only strange thing is that the volume is extremely low - I had to push it to 2.0 gain and lower all the others to make it reasonable. There might be a bug somewhere in the way the FM parameters are set - this stuff is much more complex than the PSG. At this point, I'm more worried about the protection in some games than by the sound, which is coming along nicely. It has to be said that this simulation I've written was mostly for personal education and for reference. I am 99% certain the NMK004 internal ROM can be extracted, using a technique I thought of. Theoretically it's very simple, but the process will require some hardware work. And of course, once the ROM is extracted, we'll have to see if it can be ran in MAME. It supposedly is a TLCS-90, which is one of the few CPUs not yet supported by MAME, so an emulator for that CPU would have to be written. Which would be a good thing because it would also allow to support Mahjong If and sound in Rapid Hero. Having the simulation code available might help while writing the CPU emulator.
       -  6th March     2005: Nicola Salmoria - The NMK004 state machine supports: Six FM channels; each pair of them shares one of the three YM2203 voices. Three PSG channels, each one using one of the PSG voices of the YM2203. Eight Effects channels, which can use the total eight voices provided by the two Oki M6295 to play sample-based sounds like drums (but they are also sometimes used to play effects not music related). Direct triggering of Oki M6295 samples (this is not strictly part of the state machine). I am growing more and more convinced that the internal ROM of the NMK004 is the same in all games. A few of the games in the driver have additional protection issues, but at this point I don't think they are related to the NMK004. The problems with the PSG notes were just caused by a silly omission of a *2 in a table lookup. Things that happen when hacking around at 4AM. The PSG part sounds quite good now. Only the FM part is missing...
       -  4th March     2005: Nicola Salmoria - It looks like the Z80 sound program for Task Force Harrier, which is the only known game predating the introduction of the NMK004, uses a data format which is very similar to the one used by the NMK004. The main command table and the sample tables are slightly different, and the music tables look very similar if not identical. It would probably be possible to modify the Z80 program to use the different tables, but I think I'll take the longer route and rewrite the program in C - so I'll learn how a program like that works in detail, which can always be useful knowledge.
       -  3rd March     2005: Nicola Salmoria - One of the longest standing hurdles in MAME emulation is the sound in NMK/UPL games like Mustang, Vandyke, GunNail, etc. Those games use an custom CPU, labelled "NMK004", to drive the sound. It is still not known what kind of CPU it is, what's known is that it has 8 or 16kB of internal ROM which cannot be directly dumped, and which contains the whole program. The external ROM only contains data. I am convinced that the program contained inside the NMK004 is either always the same, or it has minor difference to handle protection - but the format of the data in the external ROM is always the same. What I'm trying to do at the moment is understand the format of the external data. I have started with the easy part, that is the Oki 6295 samples control. I have found the command table, and the mappingd from command to 6295 sample number. This allowed me to make the games play the correct samples at the correct time so e.g. in Vandyke I hear a "swoosh" when I swing the sword and a "uumph" when I jump. I still haven't understood all of the control bits, so it isn't perfect yet, but it's a good start for a night's work. I'm hoping that other games that use a standard Z80 instead of the NMK004 will use similar logic to drive the sound (though I have already verified that they don't use the same data format as the NMK004). Of course the YM2203 part will be much harder since it won't be just a matter of playing a few samples here and there, but I will have to fully understand how the data translates into music and drive the YM2203 accordingly. However there's nothing stopping it in principle, so I am confident that eventually I or someone else will be able to add full sound to these games.
       - 16th August    2004: Guru - The big news is in dumping the Tenkaigen MCU (A Toshiba TMP91P640N in SDIP64 package), we've realised that the sound MCU/CPU on the NMK games that use NMK004 is the same chip, just in a QFP44 package which I have support for in the programmers software! So I can dump those too, but unfortunately we'll need another adapter. This means sound in GunNail, Mustang, Acrobat Mission, Vandyke, Black Heart and possibly others that use the NMK004 chip is possible once the chip is dumped.
       - NOTES: The NMK004 CPU might be a Toshiba TLCS-90 class CPU (is similar to Z80 but with different opcodes ?) with internal ROM (?) in the 0000-3fff range.

       NMK112
       - 0.154              : Converted NMK112 to use inline config [Fabio Priuli]. Fixed uninitialized members in NMK112 and removed long-unneeded trampoline 8-bit handler [Alex Jackson].
       - 0.149              : Modernized NMK112 device (drivers\cave.c, nmk16.c, powerins.c, quizpani.c, toaplan2.c, machine\nmk112.c/h.) [Osso].
       - 0.136              : Fabio Priuli converted the NMK112 to be a device and updated drivers using it accordingly.
       - 0.99u4             : Created new NMK112 ROM banking module and connected it up to a number of drivers that made use of it. Affected games are in cave.c, nmk16.c, powerins.c, quizpani.c and toaplan2.c [Alex W. Jackson].
       -  7th July      2005: Alex W. Jackson - As promised, here's my NMK112 unification patch. This patch affects the following games which use the NMK112 chip (including clones, unless noted): cave.c: donpachi and pwrinst2; nmk16.c: macross2, tdragon2, raphero (theoretically - driver doesn't have sound yet), bjtwin, nouryoku and sabotenb; powerins.c: powerina (not powerins); quizpani.c: quizpani (thanks Reip) and toaplan2.c: batrider and battleg. This is my first non-trivial code contribution to MAME, not to mention my first time writing C code in quite a while (VB and Python have made my brain mushy) so a real MAMEDev should probably look over the patch carefully to make sure I haven't done anything stupid. In particular, I don't understand exactly what the ACCESSING_LSB macro does--I just copied it from the old code in nmk16.c. I also don't know if I have correctly named the function NMK112_okibank_word_w(). Only the LSB of the data written is actually used (the data is ANDed with 0xFF and then passed to the 8-bit handler), so perhaps it should be called NMK112_okibank_lsb_w() instead. If any games output incorrect samples after using this patch, they may need to have NMK112_set_paged_table() called in their driver initialization. Determine which of the two M6295s is playing the wrong samples, and add NMK112_set_paged_table(chipnum, 0) to the game's DRIVER_INIT. See Donpachi for an example. Judging by the old code I replaced, I don't believe any games other than Donpachi require this (there was a comment in cave.c implying that Donpachi was an unusual case), but I may be mistaken. The interface to the NMK112 used by the two Raizing games in toaplan2.c can probably be tidied up, but I left it as it was since I don't have either of those romsets to test. In this patch I also took the liberty of fixing an apparent mistake in raphero's sound ROM loading, in case someone gets the sound emulation working in the future.
       - NOTES: NMK112 custom IC for bankswitching the sample ROMs of a pair of OKI6295 ADPCM chips. The address space of each OKI6295 is divided into four banks, each one independently controlled. The sample table at the beginning of the address space may be divided in four pages as well, banked together with the sample data. This allows each of the four voices on the chip to play a sample from a different bank at the same time.

      - 0.144u7: David Haywood and R. Belmont added libjpeg (JPEG image encoding, decoding and transcoding). Converted Sliver to decompress pictures on the fly.
      - 18th January 2012: David Haywood - I decided to integrate some proper JPEG decoding libraries into MAME. Why? Well, there is one game, which has been running in MAME for a while which actually uses JPEG decoder chips on the PCB. This game is the rather obscure 'Sliver'. As a game, it's not even remotely interesting, or good, but from a hardware perspective the pair of Zoran chips used to decode the JPEG images stored in the ROMs make it an interesting case. Until recently MAME has simply loaded an extra 'fake' rom with the JPEG images pre-decoded, and used a look-up table in the driver to convert the addresses requested by the game for the JPEGS into addresses where our pre-decoded bitmaps were stored. Obviously this isn't how the hardware worked. By integrating the JPEG library I've managed to remove the fake ROM, and can now point the decoder directly at the real JPEG data in roms as and when it's requested by the game. Note, you can see ugly JPEG artifacting on the game screen, they obviously didn't compress the images with very high quality settings. From an end-users perspective, the game still runs and plays exactly how it did before, but from a MAME perspective the emulation is now better, and we have a JPEG library to play with if we want it, maybe as an option when creating screen-shots at high resolutions where PNG becomes excessively large? Either way, it's there and could be put to further use. There is one other game which uses the same JPEG decoder chips on the board Magic the Gathering: Armageddon (Progettoemma link due to MAWS being down after it was used to hack MameWorld). Currently that game doesn't work, but Phil Bennett was last seen getting some 3D out of it, so having a JPEG decoder should help him get the correct textures, which are encoded as JPEGs in the ROM. As with the FLAC stuff, thanks also goes to R. Belmont for ensuring it compiles / works on Linux and Mac environments.

       - NOTES: The SEI0100BU YM3931 is not a Yamaha chip (!). It is the main/sub cpu interface, similar to Konami's K054986A or Taito's TC0140SYT. It also provides the Z80 memory map and interrupt control.
       - GAMES: Tad - Cabal (1988), Blood Bros. (1990), Raiden (Seibu 1990), Dead Angle (1988)
       - PCB: SEI0100BU YM3931 9106 EANA (Sdgndmps), SEI0100BU YM3931 9149 EALA (Sdgndmrb), SEI0100BU YM3931 9203 EAFA (Heatbrl), YM3931 SEI0100BU  DIP64 (Skysmash)

       Seibu CRTC
       - 0.153  : Updated Seibu CRTC to use DEVCB2 [Osso].
       - 0.149u1: Changed video\sei_crtc.c and includes\sei_crtc.h to video\seibu_crtc.c/h. Realized that Seibu SPI still uses their CRTC chip, updated Seibu CRTC. Some extra Seibu CRTC values (video\seibu_crtc.c). Death to sei_crtc dummy device and state-ized Sengoku Mahjong and Good E Jong video functions. Converted Seibu CRTC to a proper device. Hooked Seibu CRTC to D-Con and Blood Bros. hardware. Hooked up Seibu CRTC to clone Raiden (set 3) and raiden2 driver. Seibu CRTC really loved to PAL-ize those addresses. Some minor changes [Angelo Salese]. Seibuspi CRTC notes [hap].
       - 0.146u5: Fixed an horizontal scrolling bug in Sengoku Mahjong (drivers\legionna.c, sengokmj.c and video\sei_crtc.c) [Angelo Salese].
       - 0.141u4: Use a named memory area instead of either generic spriteram or a state-specific spriteram to allow sei_crtc.c to find the spriteram for games that use it [Aaron Giles].
       - 0.129u2: Added video\sei_crtc.c and includes\sei_crtc.h. Removed video\goodejan.c and sengokmj.c. Seibu CRTC [Angelo Salese]: Merged Sengoku Mahjong & Good e Jong video HWs. Added correct scrolling functions for Sengoku Mahjong. Removed some positioning kludges in both drivers.
       - NOTES: Seibu Custom "CRT Controller"
       - DRIVERS: bloodbro.cpp, dcon.cpp, goodejan.cpp, goodejan.cpp, legionna.cpp, raiden.cpp, seibuspi.cpp, sengokmj.cpp and raiden2.cpp

       WIP:

       315-5124
       - 0.175  : Added basic C-Sync callback to 315-5124, based on Charles' hardware tests [Enik Land].
       - 0.166  : Minor changes to 315-5124 and fixed a regression that in theory could affect zoomed sprites in TMS9918 modes [Enik Land].
       - 0.164  : Let's not save the dynamic memory in video\315_5124.c for now, it causes some nasty crash issues and doesn't look like it will be fixed anytime soon [David Haywood].
       - 0.162  : Updated 315-5124 palette in TMS99x8 modes [nitrofurano].
       - 0.161  : Update 315-5124 palette. SMS and SG1000-Mark3 uses a different palette for modes 0 to 3. Besides the colour space got posterized into 4 levels (2 bits), that was "designed" from people that didn't care about using the closest colours, which results in a darker picture, and somehow different from what sg1000 mark1 and mark2 games displays. http://www.smspower.org/Development/Palette has more information about [nitrofurano].
       - 0.159  : (MESS) Improved the SMS code for the Light Phaser, by simplifying the routines and making them slightly faster (bus\sms_ctrl\lphaser.c and video\315_5124.c) [Enik Land].
       - 0.158  : (MESS) Misc sms/gamegear improvements [Enik Land]: Renamed the gear2gear port to EXT port, after reading the references in the official GG documents. Inverted Y1 pin signal bits: now high is 1 and low is 0. More complete Y1 behavior: goes low only for transparent pixels. Fixed color of column 0 when it doesn't completely entered in the active display. Improved behavior of sprite overflow, to not be flagged when VINT is active. The new Y1 pin behavior of the SMS VDP is based on Charles' findings and TMS9918 manual [Fabio Priuli].
       - 0.157  : Assorted changes and fixes to video\315_5124.c [Tafoid]. (MESS) Game Gear: Moved GG-SMS scaling from VDP file to the machine file; undone the specific X-Scroll timing introduced to fix Chicago Syndicate, for Game Gear, because it causes problems with the games Sonic Drift 1 and 2; reduced the amount of duplicated code in the VDP file [Enik Land]. NOTE: (MESS Game Gear units modded to output the image signal to a TV are able to show games using SMS compatibility mode in full screen, without scaling, while native GG games are displayed in a centered, smaller image, that is surrounded by bigger borders. Also, GG units that have the original LCD display replaced by another LCD display model (not just the back-light) also displays SMS compatibility games without scaling, and native games with borders. This suggests that the scaling isn't performed by the VDP and therefore motivated the moving of the scaling code in this commit [Fabio Priuli].
       - 0.156  : The Genesis VDP inherits the SMS vdp code so that it can run in SMS compatibility mode (a feature of the chip) not so that you can try and use it in both modes at the same time. Added an SMS VDP to Megaplay to use as the overlay, rather than abusing this feature of the Genesis VDP (video\315_5124.c) [David Haywood].
       - 0.155  : Use a simple array for SEGA 315-5124 CRAM. Fixes autosave issue found by Tafoid [Wilbert Pol]. Prevent VDP register 6 contents from being overwritten while a line is being drawn. Fixes title screen in (MESS) backtof3 (video\315_5124.c) [Enik Land, Wilbert Pol]. Added new member to save state [Wilbert Pol]. Fixed graphics glitch in (MESS) E-Swat attact mode on the smsj driver and some small cleanups. Small improvements to the latching of some registers. Fixes flicker in (MESS) Power Strike 2 (video\315_5124.c). Refactored sprite handling, fixes status bar on Tarzan for Gamegear. Removed m_collission_buffer member variable. Tweaked game gear timing to fix glitches in status bar of Chicago Syndicate for Gamegear. Disable (MESS) Gamegear SIO register when in ggsms mode. Fixed tilemap mirroring on sms1 VDP needed for Japanese version of Ys. Fixed BIOS support in the Gamegear driver. Fixed collisions when column #0 is disabled [Enik Land].
       - 0.154  : Improved 315-5124 CRAM writes. Fixes wrong colors on Sega logo for (MESS) robocop3 on Game Gear. Improvement to timing for calculating flags. Fixes random hangs in Game Gear roboterm and flickering in Game Gear evander. Several timing fixes: * Fixed flicker on Choplifter title screen by drawing the borders through timers. * Instead trigger NMI at end of the display, do it at end of top border (line 261 after start of active screen area). * Added a delay to NMI, to be later than HINT, as stated by Flubba's VDPTest readme. * Also based on VDPTest readme, change VINT and Sprite Overflow flags to be later than VCount change. * Delay a little the display callback, to fix the title scrolling of Road Rash (SMS game). * Fixed documentation of the scanline sections and change some timings to match. * Calculate initial VCount values, instead use of hardcoded values [Enik Land].
       - 0.153  : Improved 315-5124 X-Scroll register timing [Enik Land]. First attempt to use modern 315-5124 code for SMS games in MegaTech, exploiting the parent class of the MegaDrive VDP class. Please report regressions, if any [Fabio Priuli]. Converted 315-5124 to DEVCB2 [Osso].
       - 0.150  : Got rid of redundant read in 315-5124 [Oliver Stöneberg]. Prevent writing outside the m_selected_sprite array [Wilbert Pol]. Small 315-5124 simplification [Oliver Stöneberg].
       - 0.148u5: Changed hcount calculation to use screen timings and move it to the VDP (video\315_5124.c and mess\drivers\sms.c) [Enik Land]. Slightly consolidated save/restore in sms/gamegear, still not reliable (video\315_5124.c and machine\sms.c) [Fabio Priuli].
       - 0.148u3: Small improvements to the 315-5124 palettes [Enik Land].
       - 0.148u2: Improved triggering of 315-5124 IRQs [Enik Land].
       - 0.148u1: (MESS) Running eagles5 on the sms2kr driver. It apparently expects the irq to be cleared when explicitly disabling VINT irqs during VINT (video\315_5124.c) [Wilbert Pol].
       - 0.147u4: Fixed 315-5124 copy/paste error that caused FluBBa's "Offscreen Y, col" test to fail for the game gear VDP [Enik Land].
       - 0.144u5: Added video\315_5124.c/h. Updated Sega System E driver to use the implementation from src\emu\video\315_5124.c and modernized driver [Enik Land, Wilbert Pol].

       315-5179
       - 0.79u2: Dave Widel decode information for custom CPU used by Robo Wres 2001 (NEC D315-5179).

       315-5197
       -  6th May 2006: Charles MacDonald - I've been revisiting some older hardware research I did with a fresh viewpoint and have been examining video timings for several PCBs as well as other functions: Sega 315-5197 tilemap chip (System 16B, Outrun, X-Board): 400 pixels per scanline: 29 pixels from /HSYNC high to /BLANK high (left border), 321 pixels from /BLANK high to /BLANK low (active display), 18 pixels from /BLANK low to /HSYNC low (right border) and 32 pixels from /HSYNC low to /HSYNC high (horizontal sync. pulse). 262 scanlines per frame: 20 scanlines from /VSYNC high to /BLANK high (top border), 224 scanlines from /BLANK high to /BLANK low (active display), 14 scanlines from /BLANK low to /VSYNC low (bottom border) and 4 scanlines from /VSYNC low to /VSYNC high (vertical sync. pulse). Using 6.293780 MHz pixel clock, 60.05 frames per second. Of scanlines 0-223, /XINT follows /HSYNC on line 222. It goes low when /HSYNC goes low at the start of the horizontal sync. pulse at the end of line 222, and goes high when /HSYNC goes high at the start of the horizontal sync. pulse at the end of line 223. It is asserted for exactly one scanline (400 pixels).

       315-5248
       - 0.136u3: Fabio Priuli converted Sega 315-5248, 315-5249 and 315-5250 custom ICs to be devices and updated drivers accordingly.

       315-5249
       - 0.136u3: Fabio Priuli converted Sega 315-5248, 315-5249 and 315-5250 custom ICs to be devices and updated drivers accordingly.

       315-5250
       - 0.136u3: Fabio Priuli converted Sega 315-5248, 315-5249 and 315-5250 custom ICs to be devices and updated drivers accordingly.
       - 25th January 2005: Aaron Giles - Spent some time this evening playing with the compare chip (315-5250) on my E-Swat board. This chip is present on several System 16B boards as well as on the X-board systems, and is used for doing simple 16-bit compares between values. Well, at least it looks simple at the start. For the most part, the implementation I currently have works fine, but it's not good enough to get the remaining few protected Golden Axe sets working. The symptom is that your player is stuck near the top of the screen.

       315-5292
       -  6th May 2006: Charles MacDonald - I've been revisiting some older hardware research I did with a fresh viewpoint and have been examining video timings for several PCBs as well as other functions: Sega 315-5292 tilemap chip (System 24, Model 1): 656 pixels per scanline: 69 pixels from /HSYNC high to /BLANK high (left border), 496 pixels from /BLANK high to /BLANK low (active display), 43 pixels from /BLANK low to /HSYNC low (right border) and 48 pixels from /HSYNC low to /HSYNC high (horizontal sync. pulse). 424 scanlines per frame: 25 scanlines from /VSYNC high to /BLANK high (top border), 384 scanlines from /BLANK high to /BLANK low (active display), 11 scanlines from /BLANK low to /VSYNC low (bottom border) and 4 scanlines from /VSYNC low to /VSYNC high (vertical sync. pulse). Using 16 MHz pixel clock, 57.52 frames per second. Setting $270001.b = $01 selects an invalid 512-scanline screen mode (same horizontal timings) where the display is enabled during the vertical sync. pulse and blanked at the wrong time. Maybe it's an unimplemented feature or used for chip testing, but it's definitely not useful. However it prevents framebuffer autoerase from working properly, so you can draw as many sprites as you want and keep the old ones.

       315-5296
       - 0.185: Read inputs through 315-5296 (drivers\segas24.cpp and segaybd.cpp). Use 315-5296 for I/O in segajw.cpp. Hook up 315-5296 I/O on srallyc drive board (does nothing yet)Added 315-5296 to segam1.cpp and some placeholder RAM areas. Use Sega 315-5296 device for primary I/O in segas32.cpp [AJR].
       - 0.157: Assorted changes and fixes to machine\315_5296.c [Tafoid].

       315-5313
       - 0.162: Fixed some 315-5313 save states pointers, fixes palette restore problem evident in (MESS) MegaDrive gauntlt4.
       - 0.157: Assorted changes and fixes to video\315_5313.c [Tafoid].
       - 0.156: mp_soni2 was trashing so much memory I'm surprised MAME didn't become self aware. Still haven't figured out what causes mp_gslam to trash part of the screen since we started using the real SMS code for the overlay, nor have I fixed the SMS mixing in interlace mode (soni2) or the incorrect horizontal offset (all games) that were also introduced at that time (video\315_5313.c) [David Haywood].
       - 0.153: Changed machine\megavdp.c/h to video\315_5313.c/h. Renamed Genesis VDP to Sega 315-5313 and moved it to emu\video\. Separation of the 32x from Megadrive VDP. (MESS) megavdp: Simplified DMA 'lag' handling, reducing the need of global functions [Fabio Priuli].
       - 0.151: Fixed VDP scanline settings in machine\megadriv.c (MT05293) [Oliver Stöneberg].
       -  1st June 2008: Charles MacDonald - Here is a mostly complete pinout for the 315-5313 VDP: http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/txt/vdppin.txt . If anyone does something cool like sticking a RAMDAC chip on the color bus outputs, do let me know.

       - 0.158: Added machine\315-5838_317-0229_comp.c/h. Moved Decathlete protection in a device, moved the Dead or Alive protection sim there too, added devices to driver (preparation for refactoring, they're the same device, just underused by Dead or Alive). Start using callbacks for Decathlete style decompression (start of refactoring). Refactored Decathlete protection a bit, hook up 'doa' to the table uploads for it too [David Haywood].

       - 0.158: Updates to SEGA's 315-5881 encryption based on new findings from Virtua Striker 2 '98 (Model3). Two new key bits for SEGA's 315-5881 encryption (machine\315-5881_crypt.c). Key scheduling simplifications. Partial reverse enginnering of the use of security PIC labels within 315-5881 keys [Andreas Naive]. Some changes to the 315-5881 to allow basic multiple stream support, Astra SuperStars needs this - we were ignoring a size value in the header, when the 'size' is reached the stream ends, and a new header needs to be read. I need to review the changes w/regards the NAOMI code later (don't have the material to test here) also this will need looking at w/regards compressed streams, as they can be mixed. The data decrypted from astrass is now a 100% match for the data that was extracted from the Saturn version. Let's maintain the '315-5881- keys in 'machine\315-5881_helper.c' until the key format is finalized as things stand the entire set of keys is of arbitrary bit order / poliarity / number of bits and just based on how our implementation works, storing them in files just means a lot of files have to be regenerated each time our understanding changes. I've left placeholder ROM_LOADs (with invalid crc/sha1s, compiled out) for placing the keys back once the format IS final. The list in 315-5881_helper.c needs updating / syncing with current knowledge, would appreciate somebody doing this. I'm going to see if I can see where / how the chip hooks up on Model 2 and Model 3, and if we can pass those checks with our current code. Fixed decompression case for Tecmo World Cup '98 title screen (machine\315-5881_crypt.c). Prepare Model2 for 315-5881 [David Haywood]. Added 315-5881 labels & sort [MetalliC].
       - 22nd January 2015: David Haywood - If you've been following recent news / various GIT commits then you might have noticed that we recent connected the dots between the encryption/compression schemes used on Naomi carts and those used on other Sega systems (ST-V, Model 2, Model 3) etc. In many cases these were used as a simple protection (especially on Model 2 / 3 and Radiant Silvergun in STV) just writing some values, reading them back and comparing them against a string in the code (which is very easy to bypass) but the reality is that there is a chip performing rather complex decompression and decryption operations on the data written in order to get that result, and in some cases it was actually used properly! It was discovered by ANY and others that many of these boards used a 315-5881 chip, we'd long suspected it could be the same scheme, but had never actually managed to make a firm connection. Software to extract data for analysis from a Naomi board already exists, and it turned out that by transplanting one of the chips from an ST-V cartridge onto a Naomi board we could use the existing extraction code and obtain a key thus confirming the chips were exactly the same thing just programmed with different keys. The encryption implementation, as it turned out, was missing some important details, features that none of the Naomi games really used (multiple encrypted/compressed blocks in a stream with mid-stream headers, non-power of 2 sizes for compressed data etc.) furthermore our encryption implementation was incomplete, so Andreas needed to further study the data and fill in some gaps. I poked around with the multiple block side of things a little, and eventually we've ended up with this previously both these graphics (the Tecmo logo and entire title screen) were displayed as garbage because they're both compressed and encrypted. I do wonder if there aren't still some flaws (the Tecmo logo looks rather rough) but it could be right (see next statement), and the title screen definitely looks fine. An interesting fact is that the game also checks a few values in the decompressed Tecmo logo and if they don't match the expected return values then the game breaks in various ways, for example the ball / player movement. If you're curious, the Tecmo logo is a single compressed stream with one block of compressed data. The title screen is a single stream with 4 blocks of compressed data (one for each quarter of the screen). Performance still isn't great here (it's a high resolution ST-V game, and our video rendering code is slow). Astra Super Stars also benefited from this, previously we were handling the HUD layer by loading the HUD data from the Sega Saturn version as a fake 'ROM' file in the romset, with the decryption hooked up I was able to remove the fake rom, the resultant data from the decryption process is identical so there's no visible change, just the knowledge that we're no longer depending on data that wasn't on the PCB. Astra Superstars was a bit of odd one really, for some reason the chip marked '315-5881 317-5040-COM' was actually used by 3 games (the other 2 being 'Shin Nihon Pro Wrestling Toukon Retsuden 4 Arcade Edition' and 'World Kicks') meaning we already had a key from the previous work on Naomi. Note, while this will help a number of ST-V games once we get the correct keys it WILL NOT help Decathlete because Decathlete uses an entirely different chip. My next plan is to hook this up to Model 2 / Model 3 in MAME, it won't really improve the MAME driver, but if we can extract / brute force an encryption key for Dirt Devils it should allow the SuperModel devs to fix the 2D layer (see here) if they decide to update the emulator again.
       - 0.156: Added machine\315-5881_crypt.c/h. Moved 315-5881 based encryption to it's own file, allowing me to experiment with the device for the encrypted ST-V games [David Haywood].

       TC0030CMD (C-Chip)
       - 0.188              : Added machine\taitocchip.cpp/h. Removed machine\cchip.cpp/h. Created C-Chip device with correct CPU type in it and a bunch of notes (pinout etc.). Added missing NO_DUMP definitions to various games using C-Chips with correct size etc. Pump Mega Blast through the device code as really all it ever does is bank the C-Chip window and test the RAM. Load CAPS0ff C-Chip dumps for Operation Wolf and clones, checksum on MASK rom part passes, but game specific EPROM is still bad for the time being. Added small note about what's wrong with the C-Chip EPROM dump [David Haywood]. Put C-Chip stuff in Type X driver [Vas Crabb]. Hooked up the four 'asic ram' shared bytes/semaphores/command registers between external cpu and the C-Chip and got rid of the 'return 0x01' hack for Mega Blast [Lord Nightmare].
       - 0.176              : Fixed all the Operation Wolf gameplay problems by improving the C-Chip protection simulation. Gameplay should be a true 100% match to original now. Put extensive notes in the machine file about what has changed: Fixed bug in 68K->C-Chip simulation that could lead to level 2 boss not appearing after first run [Bryan McPhail].
       - 0.174              : Added machine\cchip.h. Allow separate Taito X driver building. Fake header till C-Chip is converted to device [Miodrag Milanovic].
       - 0.155              : Silvio Grazini added clone Bonze Adventure (World, prototype). Note: Need to verify Z80 rom as the same (was missing from romset provided) also should check to make sure it uses c-chip in the same way as final. Fixed rom names.
       - 0.150              : Changed includes\cchip.h to includes\taito_x.h. Moved the Superman C-Chip implementation in the driver state [Osso].
       -  2nd November  2010: Smitdogg - We got Bonze Adventure so we can decap the C-Chip.
       - 11th July 2010     : Dr. Decapitator - Work has started on the C-Chip that Taito used in games such as Bonze Adventure and Operation Wolf. You can see some photos of a C-Chip on Guru's page.
       -  6th July      2010: Guru - One of the Taito C-Chips has been decapped. This is quite an interesting chip. Inside is a Z80 CPU, an 8k DRAM (NEC D4464A) and 8k EPROM (NEC D27C64). Games that use C-Chips include Bonze Adventure, Operation Wolf, Volfied, Mega Blast and Rainbow Islands. We have all of the C-Chips from those games except Rainbow Islands (which we're still looking for).
       - 0.118u4            : Stephane Humbert slightly changed the C-Chip emulation for 'Superman' to behave in a similar way as other Taito games. Changed 'Unknown' dipswitches to 'Unused'.
       - 0.118u3            : Stephane Humbert cleaned up several Taito drivers to use common input port macros. Fixed the dipwitches for all games (a few still remain unknown though) and added many notes. Improved the C-Chip emulation for "Operation Wolf" and its clones so it can now handle multiple coinage settings.
       - 0.104u3            : Alex Jackson removed MDRV_MACHINE_INIT(cchip1) from games that don't have a C-Chip (all of them except Superman). Fixed coinage in clone (Japan). Changed 'Unknown' dipswitches to 'Unused'.
       - 0.97u1             : Bryan McPhail added proper C-Chip emulation to Operation Wolf.
       - 0.96u2             : Bryan McPhail improved C-Chip simulation in Volfied to accurate timing and correct colour data for all levels.
       - 0.59               : Robert Gallagher and Tormod Tjaberg fixed Rainbow Islands and Rainbow Islands (Extra) C-Chip emulation. Changed (set 1) to clone 'Rainbow Islands (old version)' and (set 2) to parent 'Rainbow Islands (new version)'. Renamed (rainbow) to (rainbowo) and (rainbowa) to (rainbow).
       - 14th February  2002: Robert Gallagher improved the C-Chip emulation in Rainbow Islands and Rainbow Islands Extra.
       - 0.57               : Improved C-Chip simulation in Bonze Adventure [Stefan Jokisch, Ruben Panossian].
       - 24th November  2001: Stefan Jokisch resubmitted an improvement to the C-Chip emulation for Bonze Adventure.
       -  2nd September 2001: Stefan Jokisch improved the C-Chip emulation in Bonze Adventure.
       - 0.37b16            : Stefan Jokisch added 'Volfied (Japan)' (Taito 1989). Known issues: Color information for the enemy sprites is missing (C-Chip). Some bits in video RAM are not understood. Sound seems a bit rough at times.
       -  5th June      2001: Stefan Jokisch sent in a driver for Volfied, which has incorrect sprite colors for enemy sprites due to the C-Chip protection, but the game is otherwise playable.
       - 0.37b11            : Better fixes to Rainbow C-Chip, the secret rooms now work and display the correct secret codes [Stefan Jokisch]. Changed palettesize from 2048 to 8192 colors.
       -  7th December  2000: David Graves updated the Rainbow Islands driver to work a bit better and added better C-Chip emulation done by Stefan Jokisch.
       - 0.37b10            : Stefan Jokisch improved C-Chip simulation in Rainbow Island, fixing secret rooms.
       - 27th November  2000: Stefan Jokisch submitted a fix for Rainbow Islands secret room bug caused by incomplete C-Chip simulation.
       - 0.35b12            : Mike Coates makes Rainbow Islands playable (using the C-Chip dump from Jumping).
       - 21st April     1999: Mike Coates emulated Rainbow Island's C-Chip more correctly.
       - 0.34b8             : Added machine\cchip.c.
       - 0.34b6             : Howie Cohen and Brad Oliver added Superman (Taito 1988). Note: According to Richard Bush, the C-Chip is an encrypted Z80 which communicates with the main board as a protection feature. In Superman, it's main purpose is to handle player inputs and coins and pass commands along to the sound chip. The 68k queries the c-chip, which passes back $100 bytes of 68k code which are then executed in RAM. To get around this, we hack in our own code to communicate with the sound board, since we are familiar with the interface as it's used in Rastan and Super Space Invaders '91. TODO: Fix y-scrolling glitch (visible on part 2 of Round 1). Investigate "COIN ERROR" at end of Round 3 (Las Vegas) C-Chip. Optimize rendering. Does high score save work consistently?
       - NOTES: TC0030CMD is a custom Z80 with embedded 8K ram + 8k rom . This Controller or "Command Chip" communicates with the main board as a protection feature. In Superman, the C-Chip's main purpose is to handle player inputs and coins and pass commands along to the sound chip. In Mega Blast, the C-Chip will simply used as RAM, the game doesn't even bother to change banks.

       - 0.187              : Made TC0040IOC its own device type and separated its functionality from TC0220IOC [AJR].
       - NOTES: Taito's first custom I/O interface TC0040IOC differs a bit from its successors, being a 64-pin DIP with an address port and a data port. Besides digital inputs, coin-related outputs and an integrated watchdog, this chip also handles steering wheel and trackball input conversion in various games (not emulated here yet).

       - 0.149u1            : Added video\tc0100scn.c/h. Modernized the TC0100SCN video device. Split up the video devices contained in taitoic.c [Osso]. Let's actually initialize things in TC0100SCN to 0. Having uninitialized stuff anywhere is bad. Old 'C' devices would clear everything automatically, new 'C++' ones will not, you must do it manually. This appears to help with the missing layers issue (video\taitoic.c) [David Haywood].
       - 0.125u2            : Phil Bennett fixed black pixel patches present in the TC0100SCN fg layer of Under Fire and Ground Effects.

- 0.169              : Re-write S2636 from scratch as needed for Sub Hunter: Needs raw screen parameters and calls from scanline timer to work properly. Collision and completion bits generated correctly including duplicates. Supports background and score display. Generates audio tone from line frequency. Probably hurts performance when rendering per frame. Try to fix S2636 offsets in games using legacy screen params. Added drawing optimisation. Added INTREQ/INTACK to S2636, not used by any drivers yet [Vas Crabb].

- 0.135u4            : Fabio Priuli fixed all sets in drivers using S2636 video chip.
- 0.135u3            : Fabio Priuli converted Signetics 2636 video chip to be a MAME device and updated drivers using it accordingly.
- 14th August    2008: Tomasz Slanina - The best implementation of s2636 i've found so far is part of the MESS vc4000 driver. I'll try to "borrow" some code and test. But the main problem remains - how to emulate 3 chips at the same time? Uhh .in fact it's easy to emulate them, like other drivers does, just no interaction / communication between them. In fact they are "chained" somehow. According to datasheet there's possibility for use of mutliple PVIs. But no details. Also the game Galaxia reads external I/O port (instead memory mapped to PVIs )to check ship - enemies collisions.
- 0.126u5            : Tomasz Slanina fixed ROM mapping and added preliminary video emulation to Galaxia.

- 0.152              : Added Atari 2600 NTSC palette notes [Robert Tuccitto].
- 0.151              : Per "Television Interface Adapter [TIA]" tech doc and "Atari VCS POP Field Service Manual" in harmony with original hardware results, updated NTSC palette to better simulate colors on a CRT display. Documented phase shifts 24.7 thru 27.7 degrees in 0.5 increments. Enabled 26.2 degrees as default being a logical choice as the system should be initially calibrated for Hue 1x and 15x (F$) to visual match (~25.7 degrees) displaying 'gold'/'goldenrod' via system's manual pot adjustment, while moderate system runtime automatically creates a higher phase shift. Results collaborate with additional tech docs (I.E. "Stella Programmer's Guide") placing 1x as 'gold', 2x as 'orange' and 15x (F$) as 'light orange' (hue between 1x and 2x). Colors measured from midpoint of brightness scale [Robert Tuccitto].

- 0.152              : Device-ified asic65.c [Osso].
- 0.141u3            : Atari Ace removed unneeded #include lines in asic65.c.
- 0.128u2            : Atari Ace added missing const/statics, added/removed entries in header files, and fixed a few potential multisession issues by explicitly adding initializers. asic65.c has significant changes to accomodate using a struct instead of 16 variables, otherwise the changes are modest and obvious.
- 0.77               : Aaron Giles improved ASIC65 logic for Road Riot 4WD - almost playable. Added support for Guardians of the Hood.
- 0.62               : Added machine\asic65.h.
- 0.59               : Added machine\asic65.c.
-  6th February  2002: Aaron Giles added the missing ASIC65 source file.
- NOTES: The ASICs are used to speed up the simulation, so they likely perform complex math operations or graphics operations.
- NOTES: Road Riot 4WD (1991): (Aaron Giles) The core hardware is pretty similar to Hydra, but the emulation suffers from the lack of understanding of a custom ASIC on the board. Apparently this ASIC is used for complex math operations, and improper emulation of it leads to incorrectly drawn roads and crashes. It is likely this game also uses a SLOOP (son-of-slapstik) chip for protection. The sound board is a standard Atari 6502, YM2151 and ADPCM board.
       - Guardians of the 'Hood (1992): (Aaron Giles) Runs on the same hardware as Road Riot 4WD, but seems to have a much simpler chip in place of the custom ASIC. On the other hand, it is still unplayable due to a lack of understanding of the SLOOP protection chip.
       - The Namco System II board is a 5 ( only 4 are emulated ) CPU system. The complete system consists of two boards: CPU + GRAPHICS. It contains a large number of custom ASICs to perform graphics operations, there is no documentation available for these parts.

- 0.154              : Converted NES PPU to use inline config and removed some unused config values [Fabio Priuli].
- 0.153              : Hacked around the limitations of our PPU code (video\ppu2c0x.c), so to support the different (MESS) NES CHR registers. Improved PRG-RAM handling. First attempt to added split screen mode, still broken. The hack only deals with the way MMC-5 monitors PPU activity, not with the actual effect. When i get to the point of completing my not-yet-abandoned PPU rewrite, the new calls in ppu2c0x.h will go away [Fabio Priuli].
- 0.149u1            : Fixed array out-of-bounds access in ppu2c0x_device::draw_sprites() [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.148u3            : Made PPU use delegates instead of callbacks and PPU NMI also delegate and now inline config. Did latch delegate for PPU [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.145u7            : Wilbert Pol removed some leftovers in PPU2C0x from the conversion to a modern device.
- 0.144u7            : Converted NES PPU to be a modern device [Fabio Priuli].
- 0.137u3            : Alex Jackson removed the bogus 2C0X PPU "color remap tables" in favor of external palettes containing data reverse-engineered (several years ago) from original hardware. Each vsnes set, as well as the playch10 bios, now requires one of these palettes.
- 0.137u2            : Fabio Priuli added save states to NES PPU and performed some minor cleanups.
- 0.133u2            : More NES work [Robert Bohms]: Fixed bug in nes_apu that caused errors reading $4015. Added length counter status bits to $4015. Fixed 4-screen mirroring (PPU regression). Fixed cham24. Improved Sprite Overflow emulation of NES PPU (this fixes the first of blargg's Sprite Overflow tests).
- 0.133u1            : Rewrite of NES PPU [Robert Bohms]: Ported ppu2c0x to use a device memory map. Ported all rendering to access PPU address space through memory map. Updated MAME drivers to install read handlers or memory banks in PPU memory map, as appropriate. Removed all mirroring and banking code from the ppu, as the backing memory is documented to be external. Supplied replacement banking alternatives for all MAME drivers (vsnes.c, playch10.c, cham24.c and multigam.c).
- 0.130u4            : Nathan Woods changed the PPU2C0x implementation to be a device.

- 0.108u1            : Added video\ppu2c0x.c/h. Major cleanup/rewrite of the NES PPU rendering code [Brad Oliver]. This should improve the accuracy of the NES-based games (playch10.c and vsnes.c). Report anything odd or broken at MAMETesters.
- 0.104u5            : Nathan Woods changed the NES PPU interfaces to follow new struct conventions.
- 0.102u3            : Rob Bohms fixed $4014 sprite DMA in NES PPU.
- 0.97u2             : Andrew Church fixed NES PPU video timing.

G2.42  Nintendo Super NES Video/Sound

- 0.186              : Added wrappers for SNES PPU operations so members can be made protected [Vas Crabb]. Fixed obvious bugs found by GCC 7.1 (video\snes_ppu.cpp) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.174              : Moved around STAT78 PAL variable (video\snes_ppu.cpp and machine\snes.cpp) [Angelo Salese].
- 0.159              : (MESS) Converted input code to use slot devices. This means that you now change the emulated controllers (Joypad, Mouse, Multitap, Super Scope) via the Slot Device menu of the UI interface and not anymore from the System Configurations menu. Also, changing controller now requires to reset the system, so please take some time to choose the desired controller *before* starting the game, if you want to play a game that uses special controllers. Fixed Mouse emulation so that it does not jump back erratically if you keep moving beyond the window border. Fixed Multitap Adapter emulation so games properly recognize the device and inputs from all 5 controllers are accepted by the games. Added emulation of the Pachinko controller used by a few pachinko games for Super Famicom. Added emulation of the Yonezawa Twin Tap controllers, which allow to play with up to 8 players a quiz games for Super Famicom. Added emulation of the Epoch Barcode Battler unit (even if only as Super Famicom controller, and not as a standalone unit) which is necessary to play Conveni Wars Barcode Battler Senki for Super Famicom [Fabio Priuli].

- 0.155              : Added a few more members to SNES save state and initialized some unintialized members (video\snes_ppu.c and machine\snes.c) [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.154              : Changed video\snes.c video\snes_ppu.c. Added video\snes_ppu.h. Converted SNES PPU to be a device [Fabio Priuli]. Fixed usage of uninitialized members in snes_ppu_device [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.149              : Timers from the base state class should be still considered by the derived class (includes\snes.h). Modernized the SNES sound device (audio\snes_snd.c/h) [Fabio Priuli].
- 0.148u5            : Minor cleanup machine\snes.c used by NSS and other SNES-based arcade drivers. Added save registration of a bunch of scanline-related variables (video\snes.c) [Fabio Priuli].
- 0.148u4            : Miodrag Milanovic fixed snesb regression (includes\snes.h and machine\snes.c). Removed not needed state variables (includes\snes.h).
- 0.147              : Moved snes_oam in the state machine, allows to be showable in the debugger (video\snes.c and includes\snes.h). Fixed vertical sprite wrap-around in SNES driver. State-ized CG RAM and snes_vram. Fixed SNES VRAM size. Bunch of SNES changes (machine\snes.c/snes_w_io) [Angelo Salese].
- 0.141u3            : Fabio Priuli fixed save state error (snes_snd.c).
-  7th April     2010: Angelo Salese - I'm currently improving again stuff in the Super NES driver. Right now, I have a major task to do: Implement the master cycle "steals" that the devices does on that HW. Starting by the simplest one (the DMA) it starts to give reasonable results, The Smurfs - Travel the World, Mario Paint, Pachio Kun Special 2 and Super Cup Soccer all boots and Libble Rabble, Major Title and Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss have working inputs. Probably something regressed for now, but we'll do death count once that all of this is correctly implemented...
- 0.137u1            : Added audio\snes_snd.c/h. Removed audio\snes.c. Fabio Priuli reworked SNES OAM drawing routines. Implemented correct range over and time over flags (sprite limits) and FirstSprite priority. Moving more variables to driver data class and refactoring/cleaning up some code. Updated SNES sound device to use device handlers, to store its internals in a struct, and to save them. Added some SNES internal refactoring, some new debug functions, a small mode7 fix. Updated SNES DSP1, DSP2, DSP3, DSP4, OBC1, SRTC and ST010 addon chips to store their variables in struct and to save them. Added proper sprite priorities. Added pseudo-hires effect. Changed 'SNES Custom' sound to 'SNES Custom DSP (SPC700)'. Added save states to the SPC700 core.
- 0.137              : Fabio Priuli simplified the SNES drawing routines, added support for offset-per-tile, cleaned up the code, fixed remaining issues in hires modes, fixed serial joystick reads and slightly simplified palette handling. Added very preliminary driver_data class for SNES based drivers (it only contains input-related items for the moment, because these are needed to add support for additional controller types in MESS). Fixed scrolling problems. Refactored joypad inputs to be consistent with other input devices (used in MESS). jbo_85 fixed Offset-per-tile graphics. jbo_85 and Fabio Priuli fixed OAM overflow.
- 0.136u4            : Minor SNES refactorization. Temporarily reverted implementation of mult/div through timers since it breaks some SNES games on the MESS side [Fabio Priuli].
- 0.136u3            : SNES WIP [Fabio Priuli]: Added a couple of registers to snes_ppu struct. Moved color blending (background & subscreen color addition/subtraction) at the end of the drawing process. Removed some unused (and not working anymore) debug code. Fixed the remaining debug functionalities. Moved colour struct to be another layer (simplifying some code). Updated hires blending to work with two pixel at time. Fixed clipmasks with hires modes.
- 0.136              : Hardware multiplication and division on the SNES takes 8 machine cycles to complete [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.135u4            : Fabio Priuli moved SNES timer allocation to MACHINE_START.
- 0.134u1            : Angelo Salese fixed SNES CG ram reading address and an incorrectly SNES setted DMA register read, fixes DMA Memory in the test cartridge. Changed region user6 to addons.
- 0.134              : Added machine\snesdsp3.c, snesdsp4.c/h. ZSNES Team and Fabio Priuli added emulation for the SNES DSP-3 and DSP-4 add-on chips, based on latest ZSNES.
- 0.133u5            : Added machine\snesrtc.c and snessdd1.c. SNES updates [R. Belmont, Harmony]: Corrected ROM loading behavior for SuperFX games. Added more ROM mirroring needed by certain SuperFX 2 games. Corrected the behavior of certain bit-restricted SuperFX registers. Doom, Yoshi's Island, Dirt Trax FX and Voxel Demo show things now. Improved S-DD1 emulation, neither game using S-DD1 boots yet. SuperFX updates [Harmony]: Inlined a number of functions for possible speed increase. Removed some memory buffering cruft, to be re-added later. Fixed behavior of ASR opcode. With additional MESS-side changes, Stunt Race FX is playable, and Vortex shows much more. Hooked up RAM and ROM buffering. Inlined several more functions. Removed debug spew. Added the ability to define an external IRQ line callback, and hooked it up to the 65C816. Fixed flag calculation for HIB opcode. Hooked SuperFX chip up to the SNES machine driver. Fixed carry handling in ADC, ADCI, SBC and SBCI opcodes. Fixes many SNES SuperFX bugs. Made numerous corrections to SNES S-DD1 chip emulation, SFA2 and Star Ocean still do not boot. SuperFX updates [Anonymous]: Fixed disassembly of LMULT/FMULT ops. Fixed reads using LDW/LDB. Fixed writes using STW/STB. Fixed SBC carry behavior. Fixed GETC ROM access behavior. Some SuperFX games begin to show things in MESS. At least partly fixed PLOT and RPIX behavior. This fixes many gfxs in Star Fox and Vortex, but no polys yet.
- 0.133u4            : SNES improvements [Angelo Salese]: Fixed half colour blending behaviour.
- 0.133u3            : SNES Updates [Angelo Salese]: Fixed direct color gfxs in mode 7. Fixed direct color gfxs in mode 3/4. Fixed a vram out-of-bounds bug. Fixed a blending bug involving main/sub color maths. Fixed interlace mode gfxs when not in gfx modes 5/6. Fixed a GDMA boundary bug. Made the OAM address reset more accurate. Fixed HDMA mid-frame inits. Added clip colors to black window function. Converted color clipping to use struct entries. Made dynamic H resolutions to be called only at vblank start and fixed gfx mode switching 1/5 and 5/1. Made the gfx mode switches more accurate. Corrected a bunch of SPC registers behaviour. Improved joypad read/write handling and fixed a serial port quirk. Fixed serial port for player 2 as well. Improved cart mode 20 reserved access behaviour. Added OBJ interlace support.
- 0.133u2            : SNES video updates [Fabio Priuli]: Re-enabled video debug functionalities in debug build (to toggle background layers). Added proper priority tables for various bg/obj layers. Largely simplified tile and line drawing routines, and fixed small bits here and there. Further simplification of tile drawing routines. Added palette index to 8bpp tiles (correct color_shift still unsure, though). Reworked video drawing routine to simplify the various graphic mode drawing and to allow proper implementation of priority orders (especially bg3 priority bit and mode 7 priority order). Improved mode 7 extbg (still missing mosaic). Added some more debugging options. Improved Mode 7 math precision (but still some issues remain) and added a few elements to PPU struct. Implemented Mosaic in Mode 7. Merged OAM functions. Added a few elements to PPU struct (this might be handy if we ever come to convert SNES PPU to a device). Fixed Mode 7 shared scrolling/matrix registers. Slightly optimized Mode 7 math (by using Anomie's recursive formula). Moved some more register contents to PPU struct. Added PPU1/PPU2 Open Bus support, STAT77/STAT78 registers should be more accurate (even if still not perfect). Simplified window masking code and moved some more regs to PPU struct.
- 0.133              : Several MESS-specific SNES fixes for rendering [Angelo Salese].
- 0.129u4            : Changed Custom sound to SNES Custom.

Fabio Priuli and BYUU added emulation for SNES special chips DSP-2 & OBC-1: Added sources snesdsp2.c & snesobc1.c. Removed special chips detection from MAME. Modified memory handlers to account for the new chips.
- 0.127u6            : Fabio Priuli changed the NSS/SNES loading code to support more cart/memory layouts and generally be more in line with the MESS way of handling SNES cartridges. Also some minor NSS/SNES cleanups.

G2.6   Blitter
- 13th April     2005: Aaron Giles - Picking up from my last article on blitters, the next thing I was going to talk about was how to time a blitter. At a rough guess, if you have schematics handy, you can look at a blitter chip and do an approximation of how long a blit will take. A blitter chip, like a CPU, needs a clock, so that's a good starting point. For example, the blitter on the classic Williams games (Joust, Robotron, etc) runs at 4MHz. That means it's going to be limited to 4 million operations in a second. But you can go beyond that. If you look at the width of the data bus that the blitter has, then you can tell how many bits it can operate on at a time. The Williams blitters have a 4-bit bus, and there are two of them running in parallel, so that's 8 bits per operation, or 2 4-bit pixels. Taking the guessing game one step further, if there is only one address bus on the chip (as is the case for the Williams blitters), then it can't read graphics data from the source and write to a target at the same time. In fact, it will need to constantly swap back and forth between the source address and the destination address. So, assuming that it takes one clock to read a source byte, one clock to swap to the target address, one clock to write a target byte, and one clock to swap back to the source address, you're looking at 4 clocks per operation. So, putting all this together, I'd have a first guesstimate that the Williams blitter could handle (4000000 clocks / 4 clocks per operation) * (8 bits per operation / 8 bits per byte) = 1 million bytes per second, give or take. So that's the ballpark to expect. I'm currently working on an update to the early Williams games that will factor this in, in the hopes that Robotron might slow down enough to match the arcade (a number of folks have noticed that Robotron runs too fast in MAME at the higher levels). Of course, the ideal situation would be if we could measure this directly. Unfortunately with the Williams games, there's no obvious way to do it because the blitter HALTs the main CPU while the blit is happening, in order to gain full control over the systemwide address and data busses. If I had an oscilloscope and a PCB to play with, I could probably do some measurements that way. But there's no obvious software path to do it. (Okay, I lied, there is one: I could program the sound CPU to measure the timing, and then send start/stop signals to the sound CPU just before/after the blit is done. That might be worth trying). Fortunately, most later hardware that used blitters decided that it didn't really make sense to suspend the main CPU while a blit was happening, so they were designed to operate in parallel with the main CPU. These are generally known as an "asynchronous blitters". The Incredible Technologies blitters are like this. The nice thing is that this setup makes it relatively straightforward to measure how long blits of different sizes take to complete. Having done this now for the 8-bit IT games, I'll describe the gory details in my next blitter-related post.
-  6th April     2005: Aaron Giles - A number of games I've done drivers for (Williams, Strata, Art & Magic, etc) use blitters as their way of drawing graphics on the screen. This is different from the way most arcade games work, and is actually much more similar to a modern computer. In these games (and in computers), there is a large chunk of video memory which is called the "frame buffer". The frame buffer contains 'n' bits of information for each pixel you see on the screen. Now, one immediate problem you run into with a frame buffer is that there is some hardware that is constantly scanning through this memory and pushing that data to the screen. If you are in the middle of modifying a bunch of pixels and the scanner intersects the area you are drawing to, then you can produce an effect called "tearing", where a partially rendered object is displayed (this is a simplification, but it illustrates the general idea). To get around this, most blitter-based games have two frame buffers. At any given time, one of the frame buffers is actively being scanned and displayed to the screen, while drawing happens to the other frame buffer. After the beam has scanned to the bottom of the display, the two buffers are swapped. This is known as "page flipping". The early Williams games didn't have enough video RAM to do page flipping, so they had to be very aware of what scanline was currently being displayed. Once the scanning beam had passed below the area of video RAM they wanted to animate, then they could make their changes without fear of tearing. This is generally referred to as "drawing behind the beam". So where does a blitter come into play? Well, in general it was entirely possible to sit there and muck about with the frame buffer using the main CPU. In fact, Defender doesn't have a blitter at all - it is all drawn by the main CPU. The problem is that it takes a lot of CPU power to draw lots of pixels on the screen. And although a CPU can certainly accomplish a lot, it is not specifically designed for drawing lots of pixels at high speeds. One solution to this could be to add a second CPU that is responsible for drawing the graphics, based on commands from the first CPU. In fact, a number of games such as Gyruss and the Cinematronics/Leland games (Quarterback, Ataxx, Super Off Road, etc) do just that. However, a CPU is an expensive part. And it's not optimized for doing graphics. So a number of folks caught onto the idea of designing custom ICs that were dedicated to performing very fast graphics operations. In general, it's not enough to just draw pixels, these chips also had to do a lot of bit manipulation and address computations to handle things like X and Y flipping, transparency, scaling, etc. The term that has come up over time to describe this kind of operation (copying large arrays of data and manipulating them during the copy) is a "blit". And custom chips that are dedicated to this sort of work are called blitters. So, you can think of a blitter as a custom chip that is designed to copy graphics (which are normally stored in ROM or RAM) to a frame buffer while manipulating the data in a programmed fashion. So what makes this tricky in MAME? Well, first off, every company designed their own blitter. There is no standard way of blitting. Generally, this just takes some reverse engineering power and a lot of patience to figure out what's happening. The really tricky part is the fact that blitters don't perform their operations instantaneously - it takes some time to actually shuffle through all that data and render it to the frame buffer. As a simplification, most blitters in MAME are implemented as "instantaneous" blitters, meaning they complete instantly. The problem is that many games rely on the speed of the blitter to limit their speed, or else overtax the blitter so that the original game slowed down when too much was being drawn at one time. Figuring out how fast the blitters operated is the trick, and I'll talk more about that next time.
- 0.95u2             : Aaron Giles rewrote blitter implementation to be much simpler (no more macros) and measured and implemented accurate blitter timing (fixes some speed problems).

- 0.147u1            : Fixed 256 colour SVGA modes when used by the gfxultra. Just renaming a few functions in gfxultra (video\pc_vga.c and isa_vga_ati.c). Made logerror output from 8514/A related functions optional (video\pc_vga.c). Bit more function renaming and variable shuffling. Moved 8514/A specific functions and variables to the ATI device, as the Mach8 is properly 8514/A compatible, and made the S3 device derived from the ATI device (instead of vice versa). Moved 8514/A and Mach8 implementations to separate devices. Fixed uninitialised structs causing issues with SVGA and 8514/A devices in debug builds [Barry Rodewald]. Used read8_delegate instead of read8_space_func for vga port read (drivers\calchase.c, gamtor.c, magtouch.c, midqslvr.c, pangofun.c, pcat_dyn.c, pcat_nit.c, photoply.c, pntnpuzl.c, queen.c, savquest.c, su2000.c, taitowlf.c, voyager.c and xtom3d.c). Made Cirrus SVGA card just another VGA implementation, and removed a need for additional parameter (drivers\calchase.c, gammagic.c, gamtor.c, magtouch.c, midqslvr.c, pangofun.c, pcat_dyn.c, pcat_nit.c, photoply.c, pntnpuzl.c, queen.c, savquest.c, su2000.c, taitowlf.c, voyager.c, xtom3d.c and indiana.c). Removed need for pc_vga_io_init also made accessors for linear access to VGA memory needed for some models. Some cleanup (video\pc_vga.c). Converted VGA to be multiple devices, this will require some cleanup in future. Moved structs to classes [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.147              : Fixed potentially uninitialized variable when building with MSVC. Fixed compiling with MSVC, code was probably wrong (video\pc_vga.c) [smf]. Added IBM VGA card [Carl]. Added preliminary ATi Graphics Ultra support. Added extended bits for display start and cursor start. Expanded cursor_start to UINT32 to accomodate (gfxultra). Fixed video memory paging (video\pc_vga.c). Fixed for blank screen after starting MS-DOS Editor or QBasic (gfxultra). Very basic implementation of the linedraw register, enough to pass the BIOS' test (gfxultra) [Barry Rodewald].

- 0.145u1            : Fully rewritten VGA gc registers from scratch. Various changes, preliminary implementation of RGB888 (still not working, at all). Fixed vram size, fixed regression with at486 (MESS) and makes Alien Breed (MESS) vertical scrolling to work properly. Latched pel shift register in VGA mode for Alien Breed, H scrolling is still jerky for some reason. Added crtc protection mechanism. First batch of CRTC clean-up. Changed ET4K file name & ISA name properly. Nuked crtc.data array from standard VGA functions. Preliminary hook-up for proper vblank calculation [Angelo Salese].

- 0.144u7            : Fixed VGA and VGA Double Scan / Maximum Scan Lines condition, and removed a bunch of kludges. First attempt at adding proper VGA refresh rates [Angelo Salese]. Some VGA cleanup and refactoring and exposing read/write handlers of pc_vga [Miodrag Milanovic]. Fixed VGA video [Judge]. Support for CGA emulation for VGA [Angelo Salese]. Fixed CGA port find regression [Miodrag Milanovic]. Avoid a freeze when the VGA crtc is not initialized faster than light [O. Galibert]. Fixed pc_vga start address in text mode [Barry Rodewald]. Major overhaul of VGA memory handlers, added monochrome emulation and fixed text banking while at it [Angelo Salese]. Tseng Labs VESA support [Angelo Salese]. Fixed VGA memory map writes [Grull Osgo].
- 0.144u6            : Angelo Salese fixed a bug with VGA mask line compare.
- 0.142u5            : Removed emu\video\pc_video.c/h.

G3.8   SVGA

- 0.172              : Fixed potential crash when svga_s3 hardware pointer is at the edge of VRAM, and fixed viewport scrolling in Red Hat Linux / XF86_S3 [Barry Rodewald]. Make post text screen work with Trident VGA (isa\trident.cpp). Added support for doubled horiz width in TVGA9000 [Carl].
- 0.162              : Added non-writable area if VRAM bank is set past the end of available VRAM on the S3 Trio64 and Virge. S3 BIOSes will now correctly probe RAM size and store it in the strapping registers [Barry Rodewald].
- 0.161              : Added a bit more to the Cirrus SVGA extensions. Made a start on the Cirrus hardware pointer, fixed reading of the lock register (Touchstar Bonanza works again). Splitted Cirrus video devices to separate files (VGA, SVGA, GD5428 and GD5430). Cirrus WIP, Virtual Pool VESA and non-accel GD54xx drivers are playable. Made Cirrus ISA cards 16-bit, rather than 8-bit. Fixing some possible crashes, BitBLT destinations, fixing some errors in handling VGA CRTC registers and found using MFGTST [Barry Rodewald].
- 0.156              : Moved bus\pci\cirrus.c/h to bus\lpci\. Changed Trident ISA device to be 16-bit, which is likely more correct. Map Trident memory clock, video clock and LUTDAC registers [Barry Rodewald]. Added zero() to (s)vga_device: zeroes all private variables but vtbls. The vga.memory is resized to 0. svga_device::zero() does it all [Juergen Buchmueller]. Updated comments/TODOs about invalid vptr warnings (build\flags_clang.mak, bus\isa\s3virge.c, trident.c and video\pc_vga.c). Use vga_device::zero() in cirrus_vga_device::device_start() as well (video\pc_vga.c) [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.155              : Added isa\trident.c/h and isa\svga_trident.c/h. Added hookup for Trident TGUI9680 video card. Fixed Mach32 and Mach64 crash when reading vblank state [Barry Rodewald]. Added video card BIOSes: S3 9503-62 (not working), Elsa Winner 1000/T2D, S3 ViRGE BIOS v1.00-10 and ATi mach64V1 113-34404-104 [rfka01, Barry Rodewald]. Added CLKSYN test register (SR17), gets stock Trio64V2/DX BIOS to boot (video\pc_vga.c). Changed 'Trident VGA' to 'Trident TGUI9680' and moved device into its own source file. Added ID register, banking and clock selection (isa\trident.c). Added Trident DAC command register, so that we can tell when in a 15 or 16 bit mode. Forced Trident doubleword offset when using an SVGA video mode, fixes display in Eggs Playing Chicken. Some Trident WIP, added CRTC offset bit 8 and start address bits 16-18. Extended 3d8/3d9/CR0E new mode SVGA bank size. BIOS now detects 2MB VRAM (but WIN95 is still clueless). Fixed Trident busy bit, added logging of 2D acceleration registers. Implemented basic bitblt and bresenham line functions. Added mono bitmaps generated by writing to VRAM. Added 2D acceleration support for 15/16/32bpp video modes to Trident (untested since XFree86 3.3 requires linear addressing, which in turn requires VLB or PCI support). Improved mono pattern drawing in Trident, fixing foreground colour, adding background colour and clipping it. Added Trident XOR drawing, added XNEG and YNEG reverse directions for mono pattern BitBLT. Improved Trident Bresenham line drawing, it now at least draws in the right direction. Added hardware cursor. Added programmable clock, previous clock select was for TGUI9440CXi and TVGA cards, still lacks a divisor for higher refresh rates, but up to 70Hz modes should be correct now. Hopefully found the clock divider bit used by the BIOS, refresh rates should now be pretty correct. Fixed programmable clock selection when running XFree86. Reworked Bresenham line drawing. It's better, but I'm still not convinced it's completely accurate. Trident MMIO WIP. To test with Win95, set the card ID to 0xe3 [Barry Rodewald].
- 0.154              : Added bus\isa\mach32.c/h. Set s3 and s3virge power-on strapping bits on reset, and allow them to be written (if unlocked). Prevent writing past the end of VRAM, should fix XF86_SVGA crashing (cirrus_vga_device mem_r/w). Added preliminary ATi Graphics Ultra Pro (Mach32) ISA video card [Barry Rodewald]. Added Diamond Stealth 3D 2000 Pro card [Malice, Barry Rodewald]. Added ATI mach64 ISA card [Barry Rodewald].
- 0.153              : Moved mess\video\isa_svga_s3.c/h to bus\isa\svga_s3.c/h, mess\video\s3virge.c/h to bus\isa\s3virge.c/h and mess\video\cirrus.c/h to bus\pci\. Corrected Trio64 video clock setting, based on datasheet. Corrected S3 ViRGE dot clock calculation to match the Trio. Corrected svga_s3 ID values, based on S3ID. Added derived s3virgedx device so that the Virge/DX can return the correct ID bytes. Also cleaned up clock calculation a bit. Added configuration registers for Trio/Virge chipsets. Are read-only for now. Added S3 "colour mode 8" to the Trio, corrected divisor for 32bpp modes [Barry Rodewald].
- 0.148u5            : Made VGA offset calculation an overridable method, instead of a macro. Fixes display in XF86_S3. Added a little bit to svga_dm, but still needs a lot of work [Barry Rodewald].
- 0.148u4            : Setting the Mix to DST actually does draw pixels. Fixes background rendering in XF86_S3 (video\pc_vga.c). Added read/write registers, and implemented read masking in BitBLTs (used by XF86_S3). Made clipping rectangle checks against Destination X/Y when doing BitBLT (s3, mach8: video\pc_vga.c, isa_svga_s3.c, isa_vga_ati.c and s3virge.c). Added MMIO registers for read and write masks (s3: video\pc_vga.c). Added bits 8 and 9 of VGA Offset register (s3, s3virge: video\pc_vga.c and s3virge.c) [Barry Rodewald].
- 0.148u3            : Added video\s3virge.c/h. Made S3 ID registers read from member variables. Added S3 ViRGE video card. Made a start at fixing up some of the S3 ViRGE VESA video modes. Moved s3virge to separate source file [Barry Rodewald].
- 0.148u2            : Just a few minor updates to svga_s3 (video\pc_vga.c) [Barry Rodewald].
- 0.148              : A bunch of MMIO hooks for S3 card, used on Win 95 16-bit color mode. Fixed HW cursor color in RGB16 mode [Angelo Salese].
- 0.147u3            : Added S3 SVGA extra bits for Horizontal/Vertical VGA registers, re-enabled dot clock selection, and fixed it up a bit. 800x600x16bit in X11 is now usable (but still not correct) [Barry Rodewald].
- 0.147u2            : Corrected S3 SVGA rendering of 15/16/32-bit colour modes. This allows X11 to display correctly in high-colour. It's still not perfect, however, but 640x480x64k works fine. Commented out dot S3 SVGA clock selection for now, as it caused issues with WIN95 [Barry Rodewald].
- 0.147u1            : Added extra extended start address and banking registers to S3 SVGA. Bit more function renaming and variable shuffling. Moved 8514/A and Mach8 implementations to separate devices. Fixed uninitialised structs causing issues with SVGA and 8514/A devices in debug builds [Barry Rodewald].
- 0.147              : Added mess\video\cirrus.c/h, isa_svga_cirrus.c/h and isa_svga_tseng.c/h. Converted svga_s3 to 16-bit ISA device. The S3 chipsets have 16-bit wide registers, and can only be used on AT systems. Preliminary work on S3 764. Added support for S3 SVGA WAIT bit on rectangle drawing, fixed rectangle width and height. Added bitblt function. Minor fixes relating to S3 SVGA text drawn at negative coordinates. Fixed S3 SVGA rectangle wait drawing to work under DirectX 5. Implemented S3 SVGA background and foreground mix registers. Fixed text rendering when full acceleration is set in WIN95. Implemented S3 SVGA pattern fills, fixed some BG/FG mix functions, fixed a bug when drawing wait rectangles in reverse direction. Added memory-mapped I/O ports, and various other updates. Made co-ordinates always relative to the start of VRAM. This fixes Virtual Pool using accelerated S3 video drivers. Added basic support for Bresenham lines. Added S3 SVGA Hardware Graphics Cursor. Works fine under Windows 95, allowing hardware acceleration to be set to full, but doesn't work right under Windows 3.1. Added vector line drawing and short stroke vectors (svga_s3/gfxultra) [Barry Rodewald]. Merge of MESS sources [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.145u1            : Some SVGA specific fixes [Angelo Salese]: Hooked up dummy functions for S3 SVGA card. First batch of S3 SVGA support. Added RGB16 for S3 video card, used by Grand Theft Auto title screen. Kaylee added basic wrapper for Diamond Multimedia (Cirrus Logic based) ISA SVGA.

- 0.162              : Added system-to-video BitBLTs and fixed up patterned BitBLTs. Fixed shadowed variables. Fixed BitBLTs being short by one scanline, and correct colours used when using both patterns and colour expansion together. Added reverse direction BitBLTs, and improved colour-expanded pattern handling (still not quite perfect, though). Added transparency support, fixed some lockup issues with colour expanded system-to-VRAM BitBLTs. Fixed background and foreground colours in XFree86, which does not enable extended writes that the manuals say enable the extra bits in GR0/GR1 [Barry Rodewald].
- 0.161              : Added video\clgd542x.c/h. Splitted Cirrus Logic SVGA video devices into separate files. No differences between them yet, other than chip ID. Cirrus WIP, Virtual Pool VESA and non-accel GD54xx drivers are playable. Added generic GD542x ISA card (GD5428 and GD5430). Hardware cursor is working, but other acceleration features still need a lot of work. Made a start at implementing extended write modes 4 and 5 [Barry Rodewald].

- 0.120u3            : Aaron Giles expanded polynew.c to support quad rendering. Converted midvunit.c over to using the new quad rendering, which fixes a number of rendering issues that have plagued the driver since the start. Added Z-clipping logic to polynew.c. Converted namcos22 over to using that code. Simplified namcos22 significantly, working in quads throughout the lower-level pipeline and then handing the results off to polynew.c. Updated model3.c to use the new poly code, and changed much of the low-level implementation to make things easier.
- 0.120u1            : Aaron Giles created new module polynew.c which combines triangle setup, rasterization and Voodoo-like multiprocessor support.

- 0.141u2            : Alex Jackson replaced anonymous timers used in video\segaic16.c, drivers\segaorun.c and drivers\segaxbd.c with allocated timers, making it possible to add save state support to these drivers.
- 0.139u2            : Treat unsupported read and write accesses (segaic16.c) to defined devices/memory as open-bus reads or unmapped writes instead of falling through to the memory-mapping registers [Phil Bennett].
- 0.138u2            : Atari Ace added some missing static qualifiers to MAME. Also, renamed some generically named exports from segaic16.c.
- 0.129u5            : Atari Ace fixed crash/freeze while starting games using segaic16.
- 0.128u6            : Atari Ace fixed the widely used segaic16 video core to no longer reference the global Machine.
- 22nd March     2005: There were several problems with Line of Fire. Particular that game, all of which are interesting, and none of which had anything to do with the CPU interleaving that I originally thought was the source of my troubles. In the end, it mostly came down to the divide chip. As I mentioned previously, the game will sometimes attempt to divide by zero. Now, the divide chip has flags to let you know that you've caused an error, but the game never reads them. It would then take the result of the divide-by-zero, look it up in a table, and use the resulting value in future calculations. The problem is that the table was only ~32 entries long, so when I tried returning 32767 as the result of a divide by zero, it read some random ROM location and used that instead of a valid value. To work around this, I am guessing that divide by zero either returns 0 or 1. I'll have to work with Charles to figure the exact details out. But all that served to fix was the fast/slow/fast/slow speed at which you moved through the level, and which eventually ended up hanging the game. Once that was all better, the game would hang right near the end of the first level. At least that part was consistent. First, though, I had to fix the jittery sprites. I was pretty sure there was no way this game would be that poorly done (though at the same time I think the Sega fanboys make a few too many assumptions that Sega would never have graphics glitches in their games). I first started guessing that the divide chip actually didn't do a full 32-bit by 16-bit divide, but rather maybe a 24-bit by 16-bit divide, or some other reduced accuracy version. This actually produced smoother results, but it screwed up a lot of other stuff too. Eventually I noticed that the value 0x8000 was being used as the divisor quite often, while at other times it was using values in the 0x7f00 range. If I treat those values as signed 16-bit values, then the 0x8000 would suddenly flip from +32000 to -32000, which seemed kind of odd. So I tried going back to a full 32-bit by 16-bit divide, but treating the values as unsigned, and suddenly things were much easier to look at. But back to the hang at the end of level 1. I eventually put a trace on both the CPUs right near the end of the level, in order to see what was happening. It turned out that the main CPU would execute some code, then jump backwards into the middle of an instruction. This is a clear sign that something seriously bad was happening. On a hunch, I tried loading up the Japanese version of the game and looking at the equivalent code. Turns out one word in the World version ROM was wrong. But if the ROM dump was bad, then it wouldn't have passed the memory test in service mode. The only other logical explanation is that there must be a small error in the decryption key for the World version. Hopefully "The Doctor" will figure that out for me. Related to the divide chip issue was the bug that made GP Rider behave strangely. My original divide chip implementation had us recomputing the results every time the dividend or divisor was changed. But it turns out (and is actually pretty clear from the schematics, now that I've looked at them again) that the divide is actually explicitly triggered by writing to a higher address. The reason this was important for GP Rider is that they would trigger one divide, and then load the dividend for the next divide before reading the result of the previous divide. With my original code, writing the dividend for the second divide was trashing the results of the first divide.
- 0.94u5             : Aaron Giles fixed several divide chip behaviors (segaic16.c), fixing Line of Fire and GP Rider (divide by zero just returns the divisor (needs to be verified), mode 1 divides are unsigned and divides are only triggered by a write with A4 set).
- 0.94u2             : Aaron Giles implemented Y-board sprite priorities (not fully understood, but seems to work), found missing 8th bit in Outrun/X-board sprite pitch, implemented Outrun/X-board road priorities according to logic dump from Leopardcats, hooked up road RAM double buffering that was missing for Outrun/X-board and disabled direct scanline mode for Outrun road, which doesn't support it (video\segaic16.c). Changed divide-by-zero case to return a value (machine\segaic16.c).
- 0.91               : Aaron Giles added support for 3 multiply chips and 3 divide chips. Fixed timer/compare chip implementation to match real PCB (machine\segaic16). Added tilemap flipping support and sprite flipping support for 16A and 16B sprites (video\segaic16).
- 0.90u4             : Aaron Giles cleaned up tilemap handling using the new user_data feature. Added pixel-accurate scaling to System 16B sprites (video\segaic16.c). Based on this knowledge, tweaked Hang On, Space Harrier, and 16A sprite systems. Fixed documentation on Hang On/Space Harrier road chip.
- 0.90u1             : Aaron Giles unified all memory mapping code and moved it into machine\segaic16.c, unified all tilemap, sprite and road code and moved it into video\segaic16.c and improved documentation on the various register layouts on the video side. Note that in the process, I broke the title screen animation for Laser Ghost, and there is now a 1-pixel column error on ddcrew's attract mode. These are known issues that I will try to address soon.
- 0.89u5             : Aaron Giles cleaned up the math chip emulation (machine\segaic16.c), should be much closer now.
- 0.89u3             : Added machine\segaic16.c/h. Sega System16 updates [Aaron Giles]: Xreated new machine\segaic16.c to hold non-video common hardware. Preliminary multiply/compare implementation moved there. Changed segaic_init_palette to take a number of palette entries.

G4.23  Sega System32
-  5th July      2005: Aaron Giles - System 32 is certainly a curious beast, and one of the most intriguing parts of the system is the mixer chip. The mixer chip is the bit that takes input from 8 different video sources - 4 tilemap layers, one text layer, one bitmap layer, one background layer, and one sprite layer - and determines which layer is visible for each pixel. Beyond that, it is also responsible for looking up the palette entry of that pixel and generating the final RGB values for it. Along the way, it has the capability to adjust the RGB values and perform some blending, along with a host of other wacky functions. In short, it's a mess, and rather difficult to understand. When faced with these kinds of situations in arcade hardware, it's best to try and "be the ball" - think like a piece of hardware, understand its capabilities, its inputs, its outputs, its clock speed, and try to come up with limitations on its behavior that can help explain what's going on. For example. It's been known for a while that the System 32 mixer chip has an alpha blending feature. In order to perform alpha blending, you need to take the RGB values of one pixel, apply a multiplier, and add them to the RGB values of a second pixel, after applying the opposite multiplier. It's also been known that you can turn on alpha blending for each layer, so that, say, two of the background layers are both alpha blended with the pixels underneath them. Now, if that's the case, then you should in theory be able to turn on alpha blending for all 8 layers if you wanted. Ah, but wait. For each layer, in order to do alpha blending, you would have to know that layer's RGB values. How do you get the RGB values? Well, you have to look them up in palette RAM. Hmmmm. That's a memory access, which requires a clock to the RAM chips to fetch the data. If I had to do 8 palette RAM lookups, I would need to use 8 clocks to perform 8 separate reads from palette RAM. But the input clock to the mixer is not fast enough to cram 8 memory accesses into it, especially given the maximum speed rating on the palette RAM memory chips. In fact, one memory access seems to be the most we can reasonably expect to get per pixel. So how can we even do alpha blending at all? Well, looking at the board, palette RAM is 32k long, separated into two 16k banks. That's interesting. At the time the boards were produced, it was certainly possible to use larger RAM chips, so why did they use two banks of smaller chips instead of one bank of larger chips? Well, as it turns out, the busses for each bank of chips go to different parts of the mixer. So the mixer can apparently access separate entries in each half of palette RAM independently. Okay, but how does this look from a software point of view? Tests have verified that I can read and write independent values across all 32k of palette RAM. Ah, but I hadn't enabled alpha blending! If I turn that bit on in the mixer, some interesting magic happens: I can read the full 32k of palette RAM normally, but all writes I make get automatically mirrored to the opposite 16k chunk. Which means that if I enable blending in the mixer, and then fill the low 16k of palette RAM, the upper 16k will automatically be filled with an exact copy. This means that the mixer can look up two pixel indexes and get their RGB values at the same time, by looking one up in the lower 16k and the other in the upper 16k. So we now have an explanation for how we can get two palette lookups per pixel. How do we limit it to 2, given that each layer could result in an alpha blend? Well, thinking about things in the absence of alpha blending, the mixer needs to figure out which pixel is "on top" out of all the layers. Then it will look up the RGB value of that pixel and output the result. It makes sense, then, that for alpha blending, it would figure out not only which layer's pixel is "on top", but also which layer's pixel is the 2nd from the top. Then, if alpha blending is enabled for the "on top" pixel, the mixer can alpha blend between the topmost and 2nd-to-topmost pixel. This isn't perfect, because it is assuming that the 2nd-to-topmost layer didn't also have alpha blending enabled, but in practice, this is exactly what the hardware does. As a final point, it's actually even more complicated than this. Each layer specifies with a bitmask exactly which other layers it can alpha blend against. So when the mixer figures out which layer's pixel is on top, and which layer's pixel is 2nd-from-top, it then has to see if alpha blending is enabled between those two layers specifically. If it's not, then the topmost pixel is displayed normally; otherwise, the alpha blend takes place.
- NOTES: There are still MANY issues with the system 32 driver, mostly video related. The system use a 5-layer tilemap hardware consisting of 4 independant rom-based layers with linescroll, lineselection, linezoom and window clipping capability and one simpler ram-based text plane. Mixed ram/rom sprite engine with palette indirection, per-color priority (thankfully not actually used). The sprite list includes jumping and clipping capabilities, and advanced hot-spot positioning. The mixer chip adds totally dynamic priorities, alpha-blending of the tilemaps, per-component color control, and some other funnies we have not been able to decypher.

G4.24  Sega ST-V
- NOTES: The ultimate 2D system. Even more advanced tilemaps, with 6-dof roz support, alpha up to the wazoo and other niceties, known as the vdp2. Ths sprite engine, vdp1, allows for any 4-point streching of the sprites, actually giving polygonal 3D capabilities. Interestingly, the mixer capabilities took a hit, with no real per-sprite mixer priority, which could be considered annoying for a 2D system. It still allowed some beauties like Radiant Silvergun.

- 28th June      2005: smf - It took about half an hour to get Tenkomori Shooting up and running as there were alot more protection checks than other System 12 games. There were a couple of problems with the graphics though. I spent some more time studying the protection checks, which allowed me to remove all the rom patches from the games that previously required them. Unfortunately this didn't help and it hasn't got Soul Calibur or Tekken Tag any closer to being emulated either. I started looking closer to home and I discovered it was using a little known feature of the PSX, that allows you to flip sprites. None of the unofficial GPU docs mention it at all and Pete Bernert has only supported x flipping in his GPU plugins, no game had used y flipping until now. After adding x & y flipping it looks much better. I had to verify which was which as they were always setting both or none. So after verifying the sprite flipping bits on a console I sent the information to Pete to add to his renderers. The only issue now was the intro didn't look quite right. This took a while to track down, eventually I realised that they were dma'ing 1792 bytes at a time from the mdec output. Each block is 512 bytes, which makes 3 and a half blocks. The code in MAME & most other emulators can't cope with this. With a fix for this issue the intro looks great too. It's not over yet. Although Pete had added the y sprite flip to the GPU plugins, the game wouldn't even boot in ZiNc. It took alot of tracing and comparing to MAME, but I eventually found it. I had to retrofit the MDEC fix onto ZiNc's MDEC decoder as well.

- 0.164              : Added INLINE before ATTR_FORCE_INLINE (video\vooddefs.h). Converted rasterizer path to use rgbaint_t types. Switched to new reciplog function (video\vooddefs.h). Converted entire pixel pipe path to use rgbaint_t types (video\voodoo.c). Added define for turning off cycle eating during regiser reads [Ted Green].
- 0.163              : Added some custom RASTERIZER_ENTRY lines for Golden Tee Fore! series, seems to help with performance when lots of transparencies are used [David Haywood]. Re-organized macros into function calls to help in optimization identification (video\vooddefs.h). The old macros can still used by setting USE_OLD_RASTER to 1. Default to old rasters until new are verified. Made new functions use SSE2 implementation. Added immediate add and mult add functions (video\rgbgen.h). Added SSE2 implementation of immediate add and mult functions (video\rgbsse.h). Added comments for rasters (video\voodoo.c). Clean up rasters for gtfore. Fixed Voodoo compile for 32-bit. Small correction in genTexture (video\vooddefs.h). Separate direct fb write to help performance (video\voodoo.c). Stop trying to read from null pointers (video\vooddefs.h) [Ted Green].

Added different Voodoo card types and configuration options (video\voodoo_pci.c). Fixed voodoo_1 PCI initialization. Added pre-fetchable flag to BAR [Ted Green].
- 0.161              : Attempt to fix LFB pipelined pixel write in Voodoo and fixed fogmode lookup (video\voodoo.c and vooddefs.h) [Ted Green].
- 0.155              : Fixed Voodoo 3D graphics have no palette in hangplt and thrilld (video\vooddefs.h). Reverted r31185 in video\voodoo.c (Passing of attotime as const references). This fixed emulation hangs in gauntdl and gauntdl24 after initialization [Phil Bennett]. Added support for writes to trexInit1 register, to return TMU configuration data [Peter Ferrie].
- 0.154              : Fixed an edge case where CMDFIFO execution would get stuck if the first word in CMDFIFO buffer is written out of order [Ville Linde]. Fixed texture with alpha channel is not drawn properly in gauntdl, gauntdl24, gauntleg and gauntleg12. Fixed alpha test to run on the alpha combiner output and not on a_other. Do the test before the color combiner steps to potentially save some effort (video\vooddefs.h) [Phil Bennett]. Voodoo modernization. Fixed Viper driver regression (video\voodoo.c). Converted Voodoo to DEVCB2. Removed unused config struct [Miodrag Milanovic]. Fixed typo in Voodoo (video\vooddefs.h) [Aaron Stover].
- 0.148u4            : Voodoo is using now device callbacks and some minor cleanups in few drivers (video\voodoo.c/h, vooddefs.h, drivers\funkball.c, gticlub.c, hornet.c, magictg.c, nwk-tr.c, seattle.c, vegas.c and viper.c) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.148              : Added Voodoo3-specific targets for cmdfifo packet type 5 [Ville Linde].
- 0.147u1            : Fixed potential out of array access in src\emu\video\voodoo.c logerror() (MAME crash when try to read the voodoo region) [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.146u5            : Fixed build error, something about ui_show_mouse is declared void that I couldn't figure out but it's not needed anyway (video\voodoo.c) [Phill W.].
- 0.131u4            : Aaron Giles added new file devtempl.h which can be used to generate the DEVICE_GET_INFO function. Updated all the Namco I/O devices to use this, along with the 6821PIA and Voodoo.
- 0.128u6            : Voodoo devices now require a CPU to be defined in the configuration in order to know whom to steal cycles from or stall when FIFOs get full. Updated all voodoo users to specify one [Aaron Giles].
- 0.125u7            : Aaron Giles converted Voodoo into a proper device. Updated drivers accordingly. Added save state support to the Voodoo emulator. Fixed poor default CLUT handling in the Voodoo driver.
- 0.123u5            : Voodoo now takes a device_config for the screen [Zsolt Vasvari].
- 0.122u5            : Simplified Y-unit DMA rendering, fixing bugs and removing the macro voodoo [Aaron Giles].
- 0.121              : Atari Ace fixed bug in Voodoo statistics accumulation.
- 0.120u1            : Couriersud and Aaron Giles improved multiprocessor Voodoo performance by reducing contention during rendering. Extended the system to allow for more overlap between rendering and emulation.
- 0.120              : Aaron Giles made several more traditional optimizations to the voodoo emulations, gaining a few percent improvement.
- 0.119u4            : Aaron Giles updated Voodoo code to use the new work functions. It now queues small scanline chunks as independent items rather than using shared items. Updated code to also copy some parameters to allow for greater overlapping of emulation and rendering.
- 0.119u3            : Aaron Giles changed the 3dfx Voodoo emulation code to take advantage of the new threading mechanisms. It now creates a work queue with the WORK_QUEUE_FLAG_MULTI flag set, and uses shared work items to spread rasterization work across multiple processors. Note that this support should be considered experimental; under some circumstances it is known to deadlock. If you encounter problems, set OSDPROCESSORS to 1 to effectively produce the previous behavior. Added new work item flag WORK_ITEM_FLAG_SHARED. When specified on a work item that is queued to a work queue created with the WORK_QUEUE_FLAG_MULTI hint, it means that all threads will be dispatched to process the one work item, instead of the first thread removing it. These "shared" work items are only considered complete when all processing threads have returned [Aaron Giles].
- 0.119u1            : Aaron Giles fixed Voodoo video timing according to the manual, including blanking periods and vsync interrupts. This makes Carnevil and some other games run once again at their proper speed. Updated Voodoo drawing code to track changes to the front buffer and allow skipping unrendered frames for more even framerates.
- 0.114u2            : Ville Linde hooked up vblank interrupt to Voodoo in all Voodoo-based games.
- 0.113u3            : Aaron Giles fixed bug in voodoo emulation that caused improper framerates to be computed.
-  8th April     2007: Ville Linde - I fixed some multi-processor issues in the SHARC core, and some Voodoo-related issues in the NWK-TR/Hang Pilot graphics board emulation. As a result, Hang Pilot sprung to life in its whole 3D glory. There seems to be some texture problems still to be fixed though.
- 0.102u5            : More Voodoo updates [Aaron Giles]: Fixed overflow in Voodoo 1/W calculation that messed up some textures. Added missing color combine mode used by Gauntlet Dark Legacy.
- 0.102u4            : More Voodoo updates [Aaron Giles]: Fixed bug that trashed fbzMode when the fogMode was changed. Added preliminary Voodoo 2 support; Gauntlet Legends works again. Changed float-to-int conversion to be done manually.
- 0.102u3            : More Voodoo updates [Aaron Giles]: Added support for CLUT/gamma ramps; enables fade in/out effects. Changed stall callback to notify both start and end of stalling. Decreased bilinear resolution to 4 bits for Voodoo 1. Fixed statistics and added some new ones. Now properly masking off unsupported bits for earlier chipsets. Fixed NOP command so it doesn't always reset statistics. Fixed bug that caused the refresh rate to never be updated. Fixed 16-bit writes to the frame buffer. Fixed crashing bug after resetting the chip. Added support for Voodoo 2's new fog, colorpath and chromaRange modes. Added correct wrapping for ARGB, W and Z values. Fixed bug where depth was written to the Z buffer without bias. Now aggregates shorter commands to reduce the number of context switches.
-  4th December  2005: Aaron Giles - So I thought I had everything figured out. I found a nice depth buffer bug that fixes numerous problems in the Voodoo games (and which happened to be there in the old implementation as well). I figured out the weird alpha blending problem. And the only thing that was left was understanding why Carnevil was no longer rendering its polygons correctly relative to the background movie. I looked everywhere for the problem, and it turned out to be much more subtle than I realized. It turns out that a number of the games use the DMA functionality of the Galileo GT64010A chipset to send data to the Voodoo. This actually makes a lot of sense. The Voodoo has a limited size FIFO where the data goes in, and when that is full, whoever is sending the data has to stall until the Voodoo has had a chance to finish whatever it was backed up doing. Far better to let the DMA system stall than letting the main CPU stall when it could be doing real work. In the old implementation, I made all commands to the Voodoo complete instantly. This meant that any DMA transfer, no matter how long, finished instantaneously, even if it was rendering tons and tons of polygons or clearing the screen. In the new implementation, I changed the code to actually approximate the amount of time each polygon and screen clear takes. The problem with this is that DMAs no longer complete instantly, and this has revealed a subtle problem. Many of the games kick off a nice long DMA to the Voodoo and let it complete asynchronously while the main CPU is off busy doing other things. The problem is, there is code in most of the games that also directly accesses the Voodoo without checking to see if there is still a DMA in progress. When this happens, new commands were being inserted into the rendering queue at the wrong spot. The most obvious side effect was in Carnevil, where they would write a command in the middle of a DMA that turns off depth buffering, meaning that all subsequent triangles were rendered without doing any depth comparisons. The trick is figuring out what the behavior should be. I've tried hacking it so that if the CPU writes to the Voodoo while the DMA is in progress, then the CPU stalls until the DMA completes, and only then does the write go through. This works but introduces other glitches in the system. So now I have to come up with another theory.
- 0.102u2            : Added video\vooddefs.h. Removed vidhrdw\vooddraw.h, voodlfb.h, voodrast.h, voodregs.h, voodrgen.h and voodrx86.h. Rewrote the Voodoo emulation code to be more accurate to the original [Aaron Giles]: Support for multiple simultaneous boards (hello Silent Scope). Pixel-pipelined framebuffer accesses now work. Alpha buffer operations now supported. Triple buffering now supported. Proper memory allocation and handling based on configuration. Proper FIFO handling, including low/high water marks and stalling. Approximate timing calculations based on quoted fill rate specs. Detail textures implemented. All math is done in fixed point. Proper edges calculated for polygons (stars appear in Gradius 4 now). Much easier to add specific rasterizers now. This is a work in progress; some stuff is not quite right yet. Voodoo 2 emulation is completely broken.
- 28th November  2005: Aaron Giles - I've never been quite happy with how the Voodoo emulation code ended up. It's a pretty big system to emulate, and in order to get things working quickly, I took several shortcuts. I ignored a few features (detail textures, trilinear filtering, alpha buffers), simplified the math (using floating point, even though the original works in fixed point), cheated on the PCI interface (did not fully emulate the FIFOs), and faked the timing (completely ignored it, that is). This was expedient toward getting the first games up and running, but now it's time to go back and do it right. So I'm rewriting everything from scratch. Fortunately, I'm mostly done. I still have to add fogging, fix a few precision issues with far-away textures, and correct a few other glitches before it's ready. But the code is much simpler and better organized, and operates more closely to the original. Which brings up another point: I recently acquired a Voodoo 2 card for my "oldie" PC (thanks, Tim!), which I'm using to verify some of the behaviors. Although I won't claim perfect pixel accuracy, this new version should be much closer. The new Voodoo will be in time for 0.102u2, but Voodoo 2 emulation is completely busted at the moment and will have to be brought up to the new system afterwards. One step at a time...
- 0.102u1            : Aaron Giles fixed some minor problems with the LOD calculations in the Voodoo driver.
- 0.102              : Aaron Giles implemented pixel-accurate dithering in the Voodoo emulation.
- 0.101u5            : Added video\voodrx86.h and voodrgen.h. Aaron Giles added very experimental rasterizer generator for the Voodoo emulator, which generates X86 assembly blitters optimized for each case. Unfortunately, it doesn't help performance much and they are still too buggy so they are disabled for now. Enable them in the makefile. Made some of the hack optimizations runtime enableable in the Voodoo emulator, and added a frameskipper. Use Ctrl+1-6 to control frameskipping, Ctrl+F/H/Q to run at full/half/quarter resolution.
- 0.88               : Aaron Giles fixed Voodoo code broken by cleanup in 0.87u3.
- 0.84u2             : Added vidhrdw\vooddraw.h, voodlfb.h, voodrast.h and voodregs.h. Removed vidhrdw\voodblit.c. Aaron Giles refactored the Voodoo code, fixing several errors in the LOD calculations and the Voodoo 2 command FIFO.
- 0.82u2             : Aaron Giles cleaned up Voodoo logging. All stats now accessible via the backslash key. Got rid of ugly red/blue swap hack. Fixed missing truncation on vertex coordinates (fixes vaportrx graphics). Added support for alternate LFB write modes.
- 0.81u5             : Aaron Giles added full memory FIFO emulation. Removed hack for fastfill operations after a buffer swap. Added compile time option to reduce the resolution. Added client callbacks for VBLANK synchronization. Cleaned up handling of statistics and debugging info. Added optional R/B component swapping (for vaportrx). Dixed crashing problems when executing Midway POSTs. Now dynamically computing refresh rate based on hSync/vSync registers.
- 0.77u3             : Aaron Giles added code to clip the Voodoo vertexes to 1/16th of a pixel increments, fixed writes to the palette RAM on the Voodoo, fixed small errors in the Voodoo rendering when bilinear filtering and fixed handling of local alpha blending on the Voodoo.
-  5th December  2003: Aaron Giles - Turns out that California Speed revealed a few bugs in my 3dfx emulation. Bilinear filtering was adding too much error to allow for chroma keying, which is used a whole bunch. There was also a misunderstanding in how the "a_other" term was computed, which prevented all FMV sequences from displaying anything. And finally, this is the first game to use palettized 8-bit textures, and there was a bug in how the palettes were uploaded. The upshot is the game still crashes, but it looks much prettier along the way! I also spent a little bit of time looking at the Vegas sound system, which has some quirks of its own....

G4.62  Voodoo 2

- 0.187              : Extend PCI interrupt support to Voodoo 2 and above [Ted Green].
- 0.162              : Added different Voodoo card types and configuration options (video\voodoo_pci.c) [Ted Green].
- 0.146u3            : Fixed video dimensions register on Voodoo 2. Fixed the rest of the video timing registers to have one extra bit [Ville Linde].
- 21st December  2005: Aaron Giles - Been taking another look at the Vegas drivers again now that the Voodoo 2 emulation is working. Gauntlet Legends was working again in 0.102u4, which is a good sign. A couple more fixes and Gauntlet Dark Legacy was working again - at least as well as it had been before, which is to say fine until you actually got in-game, at which point all the environment graphics were drawn all-black. Looking into this problem a bit more revealed that the Dark Legacy engine had added light maps to the rendering, using a multiplication between two textures to produce the final result. The Voodoo rasterizers support this just fine, but what was new is that they were now using a new mode in the Voodoo 2 which specifically selects the texture color rather than a color computed through other means. Since this mode didn't exist in the original Voodoo, the code was just using '0' for this case and producing a black background. Adding support for this made the graphics appear. Yay!
- 0.102u4            : Aaron Giles added preliminary Voodoo 2 support; Gauntlet Legends works again.
- 0.84u2             : Aaron Giles refactored the Voodoo code, fixing several errors in the LOD calculations and the Voodoo 2 command FIFO.
- 0.78               : Aaron Giles added initial Voodoo 2 support. Removed hack to toss what I thought were bogus triangles. Improved W buffer handling. Improved accuracy of depth buffer handling.
- 19th December  2003: Wow, that was a tricky bug. Turns out nobody was ever saving the FPU condition codes in the R5000 core, so if you took an interrupt between a compare and a branch on the result of that compare, you would hose the compare. This led to all kinds of nasty. The graphics are still very glitchy (I took a bunch of screen shots and this was the best one), but we're seeing most of the geometry now. However, the glitches in most of the Seattle games are now gone as a result. I also fixed the W-buffering on the 3dfx emulation to be closer to what I think is correct. This fixes some minor glitches in a few of the Seattle games.
- 12th December  2003: Aaron Giles - Several of the Atari and Midway Vegas games are now booting. They look pretty. The Voodoo 2 emulation is mostly working for FMV and static screens, but it's falling over when actual geometry is being rendered. In addition, the games are kind of flaky at the moment, crashing MAME sometimes, and none of them work yet with the dynarec R5000 core. And finally, though Gauntlet: Dark Legacy and War: Final Assault work with the new ADSP-2104-based DCS sound core, the others fall over at the moment unless I help them along. So all in all, some exciting developments, but there's still quite a ways to go to get things stabilized.
-  9th December  2003: Aaron Giles - Well, after a frustrating night trying to get this to work, I'm finally getting somewhere with my Voodoo 2 emulation....

- 0.103u3            : Many Voodoo updates to add Voodoo Banshee and Voodoo 3 support [Aaron Giles].
- 16th January   2006: Aaron Giles - Took a decent amount of hacking, but I'm finally into the attract mode in NBA Showtime. The game crashes out pretty quickly and there are other problems, but at least now I can verify that the CHD dump is good (and it is).
- 27th December  2005: Aaron Giles - There's a part of me that wants to try and start on the Voodoo Banshee emulation, but I also really want to get the Voodoo 2 games working first. Plus, the Banshee requires a whole bunch more glue to support the 2D side of things, so that means faking VGA grossness. I only hope the games don't actually use the 2D stuff for anything except setting the display mode! Fortunately, the 3D section is pretty compatible with the Voodoo 2.

       - 0.123u6            : James Wallace converted the MPU4 driver to use an HD6845, as the Hitachi part was on the PCB, while also using it to generate the VBLANK, rather than hardcoding a value. Added the pulldown resistor to the network, and added all the conditional inputs. Please note that on the later Cabinet Types (Ready Steady Go-1 onwards), the 10p slot is locked out (location of the true register for this is unknown), but the input setting is correct - you have to use Coin 2 or higher to get money in. Zsolt Vasvari fixed screen != NULL assert.
       - 0.123u5            : Zsolt Vasvari changed the MC6845 to take and pass device_config's only. The following shook out from this that are applicable to other devices as well: Running_machine is no longer taken, passed or stored MC6845_t is now private. Since passing device_config's is not device type safe, I added a get_safe_token() to mc6845.c to check the device passed in for the valid type. Changed MC6845 to take a screen tag instead of a screen number. Fixed flickering in Electric Yo-Yo. Changed qix driver to use the MC6845's VSYNC notification for interrupts. Added some new 6845 varieties: MC6845-1, H46505, HD6845 and SY6545-1.

Converted HD63484 to use delegates. Added 8-bit mode. Converted sigmab52.c driver to use the new HD63484.
       - 0.151              : Removed not needed include in video\h63484.c [Osso].
       - 0.150              : Modernized HD63484. This should be merged with video\h63484.c [Osso].
       - 0.143u6            : Added video\h63484.c/h. Started rewriting of HD63484, using ADP driver as a starting base [Angelo Salese].
       -  7th February  2010: Roberto Zandona - Assuming that the memory map of the HD63484 (thanks to Dox and its notes in the driver sigmab52) is: 00000-3ffff = RAM, 40000-7ffff = ROM, 80000-bffff = unused and c0000-fffff = unused by offering access to videoram you see these screens: Skat TV, Fashion Gambler and Funny Land de Luxe.
       -  7th February  2010: Roberto Fresca - I started to write a driver for Sigma B52 system. This platform is a complex gaming system based on 2x M6809 CPU's, 1x YM3812 sound device, and a very complex video controller (H63484 ACRTC). Thanks to Tomasz Slanina that kindly joined efforts hooking the ACRTC stuff, and Fabio Priuli converting this controller to a device. The ACRTC implementation is a bit hacky due to its preliminary emulation state. Here are some snaps from Joker's Wild (B52) and a new game dumped by Team Europe: Treasure Island from Subsino. We're working with Angelo Salese and David Haywood to get it working.
       - 0.136u2            : Moved hd63484.c/h to emu\video. Fabio Priuli converted HD63484 ACRTC to be device.
       - 0.129u5            : Roberto Zandona impemented CRCL command in HD63484 (used in skattv test mode).
       - 0.129u4            : Phil Bennett added Read Parameter Register support to the hd63484. Moved logging behind a define.
       - 0.127u1            : HD63484 improvements [Roberto Zandona]: Fixed cpx and cpy when a ptn or a agcpy command is executed. Fixed for PTN command: copy direction and dot color. First implementation of PAINT command (for now only 4bpp and 8bpp supported and the pattern is not supported).
       - 0.127              : Roberto Zandona improved HD63484 core to support some initial graphics.
       - 0.126u5            : Added video\hd63484.c/h. Some improvements to shanghai video drivers [Roberto Zandona]: Convert framebuffer's ram from 8 bit to 16 bit. Convert DMA command from 8 bit to 16 bit. Convert gfx command from 8 bit to 16 bit. Implemented all gfx mode: 1,2,4,8,16 bpp. Now we can use this gfx chip for adp driver that use 4bpp.

       - 0.154              : Converted MC6845 to DEVCB2, delegates and inline configs. While at it, cleaned up the args of the mc6845 delegates as well (no need to pass back and forth pieces of the driver class, now that delegates belong to it as well). Even if I tested the changes extensively, I might have missed something among the 177 source files using this, so please report any regressions you see [Fabio Priuli]. Don't make visible area larger than screen size with SHOW_BORDER_AREA; it causes vblank duration to be negative, which is all kinds of weird and wrong (video\mc6845.c) [Alex Jackson].
       - 0.153              : Fixed total freeze of MESS when interlace&video mode was selected on super80v. Also added some comments [Robbbert].

Updated some MESS drivers to make use of this [Curt Coder].
       - 0.152              : Robbbert fixed vertical resolution increase in drivers using the MC6845 device.
       - 0.149u1            : Added rudimentary support for MC6845 'interlace and video' mode [jedwidz].
       - 0.148u2            : Fixed uninitialized variable and members and removed unused member in video\mc6845.c [Oliver Stöneberg].
       - 0.148u1            : Angelo Salese added a preliminary boolean flag to MC6845 interface structure: "show border area".

(MESS) Enabled Sharp X1 (drivers\x1.c) to show border area, fixes Shilver Ghost gameplay and Nobunaga no Yabou error display if a single floppy is in [Angelo Salese].
       - 0.148              : Stop spamming the MC6845 log file [Curt Coder].
       - 0.147              : (MESS) c128: Refactored to use the new VIC-IIe, and rewrote the MOS8563 VDC as an MC6845 variant. The VIC-IIe and VDC now have their own screens. Not fully working yet. Fixed MOS8563 attributes [Curt Coder].
       - 0.145u8            : Show errors with logerror instead of popmessage (video\mc6845.c) [hap].
       - 0.144u6            : Major bitmap-related changes throughout the system [Aaron Giles]. All video devices are now hard-coded to either ind16 or rgb32 bitmaps. The most notable in the MC6845 which is rgb32, and required changes to a number of consumers.
       - 0.143u2            : Added the AMS40041 variant (used in the Amstrad PC1512) to mc6845.c [Curt Coder].

       - 0.141u4            : Curt Coder implemented MC6845 row/column addressing mode.
       - 0.140u3            : Curt Coder added Synertek SY6845E subtype to mc6845.c.
       - 0.140              : Aaron Giles added new method reset_origin() to screen devices to allow manual synchronization of VBLANK start against an external timing source. Updated the MC6845 device to call reset_origin() on its screen at the start of each frame if a screen is present.
       - 0.139u3            : Rewritten mc6845.c to allow mid frame changes to the counter registers. This enables drivers to use advanced split screen and scrolling effects using a regular MC6845 [Wilbert Pol].
       - 0.136u2            : Popmessages can now be used in drivers which have an MC6845 [Robbbert].

       - 0.132u1            : Curt Coder refactored MC6845 to use DEVCB and added cursor callback (for MESS).
       - 0.129u2            : Wilbert Pol force recalculation of screen parameters when only the MC6845 input clock changes.
       - 0.129              : Phil Bennett correctly setup the MC6845 device in the calomega, carrera, coinmstr, funworld, goldnpkr, rockola and usgames drivers. This fixed games crashed with an error on startup before OK.
       - 0.128u4            : MC6845 Hsync needs to toggle on every scanline [Curt Coder]. This fixed games using the MC6845 displaying the message "Mode Control 88 is not supported!!!".
       - 0.128u3            : Curt Coder reverted MC6845 changes as they broke a number of things. This fixed crash/hanging in many games using the MC6845. Hooked up 6845 to PEPlus driver [Couriersud]: Hooked up 6845 in a daisy chain way into existing "6845 emulation". Clocks from schematics. Video size issues - 6845 code related, discussion started on list.
       - 0.128u2            : Curt Coder fixed skewing and display area in MC6845.
       - 0.128u1            : MC6845 changes [Curt Coder]: Added cursor and display enable skewing. Added preliminary support for SY6545-1's transparent addressing mode. Hsync should be pulsed even when vsync is active.
       - 0.124              : Zsolt Vasvari added option in MC6845 to programatically set the clock pin. This is needed by at least one MESS driver. Added mc6845_set_hpixels_per_column() for the Hercules gfx adapter.
       - 0.123u6            : James Wallace converted the MPU4 driver to use an HD6845, as the Hitachi part was on the PCB, while also using it to generate the VBLANK, rather than hardcoding a value. Added the pulldown resistor to the network, and added all the conditional inputs. Please note that on the later Cabinet Types (Ready Steady Go-1 onwards), the 10p slot is locked out (location of the true register for this is unknown), but the input setting is correct - you have to use Coin 2 or higher to get money in. Zsolt Vasvari fixed screen != NULL assert.
       - 0.123u5            : Zsolt Vasvari changed the MC6845 to take and pass device_config's only. The following shook out from this that are applicable to other devices as well: Running_machine is no longer taken, passed or stored MC6845_t is now private. Since passing device_config's is not device type safe, I added a get_safe_token() to mc6845.c to check the device passed in for the valid type. Changed MC6845 to take a screen tag instead of a screen number. Fixed flickering in Electric Yo-Yo. Changed qix driver to use the MC6845's VSYNC notification for interrupts. Added some new 6845 varieties: MC6845-1, H46505, HD6845 and SY6545-1.
       - 0.123u4            : MC6845 updates [Zsolt Vasvari]: Now signalling both 0->1 and 1->0 transitions of syncing pins. Added mc6845_assert_light_pen_input; uses a timer for latching the light pen address. Added reset device function. Implemented VSYNC height computation difference between the Motorola and the Rockwell devices. Since the Commodore 40xx computers program an HSYNC width that extends past the end of the scanline, I am clamping it in lack of anything better to do. Added support for the Commodore 6545-1 device type. Added support for the status register. Better variable names. More asserts. Aaron Giles converted MC6845 read/write handlers to READ/WRITE8_DEVICE_HANDLERs. Updated all MC6845-using drivers to use the new macros and call the updated functions. Removed the many little helper functions that used to do this work.
       - 0.123u3            : Zsolt Vasvari added support for cursors in the MC6845 emulation. All 4 blinking modes are supported.
       - 0.123u2            : Zsolt Vasvari changed all drivers using the MC6845 chip to use the new device interface. Removed mc6845_config.
       - 0.123u1            : Changed emu\video\crtc6845.c/h to emu\video\mc6845.c/h. MC6845 updates [Zsolt Vasvari]: Changed the 6845 to be handle based -- adjusted all drivers. Allow reading registers 12 and 13. Reading write-only registers return 0. Updated comments in header.
       - 0.115u2            : Zsolt Vasvari changed the CRTC6845 emulator to optionally control the screen configuration and video rendering. Updated the Qix and Spiders driver to use the new functionality. Added notifications for when the display enable pin changes in order to drive blanking signals.
       - 0.115              : Aaron Giles hooked up 6845 CRTC to the qix-based games. All games now generate display resolutions and frame rates on the fly. Cleaned up memory maps and a few other bits along the way. Added save state support.
       - 0.107u1            : Updates to the MagicFly driver [Robert Fresca]: Figured out the MC6845 (mapped at $0800-$0801). Fixed the screen size based on MC6845 registers. Fixed the visible area based on MC6845 registers. Fixed gfx rom region. Solved the NMI/vblank issue. Now attract works. Changed CPU clock to 625 kHz. Added new findings to the technical notes. Marked magicfly PAL as NO_DUMP (read protected).
       - 0.33b5             : Added vidhrdw\crtc6845.c/h. Added Motorola 6845 CRT Controller interface driver.

       6847

       - 0.188              : Fixed "Semigraphics 6" mode on (MESS) CoCo/MC-10 (issue reported by Jim Gerrie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmsWqdiwH2o). Displays "stripes" for video bytes $00-$7F because INT/EXT is asserted but A/S is not, and there is no external ROM [Nathan Woods].
       - 0.177              : Fixed a bug from where video data was sampled that could cause too many samples to be loaded in low MC6847 resolution video modes [Nathan Woods].
       - 0.170              : Fixed (MESS) Goldstar FC-100 and Sanyo PHC-25 crash at start and Samsung SPC-1000 crash when a letter key is pressed [Osso].
       - 0.154              : Added internal character generator ROM and M5C6847P-1 variant [Curt Coder, Anna Wu]. Added character generator ROM for S68047. Added memory region for MC6847 chargen ROM [Curt Coder]. Fixed usage of uninitialized member in mc6847_base_device [Oliver Stöneberg]. Avoid MC6847 one-time buffer underflow when (MESS) Goldstar FC-100 is starting up [Robbbert]. Converted MC6847 to use DEVCB2, delegates and inline configs [Fabio Priuli]. Removing seemingly inert chargen area; even if this is the way to go, this needs to be implemented in a better way [Nathan Woods].
       - 0.153              : Fixed MC6847 text display with external rom. Fixes (MESS) spc1000 and phc25 [Robbbert]. HSync and fsync are part of MC6847 so DEVCB2 conversion was needed there not in gime, this fixes (MESS) coco3 issue [Miodrag Milanovic].
       - 0.150              : Small PALETTE_INIT cleanup in video\mc6847.h [Oliver Stöneberg].
       - 0.148u3            : Turning off MC6847 logging left on. MC6847 optimizations [Nathan Woods].
       - 0.148u2            : Moved mess\video\mc6847.c/h to mame\scr\emu\video\ [Curt Coder]. Fixed uninialized MC6847 variables and member [Oliver Stöneberg]. Fixed array out of bounds access in mess\video\mc6847.c (MT05116: Invalid read of size 1) [Oliver Stöneberg]. Changed the amount of scanlines on the 6847 PAL emulation. That said, the 6847 versions for PAL surely are doing more than this... At least laser1 on the MESS side works better [Nathan Woods].
       - 0.148u1            : (MESS) CoCo: Made the MC6847 emulation support mid-scanline video mode changes. This will enable the video in the CoCo 2 game "Dragon Fire" to work correctly when we get a cycle exact 6809 emulation [Nathan Woods]. Workaround for MC6847 "comparison is always true due to limited range of data type" warning which makes Apple GCC unhappy [Fabio Priuli].
       - 0.147              : Added mess\video\mc6847.c/h.

       - 0.147u1            : Palette init can't be made inside any other place then main machine config, therefore palette in this case must be set in device_start. RB: better move this to RGB32 so no need of palette, otherwise will not work with other video devices [Miodrag Milanovic]. Converted TMS9928/9 to using RGB32 bitmap so chips can coexist with other video screens [R. Belmont].
       - 0.147              : Relocated scanline timer start at the first active pixel instead of left border, this makes accurate timing interrupt VDP (video\tms9928a.c) [hap].

       V9938
       - 0.185       : New device interface for palettes. Created device_palette_interface, which takes over most functionality from palette_device except for the initialization/decoding routines and RAM interface. Updated screen_device and device_gfx_interface to use a device_palette_interface object rather than a palette_device. This necessitates slight alterations to a few drivers and devices. Modified v9938 and v9958 to use the new device_palette_interface rather than a subdevice. This entails breaking a cyclic dependency between device_video_interface and screen_device for this case. A little cleanup V9938 [AJR].
       - 0.166       : Fixed (MESS) MSX2 and MSX2+ wrong screen resolutions, borders and refresh rates. Fixed also visible area and VSync in (MAME) big10.c, csplayh5.c, kas89.c, kurukuru.c, meritm.c, sangho.c, sfkick.c, sothello.c and tonton.c. Fixed off by one for PAL timing [Wilbert Pol].
       - 0.165       : Added clock to device configuration for V9938 [Wilbert Pol].
       - 0.164       : Colour mask should not influence the pattern mask as in the TMS911x VDP (video\v9938.c). Fixes MT05711 on MSX2 machines. Removed set_resolution() method, simplifying the code a bit. All drivers were defaulting to the 'HIGH' setting anyway. This also puts the drivers back in charge of setting the screen parameters [Wilbert Pol].
       - 0.154       : Let's make V9938 a bit safer; fixes black screens in (MESS) hotbit20 and expert20 MSX drivers [Wilbert Pol].
       - 0.153       : Fixed V9938 graphics regression in debug version only of (MESS) Philips NMS-8220 [Osso].
       - 0.152       : Fixed crash in debug builds (video\v9938.c) [Wilbert Pol].

       - 0.147u3     : Wilbert Pol removed the V9938 "ignore-sprite-limit" hack entirely.
       - 0.147       : Miodrag Milanovic fixed memleak for csplayh5 driver, please check do not have CHD (video\v9938.c).
       - 0.146u3     : Now using V9938 own address space for attached video memory, appears in memory selection list in debugger. Also cleaned up V9938. Introduced symbolic constants for TMS99xx CPUs interrupt lines. Added a special RESET line handled by the CPU, not by the emulator core. TMS9928a/V9938: Introduced dedicated RESET line [Michael Zapf].
       - 0.144u6     : Removed video\v9938mod.c. Reorganized the v9938 device as a modern C++ device. Removed v9938mod.c in favor of template functions in v9938.c directly [Aaron Giles].
       - 0.139u4     : Michael Zapf set V9938 default value for status register 4 and 6.
       - 0.136u4     : Curt Coder added scanline timer-based vblank interrupt to the Merit Megatouch driver to work around the broken V9938 interrupts. Megatouch games are now working again.
       - 0.122u8     : Aaron Giles replaced use of cycles_currently_ran() in v9938 code with mame_rand(), since that is effectively the same thing.
       - 0.111u5     : Nathan Woods updated the Yamaha V9938 MSX2 video driver to use the new BITMAP_ADDR* macros instead of using the line[] array.
       - 0.106u6     : Added vidhrdw\v9938.c/h and v9938mod.c.

- 0.154              : ROC10937 has now proper device line accessors for the clock (sclk), reset (por) and data (data). All affected drivers have been updated to use these [James Wallace].
- 0.146u5            : Correct an error in the ROC10935/7 lookup table for the '7' character [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.146u4            : ROC10937 converted to a modern device [James Wallace]: Still needs proper character clock timing for the brightness effects. Displays now have to be added to the CONFIG_START, and take the form 'MCFG_ROC10937_ADD(tag,port,RIGHT_TO_LEFT/LEFT_TO_RIGHT)'. The last option represents the direction for moving from start to end on the display. Converted all drivers that used the old form (bfmsys85.c, globalfr.c, jpmimpct.c, jpmsys5.c, maygay1b.c, mpu3.c, mpu4.c, mpu4vid.c and proconn.c), adding improved serial communications where documentation is known.

- 0.108u2            : El Condor cleaned up the vacfdisp module to display 14 and 16 segment displays. Added a separate character set for the OKI MSC1937. Changes Scorpion 2 to the new system. Tidied up the 6840 emulator a bit.
- NOTES: VFD (Vacuum Fluorescent Display) controllers of the BFM BD1 vfd display (OKI MSC1937) have a built in character table, which converts the displayable characters into on/off signals for the various segments. However, each controller has its own way of assigning the segments, making standardisation a problem. Currently, the model used by the OKIMSC1937 is considered as a standard with the BD1 model converted to it at drawing time.

- NOTES : In the late 80s, Arcadia collaborated with Mastertronic to create their own ten-interchangeable-game arcade platform called the Arcadia Multi Select system, using the same hardware as the beloved Commodore Amiga computer. In fact, the Multi Select's main PCB is an A500 motherboard, to which the ROM cage is attached through the external expansion port. Reportedly the system was also (or was originally) supposed to have been released in two five-game Super Select versions--"Arcade Action" and "Sports Simulation"- but no specimens of these have ever been seen. Piggyback 1.5mb rom board, a 8255 parallel peripheral interface, DALLAS DS1220Y NVRAM and PAL16L8.

- NOTES : The hardware is a variant of the Jaguar home console. The interesting thing about the CoJag system is that the designer had the option of using either a 68010 or a MIPS R3000 as the primary CPU. The CoJag also had an IDE interface so you could hook up a hard disk, which is what Area 51 uses. As far as I know, nobody has yet attempted to emulate the CoJag hardware.

- NOTES : The games are protected with dongles. There are five types of dongles (PROM/EPROM with 32, 2048, 4096, 32768 bytes data or NOP's). The tape use a leader-BOT-data-EOT-trailer format: A cassette has a transparent piece of tape on both ends, leader and trailer. And data tapes also have BOT and EOT holes, shortly before the leader and trailer. The holes and clear tape are detected using a photo-resitor. When rewinding, the BOT/EOT signal will show a short pulse and if rewind continues a constant high signal later. The specs say the holes are "> 2ms" in length.

- CPU: Intel 386 DX 25MHz / 33MHz    Sound: Z80 8MHz, YMF271F      Video: 320x240, 6144 colors
- NOTES: The Seibu SP system consists of a main board and a plug-in cartridge containing the game software. The games on SPI hardware can be swapped by changing the top cartridge and then moving jumper JP072 to the alternative position. This re-flashes some ROMs for a few minutes (accompanied by a techno music track). Afterwards, a message tells you to put the jumper back to the original position and reboot the PCB. The new game then plays. There were a few revisions of this hardware, though most are the same with only minor changes such as different IC revisions etc.

H25.1   Model 2

- 29th January   2009: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 Final: Fixed TGP emulation bugs and added missing opcodes. Virtua Fighter 2 and Virtua Cop 2 are now playable. There is still a bug with VF2 hair/body collisions, probably another TGP bug, but it's quite hard to find... * Fixed I960 bug that caused daytona invisible walls/holes in the road. * Fixed timer bug that caused missing hair in Fighting vipers, tails in sonic and slow cars in Sega Rally (although they still don't work properly). * Added support for "return to neutral". Enable it with HoldGears=1 option in emulator.ini. This setting will cause the emu to return to neutral when no gear button is pressed. * Redone rasterizer color decoding and texture mapping. Now it works the same way the real hardware does, performing all the same table lookups and calculations, so color should be accurate now. The color decoding is now done at pixel shader level so you'll need a PS 2.0 capable video card in order to run the emulator now. * Fixed white borders in some transparent textures. * Redone texture caching code. Improved dirty texture detection. Fixes wrong textures in some games when a new texture overlaps partially with an existing one. * Changed ManxTT sound roms to the Twin ones. The previous romset was using the Deluxe ones that have 2 sound boards. Fixes the "japanese speech when braking" bug :).Set the machine to Twin. * Added 2 mice support for shooting games. Enable it with RawInput=1 in emulator.ini. Read some other options there to tell the emu how to map a mouse to a player. When using RawInput the mouse will be locked to the emulator window. In order to switch to another window, either press Alt to bring the menu and unlock the mouse or use Alt-Tab to switch to another application. * Fixed Alt key not activating the window menu. * Fixed MB86235 bug when handling denormalized numbers that caused top skater and overrev lock the emu sometimes. * Fixed corrupt textures sometimes when loading a savestate. * Fixed frameskipping bug that caused some data not being updated in the TGP memory when frameskipping (daytona windows not updating windows after entering/leaving the tunnel). * Added an option to hide the crosshair in shooting games (DrawCross=0 in emulator.ini). * Fixed Daytona to the maxx rom loading that caused wrong and missing graphics. * Improved FM emulation support to the SCSP for some HOTD tunes requiring it. * Fixed various bugs in the new MultiPCM sound emulation, causing some wrong loops and sounds. * Fixed meshed transparencies size. Now they will scale to the selected resolution. * Fixed specular highlights calculation. * Added Daytona USA '93 edition and Daytona USA: GTX 2004. * Added Rail Chase 2. * Added Virtua Cop 2. * Added Virtua Fighter 2, Rev A, Rev B and 2.1. * Added Sega Water Ski. The current sound rom dump seems to be bad so the game will run without sound. This game will start in Japan region mode. To change the region, enter Test menu (F2) and press the sequence up,up,down,down,service (f1),test (f2). * Added Indianapolis 500 Rev A. * Changed romsets to match MAME as much as possible.
-  6th December  2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: The bug with the strange textures near the edge of the road on the expert course of Daytona is fixed. I did a complete redump of the Daytona rom, and it turned out to be identical to the current dump, byte for byte. So it was not due to a bad dump after all, and ElSemi fixed it very quickly. This is good news for anyone worried about needing yet another version of the Daytona rom.
- 28th November  2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: Daytona needs to be redumped for 0.9 as it turns out that the ROM everyone has been using all this time is actually a bad dump and has some corrupted textures on the Expert track. If you look at the apex as you exit the difficult building-turn at the start of the track, it becomes a squished version of the road texture. This also happens intermittently around the track on other turns. I checked it compared to the boards and it's definitely a result of a bad dump.
-  9th November  2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Lucisac: The Model 2 Emulator BETA4 brings significant improvements over BETA3 bringing emulation of Model 2 hardware to the next level. Changes include a set of new features, new games and revisions, graphical improvements, audio improvements and many bug fixes both in the major and minor categories. New Features: Dual mouse support for shooting games (via new .ini entry "UseRawInput"). The crosshair can now be set on and off (via new .ini entry "DrawCursor"). New Games: Daytona USA GTX2004, Indianapolis 500 Deluxe Rev A and Top Skater (USA). Improvements: The colour tables have been correctly emulated resulting in accurate colour reproduction for all games. Shooting the corners of the screen in gun games whilst in fullscreen mode no longer alters the emulator window or exits by use of the new .ini entry "UseRawInput". When the game fades in or out to and from white, there is no longer a significant performance hit, and the appearance of the transition is now accurate. When selecting the course in Wave Runner, the clouds are no longer red. In Zero Gunner, the audio effect of the boss chopper no longer prematurely sounds during the game. There is no longer a performance drop during certain scenes at the final boss stage in Virtual On Cybertroopers. The BGM volume no longer drops dramatically (almost mute) during a game of Zero Gunner. All analogue controls now function in Wave Runner. The ambience effects (wind/lightening/water etc) now sound during the demo and gameplay in Virtua Fighter 2. The audio in Virtua Cop now supports full FM Synth mode resulting in accurate sound reproduction. In the 2nd lap of the long course in Super GT 24h, there is no longer texture corruption. When setting the country to export in Sky Target with Advertise sound ON, pressing F3 no longer causes the BGM to not play on the first cycle. During the initial entry screen in Sega Touring Car Championship, the BGM now loops instead of terminating prematurely. The sky in some courses in Over Rev are no longer red and display the correct colour. Indy 500 no longer experiences a pause during the "ladies and gentlemen start your engines" screen. There is no longer a performance hit in Fighting Vipers in the Jane stage. There are no longer green artefacts in the facial features in Dead or Alive and Virtua Fighter 2. Daytona USA to the Maxx has now been restored and loads up. White pixels that plagued Daytona USA car rear window bars and race lights have been fixed. There is no longer a performance hit when racing up the hill in Daytona USA advanced course. The music no longer ends abruptly when completing Behind Enemy Lines. The semi-dotted line no longer appears in many games in backdrops like Sega Rally, Dead or Alive, Behind Enemy Lines, Super GT24h, Over Rev and perhaps others. After losing to the final boss in Virtual On Cybertroopers, the explosion no longer disables the BGM.
- 20th October   2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - ElSemi: The way the LOD selection for mipmaps that the model2 hardware performs is still not understood, and it's quite complex, as it requires several conversion tables and parameters that are stored in the display list, polygon header and texture header. I have some clues on how it might work, but it's still not correct and not working yet. If you set AutoMip=1, then the emu tells direct3D to generate all the mipmaps from the highest resolution one. The rest of mipmaps stored in the texture sheets aren't used. The LOD selection is left to D3D internal method, and it causes to switch to lower levels too near from the view point, causing very blurry textures. If you set Trilinear=1, the emu uploads the mipmaps from the texture sheets to D3D textures. There is no (known) indication in the texture header on how many mipmaps the texture sheet contains, so the emu always loads the maximum number (5 LODs). The LOD selection is left to D3D internal method too, so when it chooses to use a LOD that the game didn't upload a mipmap for, it causes black or wrong textures to appear, depending on whether that given texture area is just blank, of it was used to store another texture. In model 2, the part I know works as follows: The display list can upload a table of coefficients to scale the distance (dot product of Vertex0 with normal) of a polygon (let's call this d), this table has 32 different coeffs, let's call them C. It also uploads a table to computes the fractional part of the base 2 logarithm of a given value (it's used for d). There is a command to select a LOD offset. Let's call this L. In the polygon header, it can select one of these 32 scaling coeffs (C) to apply to the distance (d). When sending a poly to the rasterizer, the geometrizer multiplies C by d and by L and sends it along with the transformed vertices and the luminance and front/rear face bit to the rasterizer port. Then little is known on how this value inside the rasterizer selects the LOD level to use, except that it uses the base 2 logarithm of this value. Once I know how to get this value (from 0 to 4) I could sample it from a given lod from the pixel shader (by using tex2dlod, but it will require Pixel Shader 3). Sampling from the given lod, and the next one, and interpolating with the fractional part of the LOD will get a trilinear filtering. Update: I forgot to write that what daytona does in the course selection screen is changing the lod offset (L value) so it forces the hw to select the lower resolution lods as if the polys were very far, so the rasterizer uses the low detail textures, then slowly decreases it so they "come closer" (virtually, as they are at the same view distance), making the HW use the higher resolution textures as they approach.
- 13th October   2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: Original model 2 games now display the correct brightness/contrast settings for their cabinet modes. The clouds in Virtua Cop that weren't displaying correctly with the old saturation shader (now completely removed) are working fine now. Another update: Masked texturemaps will no longer have little white pixes around the edges.
-  8th October   2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: Virtua Fighter 2 with improved colours: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoVOIPYnYsg&fmt=18. Another game that's looking much better: Virtual On. Viper 2's paint is no longer fading. And a few more: fv1 and sonic1.
-  5th October   2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Wesker: Rewritten part of video emulation: now more colors show correctly. Added "Indianapolis 500 (Rev A)". Lucisac: One of the most important advancements in 0.9 is the correctly emulated color mixer (2nd last update in the list above) that has just occurred recently. Personally I am really excited about this improvement. Although you will need a Pixel Shader 2.0 card or above to take advantage of the benefits, they include resolution of many clipping issues, accurate color reproduction in all games (except 2 being worked on), which means no more need for the saturation shader (but thanks to the guy who cooked it up) and more. This change also brings a potential performance improvement that may be quite noticeable. ElSemi has rewritten the majority of the rasterizer and texture cache so textures are now cached in the original format (unpacked), meaning less memory usage and a reduction in texture updating that will fix many performance problems like the fade ins and outs of white. There is still work being done to optimize the change in code so stay tuned.
- 14th September 2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: I've sent a new 2A board to Elsemi so I suppose he could capture it and check to make sure. No new hair updates yet, no. And subsequently nothing on GTX either as ElSemi is still working on a solution to dump the strange board. He will most certainly figure it out though! The problem is (and I'm paraphrasing here) that there are 2 banks to dump, but both he and I have only been able to dump the first bank. There is an instruction that Daytona GTX would give during the game to tell the board when to switch between banks for whatever reason. The problem is manually sending the board that instruction so that it's possible to read the 2nd bank and make the complete rom. And the emulator will also need a small code adjustment to make this work, although that apparently will be easy.
- 10th September 2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Lucisac: Thanks to SuperRayman who reported the issue with missing instruments in Virtua Cop 1, they have now been emulated.
-  8th September 2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: The Daytona GTX board has arrived and a bit of bad news: The 2A board really is dead. Must have been damaged in transit. I will try and source another one though.
-  6th September 2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Lucisac: This morning ElSemi has been improving the communication between the main CPU & sound CPU. What was occurring before was the sound stack became full and the last sounds were missed and not executed. One scenario was in Sega Rally Championship, where if you accelerated and stopped too quickly during the countdown, the word "GO" would not sound, and sometimes the BGM would stop. These are ElSemi's words summarised. Peabo: ElSemi is busy working on some other extremely cool things which are equally as amazing as m2emulator, so progress at the moment is slow. But he is very close to being finished with them. It's also important to remember that he had a well deserved holiday recently. The GTX board will arrive next week as well as a proper switched mode PSU so that he can power up the 2A board finally. This does not necessarily mean that any new developments will be made, but it will certainly make things easier as he had to run the 2A game DSP tables on the Daytona board originally. It also means he can see what VF2 is supposed to look like since the game will hopefully boot this time.
- 30th August    2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: I suppose people are desperate for new news so here is a small bit: Daytona GTX still needs to be properly dumped. We tried all sorts of stuff to dump the extra board that came with it but to no avail. It has 2 ICs on it as well as some other strange stuff to make them work in conjunction. We can get it to read one bank, but are unable to tell the board to access the 2nd one using the dumping software. ElSemi is building his own interface to read & dump both ICs properly. I will be sending him the GTX stuff when he's completed it.
- 29th July      2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: The ambient sounds in VF2 are now working.
- 28th July      2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Lucisac: After extensive testing of the Model 2 Emulator 0.9 BETA3, I have been able to mark 17 bugs as resolved (BETA2 to BETA3). This is great news, also on top of that some new features are due to be on it's way, once tested as working, you will be the first to know! Hair and props in Fighting Vipers now move (collision problems still under analysis). The audio in House Of The Dead now supports full FM Synth mode. The smoke from the tyres in Over Rev is now correctly aligned. The board check in Rail Chase 2 now functions. The speed of the AI cars in Sega Rally Championship is now correct. The music in Virtua Cop 2 no longer stops when shooting down the Pier St sign. The music in Virtua Cop 2 is no longer delayed during the demo. The placement of the heads in Virtua Fighter 2 is now adjusted correctly. The framerate of Virtua Cop 2 is now correct. The framerate of Virtua Fighter 2 is now correct. 7 games suffering from the 'invalid opcode' error were fixed (hitting F3 to reset a game).
- 27th July      2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: ElSemi says: Hair shows now, and gravity works (sort of). but object/body collisions don't work and the hair crosses the body. Update: Hair is working in both VF2 & FV. Sega Rally cars are now running at the correct speed.
- 25th July      2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: All games will look bad compared to the original arcade. The monitors they used were specifically designed to ONLY handle the model 2 resolution of medium-res 496x384 so the resulting image would be very smooth.All model 2 games will look blocky since the architecture does not support gourad shading. If you're alluding to the difference in brightness, this cannot have anything to do with the colours since you'll observe the exact same behaviors with colormode 1. This is a geometrizer (lighting) problem. The 'color mixer' even if emulated correctly will not change the way Daytona's colours look as of 0.9. As I have said many times, the colours are correct, there is no ambiguity, they are definitely correct. I have the original arcade which I can look at to make comparison. Any differences you see are due to different lighting. This is apparent from looking at 0.8a where the same problems with darker windscreens can be observed. If it was a colour issue then colormode1 & 2 would exhibit different characteristics in this area. All the games have different methods for handling the colours. That is why VF2, FV and Sonic Fighters all have the same problems whereas Sega Rally & Indy 500 both look great. There is no magic fix for the colour mixer to make everything right. Daytona is completely different from Top Skater. If those problems were related, we'd be seeing pink signs in Daytona too. No approaches have been abandoned. If there is a way to emulate everything perfectly without the use of a 3rd part shader, then that would be great. The thing is that Daytona looks right now so it's been left so that other things can be worked on. That is why we now have VF2 and FV. Once all the annoying bugs have been ironed out, the drive board roms are correctly emulated and a few other little things are fixed, maybe work can be done on perfect colour emulation for all games. Maybe in 1.0 for example. Please try not to worry. I'm not saying that the way Daytona is emulated is the perfect approach, but the end result is the same, and for the moment at least, it is fine. Force feedback is fine the way it is, but ElSemi had to approximate a lot since he didn't know that FFB was handled by a different board. I personally don't have any issues with the vibrating. I'm pretty sure your wheel is meant to vibrate when you start a game on sega rally to simulate the engine effect, but I could be wrong. But regardless, he should now be able to do it more accurately. Previously it was being handled for every game using the same type of signals that Daytona outputs, but in reality each game's drive board has a slightly different rom, so each game will send different signals to the motor. You probably won't even notice the difference, but it's one step closer to perfect emulation.
- 24th July      2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: ElSemi is working on getting the hair and other elements working in VF2 and FV.
- 23rd July      2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: The disappearing player models bug in VF2 is definitely fixed now, so the game is playable. The characters just have no hair sometimes.
- 22nd July      2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: ElSemi narrowed the hairs gravity problem down to an i960 bug since Fighting Vipers also has no hair though it uses a totally different DSP program. It's also the i960 that's causing the slow opponents in Sega Rally.
- 21st July      2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: Guru may have a bit of trouble redumping VCop 2 because he doesn't have the boards handy and would have to go to where the cabinet is located or get the cabinet sent to him to do it. I will try to borrow the EPROMs that were bad and redump them myself in the meantime, and also try and redump that bad Manx TT sound rom (I'm sure you're tired of hearing a Japanese lady every time you skid). Update: Guru was able to find some VCop 2 roms, so it's been redumped. Hopefully it's a good dump!
- 20th July      2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: Vcop 2 is a bad dump apparently! Guru will need to redump it. Vcop works fine, but the rom is bad so some polygons are missing. VF2 has upside-down characters at the moment, but that's being worked on. Update: Fixed upside down fighters. Update2: VF2 still has colour problems very similar to what Daytona used to. The same goes for Fighting Vipers, Sonic Fighters (same engine) and a few others.
- 19th July      2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: VF2 isn't working yet. The 2A board still hasn't been powered up properly due to issues with the PSU. But for now ElSemi is running some of the 2A chips on the Daytona rom board. He has already seen differences in the DSP output. Progress is being made.
- 18th July      2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: I've ordered Daytona GTX which will be dumped and added to 0.9.
- 13th July      2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: Fixed Daytona colours.
- 12th July      2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: The version of VF2 I sent is apparently the original version (revision A). The current dumped ones were rev B and 2.1. Also the dump of Daytona Deluxe '93 was successful too. Update: ElSemi is having a few problems getting the VF2 board to boot, but I'm sure it's because he's using a regular PC power supply. Those things need a decent amount of voltage to get them running. I know I can make Daytona crash if I turn the voltage down on my PSU. There are no error LEDs on the board when it turns on so hopefully it's fine.
-  1st July      2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Peabo: The colours are almost perfect now. There are a few problems with the dark greens, blues & grays (the grass, tires and sky reflection are the most prominent examples of this), but they can certainly be fixed as they were fine when ElSemi originally tired this method to fix the colours in early versions of 0.5. It must have been something else that was changed between 0.5 and 0.8 that makes them so dark in the new screenshots. Unfortunately ElSemi forgot exactly what he changed! Luckily I can run the boards to look at the actual colours for reference. ElSemi's ones run a bit too bright on his monitor, unfortunately. It's probable that they will be perfect (at least in Daytona) in 0.9. By the way, there is a new feature in 0.9: meshed textures that are resolution dependent. So you will still see them if you run Daytona at a high res. On a side note, I've sent 2 EEPROMs to ElSemi which should enable him to look at the DSP tables on VF2 and VCop2 (using the Daytona board) in order to hopefully get those games functioning. They should be with him in a day or two.
- 28th June      2008: Model 2 Emulator v0.9 WIP - Added an option to regulate the Gamma values of the RGB (separately). Eliminated the errors related to invisible walls in Daytona the USA. Fixed a problem in the sound of Model 2, that caused loops in some samples.
- 24th June      2008: ElSemi - Model 2 emulator 0.8a: Fixed missing trigger buttons in gun games. Fixed Desert Tank locked into test mode. Improved main cpu/sound CPU sync in Model2 Original games.
- 23rd June      2008: ElSemi - Model 2 emulator 0.8: Rewritten the MultiPCM sound chip emulation. It fixes Original Model2 games sounds and music. Fixed eye paremeters being read as unsigned by the display list parser, causing bad geometry in daytona 4 players attract and sega rally 2 players attract. Fixed network board detection for sgt24h and overrev. Now you don't need to enable network to have them boot. Adjusted daytona steering limits to the real machine limits (according to the service manual). It should have a more accurate handling now. Added force feedback for car driving games. You need to enable it in the .ini using the option EnableFF=1 in the Input section. You can tweak more force parameters in that section. Also some games only enable the force feedback if the cabinet type is set to Deluxe in the test mode. Added XInput support. You can enable XInput support in the .ini in the Input section. XInput allows direct access to XBox360 compatible controllers for vibration (they don't support vibration through DirectInput). Keep in mind that the windows XInput libraries only support vibration force feedback so an XBox360 driving controller won't have working force effects. Added optional meshed polygons for translucency (like the hardware does). Enable it with MeshTransparency=1 in the ini. This option requires a Pixel Shader 3 capable videocard. Fixed HOTD rom loading that caused missing tilemap graphics (how to play, map on gameover). Added preliminary savestates support. The sound engine state is not being saved yet. I've added this so I can ask for states to try to fix the invisible walls problem in daytona.
-  4th June      2008: ElSemi - Model 2 emulator 0.7a: Fixed network code not fully working (I accidentally left a part disabled in the last build). Improved daytona video & sound sync.
-  3rd June      2008: ElSemi - Model 2 emulator 0.7: More accurate emulation of some TGP by using the data tables from the mainboard. You'll need these table roms in Model2.zip or inside the game zip. Thanks to Peabo for the donation of a Daytona board that helped to understand how they worked. This has fixed most of the bugs in daytona usa (reverse and most invisble wall hits) and sega rally (automatic transmission). Improved color table decoding that gives more bright colors for some games. Improved SCSP timing. It should be more accurate and musics should not sound out of sync anymore. As a bonus feature i've left in a debug sound player that allows you to load a SSF (Saturn Sound Format) file for playing. To use it, load a game using SCSP (model 2a,b or c) and enter test mode (so it doesn't send sound commands) then press LeftControl+F5 and choose the ssf file to play. Improved clipping. By moving to vertex/pixel shaders i've got rid of all the clipping issues that happened with ATI video cards and recent NVIDIA ones. Remember to remove set SoftwareVertexProcessing to 0. You'll need a pixel shader 1.1 and vertex shader 1.1 capable card. It's the lowest shader version so any video should work. As a side effect of this change, there is only a geometrizer now, so the Geometrizer opion in the ini file is not used. Fixed problems with textures ending in the lowest line of the texture sheet not being uploaded to direct3d (Sega Rally black background in 2nd stage and Topskater missing floors). Added Wave Runner (Model 2C). Added support for direct3d automimpap generation (see emulator.ini AutoMip option). Added network emulation.
-  3rd January   2008: ElSemi - Model 2 emulator 0.6: So many changes that I can't remember. Lighting fixes, control fixes and sound fixes. ManxTT is working, but sound is broken. Merged some features from the CPS3 emu (vsync, custom fullscreen res,...).
- 29th May       2007: ElSemi - Model 2 emulator 0.5a: Fixed (hopefully at last) the analog wraparound bug. Fixed wrong colour table translation in vcop madium and expert levels. Added a couple of useful features: Launch game from commandline (just add the driver name. ex: Emulator.exe stcc) and Auto-switch to fullscreen after game loading (the option is in the Video menu).
- 24th May       2007: ElSemi - Model 2 emulator 0.5: This release fixes several playability bugs in Daytona USA (analog controls wraparound and windows disappearing when going to fullscreen) and adds a new playable game: Motor Raid. It also contains a modified color lookup table processing that improves the colors in the original model 2 games (daytona, vcop and dtank). The emulator now includes a nice icon and background image, thanks to jordigahan and Peabo for them.
-  3rd April     2007: ElSemi - Model 2 emulator 0.4: The Model 2 Emulator supporting some Model 2 and Model 2 A-CRX boards (Daytona anyone? ). This version of the emulator includes a preliminary emulation of the Fujitsu MB86234 DSP present in these boards. Keep in mind that the emulation is still preliminary, as there is no documentation on this chip, and it has been done by reverse engineering the binary programs and comparing with the model 2B and 2C programs and the MAME Model 1 HLE. I'd like to thank Olivier Galibert and Ernesto Corvi for their help in making possible this DSP emulation. Check the include README.TXT for instructions (especially how to set Daytona to Standalone machine as Multiplayer is not implemented) and known emulation bugs in the games.
- 11th February  2007: ElSemi - Model 2 emulator 0.3 MultiCPU Experimental: This is an experimental Model 2 emulator build using multithreaded code for parallel CPU, GPU and Sound emulation. It's designed to have a huge performance boost in Multi-Core CPUs (Dual Core and Core Duo) as it will allow the emulator to use both cores in parallel. As a bonus, this emulator contains an experimental recompiler SCSP DSP emulation.
- 22nd August    2006: ElSemi - Model 2 emulator 0.3: After more than 2 years without updates here is a new version of my Model 2 Emulator. The main changes are all speed related. The emu should be faster now. Also it now supports Frameskip and AutoFrameskip. This will probably be the last version of the emulator unless some Fujitsu TGP MB86234 docs appear to finish the emulation of the 2 and 2A cores.

WIP:

- 16th August   2009: Charles MacDonald - I've developed a universal device reader/programmer for 8-bit memory chips. It has the following features: * Read mask ROMs, OTPROMs, EPROMs, EEPROMs. * Read PROMs (mainly the larger variety). * Test SRAM. * Read, write, erase flash memory. * Read, write, erase and test NVRAM. * Control non-standard memory. * Device sizes of 24, 28, 32, 36, 40 pins supported, +5V only. * High speed USB interface. * Here's a picture of the unit. On the solder side, the wire link in the upper right is to correct a mistake and the center two are to route two signals which I ran out of room for. There are also components underneath the two DIP sockets on both sides of the board. The holes are for standoffs so you can mount the reader in an enclosure. LEDs are provided to indicate power (red), a fault condition such when the power distribution switch overheats or is shorted (yellow), and when USB enumeration has completed (green). The device reader assumes the target device has D0-D7 and A0-A13 in the standard location (some exceptions can be made) and uses a IDT7132 2Kx8 dual-port RAM to route eleven different inputs (RD,WR,CS,A14-A21) to eight pins of the device. This makes it simple to do things like swap A16 and /OE, merge signals such as /CE and /OE, and generally change the high-order address bus layout which is what differs the most between memory chips. As a RAM is used to configure the pin assignments of the target device, there are no physical changes to make such as adjusting jumpers, switches, or family modules. Device descriptions are loaded from a human-readable configuration file so you can add new parts and comment how they operate. As always I'll make the source code available so devices with special requirements can be added. Here's a list of devices which I have personally tested so far: EPROM 27C128, 27C256, 27C512, 27C010, 27C020, 27C040, 27C080, 27C100, 27C1000, 27C2001, 27C4000; ROM MB834000, MB838000, MB831001, MB832011: SRAM HM62256, MB8464, M5M51008, AS6C4008; NVRAM DS1230, DS1250, DS1265, DS1270 and Flash ST29EE010, Am29F010 and Am29F040. I am quite pleased with the Fujitsu MB831001/MB832011 working as the inspiration for this project came from a need to get the MegaTech version of Great Football dumped for The Dumping Union. These chips have integrated ROM banking hardware with dedicated registers and manage their own address decoding. Previous dumps for MAME were made with my SMS Cartridge Reader, but for dealing with ROMs directly (rather than cartridges) a different solution was needed. I used a Texas Instruments TPS2054 four-channel power distribution switch intended for USB hubs to route power to several pins. Unlike the ST890C I used in the PAL Device Reader, the TPS2054 doesn't need a resistor to limit the current flow and was better behaved during power-up. I also used a Microchip MCP130 reset generator after having problems with the Maxim DS1233. Both of these parts have functioned ideally and had very good documentation. I appreciate TI maintaining forums where people can get advice from their engineers, and for offering free samples of their newer chips. The PAL device reader is still under construction, and while I've made some progress analyzing feedback use in some parts, it still does not work correctly with every case. I'm definitely on the right path now, but it will just take more time and more effort. All I can ask for is continued patience.
-  3rd February 2008: Guru - Some time ago I bought an adapter for one of my EPROM Programmers for support of a 128M TSOP48 maskROM. It turns out that the same chip is used in Atomiswave carts and is easily dumped. I think I might have actually bought it for that purpose 3 years ago! The main problem now is it takes 2 1/2 hours to read one chip and to verify it with 3 reads will take an unacceptably long time. Oh yeah, so I have decided to upgrade that unit to the latest high speed USB2 model. That will set me back around AU$1800 and also requires a separate universal TSOP48 module which is another AU$400. But ahh, it's for the good of MAME-kind.

R2.1   EAROM

- 0.166              : Significant accuracy improvements, documentation and other updates to the ER-2055 EAROM emulation used for several Atari games, based on schematics and datasheets. It now uses a state machine to keep track of the current EAROM bus state (machine\atari_vg.c) [Lord Nightmare].
- 0.145              : Converted ATARIVGEAROM to modern devices [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.139u4            : Modernized liberator driver and added save state support. Moved generalized EAROM handling to machine\atarigen.c [Aaron Giles].
- 0.129u5            : Proper device nvram handling for atari_vg. Removed EAROM from Battle Zone. This fixed vector drawing corruption when using a save state [Couriersud].
- 0.27               : Added machine\atari_vg.c/h. Added generic EAROM routines for the Atari Vector games.

R2.2   EEPROM

- 0.186              : Added support for Seiko S-29X90 16-bit EEPROMs (machine\eepromser.cpp) [Luca Elia].
- 0.175              : Removed device_memory_interface in machine\eeprom.cpp [O. Galibert].
- 0.165              : Changed machine\at29040a.c/h to at29x.c/h. New AT29 flash EEPROM circuits [Michael Zapf].
- 0.155              : Added Support for MSM16911 Serial EEPROM (machine\eepromser.c) [Felipe Sanches].
- 0.154              : Removed machine\er59256.c/h. Fixed communications in machine\at45dbxx.c [O. Galibert]. Added support for X24C44 used by Fireball (machine\eepromser.c) [ANY]. Use eepromser in (MESS) rmnimbus.c and removed er59256 [Carl].
- 0.151              : Modernized ER59256 device [Osso].
- 0.150              : Added machine\eeprompar.c/h and eepromser.c/h. Renamed eeprom_device to serial_eeprom_device in anticipation of adding a parallel EEPROM device. Splitted eeprom.c into a base class base_eeprom_device and a serial-specific subclass serial_eeprom_device. Moved the latter into its own file eepromser.c and significantly cleaned up/simplified the code. The new code should be functionally the same as the previous code, but expect that to change soon. As a side-effect, the size and bus width of the EEPROM is now specified in the ADD macro rather than in the interface structure. Rewrite serial EEPROM devices, breaking them out into separate chips of the proper size and protocol. Update all drivers, removing custom implementations, and replacing them with standard ones. Moved core read, write, erase functionality into the EEPROM base class a simulated delays in write/erase cycles. Still some more testing/verification work left to do. RDY/BUSY on ER5911 is always live regardless of CS state. Fixes G.I. Joe and probably others (machine\eepromser.c). Make sure shift register is clear at the start of a read to simulate the dummy 0 bit. Fixed polarity of CS/CLK lines in mitchell.c. Fixed most regressions due to EEPROM changes. Remaining issues are noted at the top of eepromser.c. Added eeprompar.*, implementing a simple interface for parallel EEPROMs. Created atari_eeprom_device which wraps a 2804 or 2816 EEPROM with the standard Atari write-locking mechanism. Updated all drivers to use this, and removed all EEPROM stuff from atarigen [Aaron Giles]. Small DEVICE_STOP cleanup in machine\er59256.c [Oliver Stöneberg].
- 0.149              : Removed unused at28c16_interface (machine\at28c16.h) [smf].
- 0.148u5            : Finished modernizing AT28c16 (drivers\namcond1.c, namcos11.c, namcos12.c, taitogn.c, vegaeo.c and zn.c) [smf].
- 0.148u2            : Fixed uninitialized memory in machine\nmc9306.c. Fixed uninitialized and disabled unused member in machine\at45dbxx.c [Oliver Stöneberg]. Moved mess\machine\at29040a.c/h, at45dbxx.c/h and er59256.c/h to emu\machine\ [Curt Coder].
- 0.147              : Added machine\m6m80011ap.c/h [Angelo Salese].
- 0.145u8            : Various Clang warning cleanups in machine\eeprom.c [Balrog].
- 0.144u4            : Changed the 'erase' function to force all data bits of the specified address to 1s [Wilbert Pol].
- 0.143              : O. Galibert added tag name in EEPROM's verbosity.
- 0.142u4            : Aaron Giles removed legacy trampolines from eeprom_device, taking advantage of new input port support for delegates.
- 0.142              : Added machine\nmc9306.c/h (National Semiconductor NMC9306 256-Bit Serial EEPROM emulation).
- 0.138u4            : smf converted AT28C16 to a C++ device and tidied up comments.
- 0.138u2            : Aaron Giles converted the OKI M6295 and EEPROM devices to the new model. These were necessary because they both require multiple interfaces to operate and it didn't make sense to create legacy device templates for these single cases (okim6295 needs the sound interface and the memory interface, while EEPROM requires both the NVRAM and memory interfaces).
- 0.136u1            : Aaron Giles fixed typo in 8-bit EEPROM case that broke operation in some games. The starting value for an output port is now the default value, which is based on whether it is active high or low. So the device will be called the first time the line becomes active. Changed the EEPROM device to assume that the reset and clock are cleared until it's told otherwise [smf].
- 0.136              : Removed machine\eepromdev.c/h. EEPROM changes [Aaron Giles]: Fixed auto EEPROM region to properly handle 16-bit data. Changed EEPROM device to initialize EEPROM at NVRAM load time rather than init time, giving DEVICE_INIT handlers a chance to muck with the data first. Removed _NODEFAULT_ forms of EEPROM driver macros. If you need to add default data, follow the MDRV_EEPROM_ADD() with MDRV_EEPROM_DATA(). Updated remaining drivers to the new EEPROM device code. Many of them now require a default EEPROM to be loaded along with the ROMs, rather than hard-coded data in the driver. Exposed an address space for EEPROM devices, meaning the memory is now visible in the debugger and can be accessed via expressions. Updated all systems that muck directly with EEPROM memory to use memory accessors instead on the EEPROM address space. Removed old EEPROM implementation.
- 0.135u4            : Aaron Giles and Fabio Priuli changed EEPROM usage in many drivers to use the new device version. Aaron Giles cleaned up EEPROM device implementation a bit. EEPROM device now looks for a matching memory region to fetch the default values from. Fixed bug in ROM loader that would change the memory region flags to match devices with no address bus. Updated groundfx to use the new default loading scheme [Aaron Giles].
- 0.135u1            : Fabio Priuli added PORT_CUSTOM(eepromdev_bit_r) for EEPROM devices. Added a MDRV_EEPROM_NODEFAULT_ADD macro for drivers which do not need default data size / data.
- 0.130u3            : Added machine\eepromdev.c/h. Samuele Zannoli added device-based implementations of the EEPROM and i2c devices.
- 0.129u6            : Pierpaolo Prazzoli changed EEPROM erase command to write 0xff values.
- 0.129              : smf fixed AT28C16 so that a write isn't allowed to start if there is one in progress and a write isn't started if the data is already correct. This allows my dream horse to boot again. Further investigation is needed.
- 0.127              : smf changed AT28C16 memory handlers to 8 bits and perform the conversion in the memory mapping.
- 0.126u1            : Aaron Giles changed direct access EEPROM interface to return the "bus width" of the EEPROM data, and the size is in terms of units, not bytes. Updated all drivers accordingly.
- 0.125u3            : Aaron Giles renamed EEPROM_* to eeprom_*. Updated all drivers accordingly. Typedef'ed a real eeprom_interface structure.
- 0.84               : Added machine\at28c16.c/h.

2.3   EPROM Emulator

- 10th June      2010: Charles MacDonald - I've been working on a new 512K EPROM emulator for future work with several 68020-based Atari boards and an upcoming trojaning effort. The PCB design is finished, so the next step is to get the boards fabricated, assembled and write the client software.
-  1st June      2008: Charles MacDonald - Last year I designed a 16-bit EPROM emulator based around the IDT7025 8Kx16 dual-port static RAM, a very useful chip that supports 8 and 16-bit access independently on either of its RAM ports. This is what I used for running tests on my Model 1 and Jaleco Mega System 32 boards, the latter needing two emulators in parallel to emulate four EPROMs. The software to control it was a modified version of the 8-bit EPROM emulator utility. Support for multiple devices isn't implemented quite right, so just use it for controlling a single device. This ended up being my first project that used almost all surface mount parts, as well as PLCC chips. I'm quite proud of the way it came out, and so far it has been invaluable for running tests on 16-bit and 32-bit systems. Here is the PCB layout, documentation, utility program and source code: http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/zip/ds-060108.zip. At some point I was thinking of making adapter PCBs that would support 27C4096 and 27C400 type pinouts as I have a few boards with those chips instead of two 8-bit EPROMs in parallel. It's just a wiring difference but this would be a neater solution and simplify cable assembly.
-  8th November  2007: Charles MacDonald - 16-bit EPROM Emulator: I've been interested in doing some research on the Jaleco Mega System 32 hardware, which is emulated in MAME but has a few remaining issues. Guru generously donated a "Desert War" board for testing, and now I had to figure out the best way to run my own programs on it. Being a 32-bit system, the two 8-bit EPROM emulators that were developed for the Gaelco "Master Boy" dumping project wouldn't be enough as Desert War uses four 8-bit ROMs. I decided to make a new EPROM emulator based around the IDT7025, a 16K dual-port RAM. What makes this device useful is that it allows control of the individual byte lanes for both ports. This allows the RAM to be interfaced with CPUs of varying bus widths and endianness without any glue logic. On the PCB the left port connects to a FT2232 chip in Host Bus Emulation mode (an 8051-alike bus) and the right port is buffered and goes to headers for DIP cables to plug into two 8-bit ROM sockets of the target board. The real challenge with this project was assembly; the IDT7025 chips I had came in an 84-pin PLCC package. I used a Mill-Max SMT socket to attach the RAM to the board, but this meant soldering the socket to the board using a regular iron. To simplify this process, I increased the pad size of the LCC footprint inward so there was more surface area leading up to the pin pad. This greatly simplified tacking the socket in place, kept solder from bridging with adjacent pins, and made soldering all 84 pins in place a snap. I've tested the first one on a Sega Model 1 board and it works as expected, I was able to re-use the 8-bit ROM emulator code to control it so the software is done. I'll make another and that should be all that's needed to start running test programs on the Jaleco Mega System 32 hardware. I'll also put up the project files (schematic, source code, and instructions) for it soon.
- 21st September 2007: Charles MacDonald - EPROM emulator update: I've added a memory test feature to check if the RAM being used is OK. Oddly enough the Model 1 hardware draws enough power that my DS1230 NVRAM refuses to operate. Thought it was bad, but it works fine in other systems. I switched it out with a new Hitachi HM62256LP SRAM and everything is working again.





R2.4   Flash Memory

R2.41  Flash ROM

- 0.188              : Fixed global variables (machine\intelfsh.cpp) [AJR].
- 0.178              : 16-bit hook-up for the Sharp LH28F016S flash memory (machine\intelfsh.cpp) [Luca Elia].
- 0.175              : Removed device_memory_interface in machine\intelfsh.cpp [O. Galibert]. Fixed E28F400B erase, fixed 16 bit writing, removed extraneous (machine\intelfsh.cpp) [smf].
- 0.170              : Added Intel TE28F320 Flash (machine\intelfsh.cpp) [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.165              : Added support for TMS29F040 variant (machine\intelfsh.c). Fixed typos in machine\intelfsh.c (AMD_29F400T and AMD_29F800T) [Luca Elia].
- 0.158              : Refactor Funky Ball driver flash access to use intelfsh.c via bankdev, doesn't improve anything tho [David Haywood].
- 0.156              : Added support for AMD 29F400T, AMD 29F800T and FUJITSU 29F160T (machine\intelfsh.c) [Joe Sturm]. Intel component is not MXTC, it's MTXC in calchase.c, gamecstl.c, midqslvr.c, queen.c, savquest.c, taitowlf.c, voyager.c and xtom3d.c [Peter Ferrie].
- 0.153              : Fixed FLASH_INTEL_E28F400B block erase. Added basic support for FLASH_AMD_29LV200T [hap].
- 0.152              : Removed machine\secflash.c/h. Remodernised x76f041/x76f100 & ZS01 so that logging becomes easy again & uses READ_LINE_MEMBER/WRITE_LINE_MEMBER so the pins can be bound to directly. Hooked up x76f041 to the early beatmania IIDX games. They all pass the security check eventually but it takes a long time as it repeatedly reads the first byte, it's possible that the contents aren't correct as the game says the security is OK even when the data returned is not what it's checking for [smf].
- 0.150              : Added Macronix 29LV160TMC sub-type to intelfsh.c, used by Sega Dreamcast [Angelo Salese]. Fixed typo in machine\serflash.c (drivers\nexus3d.c) [David Haywood].

- 0.149              : Added machine\ataflash.c/h and machine\serflash.c/h. Split ATA flash functionality from taitogn.c into their own devices. The pccard slot has had to revert to use memory handlers instead of device maps for the moment. Move & 7. I'm pretty sure that line is never called, at least in the old code it could never reach the equivalent line (machine\ataflash.c) [smf]. Added serial Flash device (machine\serflash.c) [David Haywood].
- 0.148u2            : Moved SST39VF020/SST39VF400A emulation into intelfsh. Added READ/WRITE_MEMBER to the intelfsh device and removed some trampolines [Sandro Ronco].
- 0.148              : Added emulation of SST 28SF040 flash [Sandro Ronco].

- 0.141u3            : Added machine\secflash.c/h.
- 0.141u2            : Support Flash ROMs that have a bankswitch command (machine\intelfsh.c) [Tim Schuerewegen].
- 0.139u3            : Aaron Giles converted intelfsh to a device, updated all users. Added memory interface to the intelfsh device so you can access/view the data in the debugger and via the standard memory interfaces. Removed the old memory() method in favor of new functions read_raw()/write_raw() which do direct reads/writes of the data.
- 0.138u2            : Flash 4k sectors should erase in 1/8th the time of 64k. extend core to support GBA chip types [R. Belmont].
- 0.112u3            : smf added X76F100 emulation and ZS01 emulation (HLE of System 573 PIC).
- 0.109u5            : smf improved flash emulation and added support for Fujitsu 29F016A flash chips. Switches Konami games over to new flash chips.
- 0.104u6            : Ville Linde added the missing commands and proper maker/device IDS to the flash memory handlers for Fujitsu MBM29F016A, used by Konami Firebeat hardware (not yet emulated).
- 0.97u3             : Nathan Woods added some sanity checking, and changed a printf() to logerror() to intelfsh.c.
- 0.95u3             : smf increased FLASH_CHIPS_MAX in machine\intelfsh.h. Merged 8 & 16 bit Intel Flash NVRAM handler & passes the chip number as a parameter.

       - 0.152              : Remodernised x76f041/x76f100 & ZS01 so that logging becomes easy again & uses READ_LINE_MEMBER/WRITE_LINE_MEMBER so the pins can be bound to directly. Hooked up x76f041 to the early beatmania IIDX games. They all pass the security check eventually but it takes a long time as it repeatedly reads the first byte, it's possible that the contents aren't correct as the game says the security is OK even when the data returned is not what it's checking for [smf].
       - 0.112u3            : smf added write support to X76F041 emulation.
       - 0.109u4            : Added machine\x76f041.c/h.
       NOTES: The X76F041 is a Password Access Security Supervisor, containing four 128 x 8 bit SecureFlash arrays. Access can be controlled by three 64-bit programmable passwords, one for read operations, one for write operations and one for device configuration. The data sheet has an incorrect diagrams for sequential read with password, there shouldn't be an extra address after the 0xc0 command.

- 0.155              : Added machine\mb8421.c/h. Added MB8421 device (16KBIT dual port SRAM with 2 interrupt pins). Added MB8421 to segaybd.c game 'Power Drift (Japan, Link Version)' (untested, since linkcpu doesn't enable interrupts?).

R4.    NVRAM (Non Volatile RAM)

- 0.149              : Added NVRAMs for devices in software item named folder (machine\generic.c). This should help storing per game EEPROMs and other NVRAMs. NVRAM of root device is only stored in main folder in this case, since that is main machine NVRAM if any. Used parent image names so it will work for cmd parameters, also multiple images are supported [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.147u1            : NVRAM_HANDLER removal (drivers\bfm_sc2.c, bfm_sc4h.c, bmcbowl.c, dgpix.c, gal3.c, mitchell.c, includes\bfm_sc45.h and includes\mitchell.h) [Aaron Giles].
- 0.144u7            : Aaron Giles fixed NVRAM file naming.
- 0.144u6            : NVRAM custom init delegate are now device_delegates (capbowl.c, itech32.c and merit.c) [Aaron Giles].
- 0.143u8            : NVRAM devices each have their own files, when applicable. The output of such will be "NVRAM\setname\devicefile.". Some cases will still use the old "NVRAM\setname.NV" method until they have been converted properly [smf].
- 0.143u1            : In case of multiple BIOSes, system NVRAM will be saved in form systemname_biosnum.nv in cases when non-default BIOS is used. For default BIOS selection all stay the same [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.141u4            : Aaron Giles removed some legacy NVRAM_HANDLERs in favor of NVRAM devices.
- 0.141u3            : Aaron Giles removed public nvram_open() and fixed jchan/kaneko16 to stop directly saving NVRAM.
- 0.139u4            : Death to more NVRAM_HANDLERS [Aaron Giles].
- 0.139u3            : Added machine\nvram.c/h. Aaron Giles created a new generic NVRAM device. It can be configured to default to 0-fill, 1-fill, random-fill, or custom fill. In all cases, a same-named memory region overrides the default fill. The address range where the NVRAM can be found is now identified by an AM_SHARE() region of the same tag as the NVRAM device. Drivers can also explicitly configure a separately-allocated NVRAM region via nvram_device::set_base(). Aaron Giles replaced all instances of MDRV_NVRAM_HANDLER(generic_*) with MDRV_NVRAM_ADD_*("nvram"). Replaced all AM_BASE_GENERIC/AM_SIZE_GENERIC(nvram) with AM_SHARE("nvram"). For all remaining drivers that referenced the generic.nvram directly, changed them to hold a required_shared_ptr<UINTx> to the NVRAM in their driver state, and use that instead. Removed NVRAM and nvram_size from the generic_ptrs. Aaron Giles replaced largely redundant NVRAM handlers with NVRAM devices for namcos2 and a bunch of the Nichibutsu mahjong games. Also did it for the Atari games, moving the old hard-coded EEPROM data out into files finally.
- 0.138u2            : Added emu\dinvram.c/h.
- 0.131              : Aaron Giles changed generic NVRAM behavior so that all the variants look for a memory region named "nvram". If it is found and is of the same length as the generic_nvram_size, data is copied from there instead of filling the RAM with the fallback pattern.
- 0.130              : Aaron Giles added muting just before saving the NVRAM, and de-mute just after loading the NVRAM. Should cure the stuck sound issue for games with large NVRAM.
- 0.128u7            : Aaron Giles changed various NVRAM devices to fetch their default memory region from the device->region rather than specifying it in the configuration.
- 0.104              : Mathis Rosenhauer fixed NVRAM handling in Star Wars/ESB (only affects test mode).
- 0.103u1            : smf hooked up NVRAM in Frenzy memory map.
- 0.99               : Brian Troha hooked up NVRAM for World Class Bowling Tournament (v1.40).
- 0.96u4             : Aaron Giles added thrash protection emulation to the NVRAM in coolpool.c.
- 0.88u2             : Frank Palazzolo added NVRAM handling to Robby Roto and Professor PacMan (still not working always but self-tests pass) and support stereo in Wizard of Wor, Robby Roto, Gorf and Professor PacMan (Sounds great now!!). Added 'Reset on powerup', 'Halt on error', 'Beep', 'ROM' and 'Unknown' dipswitch.
- 0.84u5             : smf hooked up NVRAM for Namco system 12 correctly.
- 0.83               : Justin Szczap added NVRAM to Spiders.
- 0.77               : Curt Coder fixed Cue Brick NVRAM handler.
- 0.76u2             : Aaron Giles added some pre-initialization to the WarGods NVRAM.
- 0.58               : Basic generic NVRAM handlers have been added. For a number of games, it is sufficient to point the global variables 'generic_nvram' and 'generic_nvram_size' to the location and size of the NVRAM area. In the machine driver, you can now specify 'generic_0fill' or 'generic_1fill' to request a generic NVRAM handler. The 0fill and 1fill refer to how the memory is initialized in the absence of an .nv file.
- 18th June      2002: HobbesAtPlay submitted a patch to add saving the NVRAM in Tri-Sports.
- 18th January   2001: David Graves added NVRAM emulation to Slap Shot.
-  4th December  2000: Aaron Giles fixed a NVRAM bug in Rim Rockin' Basketball.
- 0.36b14            : Added OSD_FILETYPE_NVRAM. Note: Non volatile ram is now saved to a new directory, NVRAM (instead of the old HI). You must create that directory manually, otherwise the files will not be saved. Removed *hiscore_load and *hiscore_save from the GameDriver structure. To manage nvram/eeprom/cmos/etc the new *nvram_handler in struct MachineDriver must be used. High score save is temporarily disabled. It will be added again in a future release using an external .dat file [Nicola Salmoria].
