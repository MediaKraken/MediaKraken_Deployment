- Don't use AM_MASK on ram, you end up with an incorrect allocation size [O. Galibert].
- Fixed network output to include all data [headkaze].
- lk201: Fix 6805 clock to verified value [Lord Nightmare].
- Netlist changes: * Introduced HINT(device, hint) to clarify that hints are inheritent and not specific to devices * Added improved profiling support to netlist. Statistics output now proposes devices for which whole device activation/deactivation be disabled. No significant improvement for pong, but breakout experiences a 10% improvement * Introduced perftime_t and perfcount_t for gathering statistics. These templates do not create any code if statistics are not kept * Make help2man ./nltool produce usuable output * Replaced shared_ptr by unique_ptr * Better seperation of setup_t and netlist_t * Fixed bugs in rdtsc code. Refactored timer code * Moved options code from include to cpp file * More truthtable refactoring. Removed half-finished code for internal state support. As implemented, this would have had no support for timing delays * All netlist device setup is now done in the device constructor. This significantly increases readability and stability and allowed to remove init_object calls and start calls * Removed a significant amount of dead code * Remove ATTR_HOT and ATTR_COLD. Refactored netlist_time * More STL usage and c++11 * Get rid of nl_math. Remove nl_util.h and moved contents to plib/putil.h [Couriersud].
- Major refactoring of debugger core: * Eliminate globals/file statics * Remove lots of stuff from global scope * Use std::function for custom command registration * Eliminate some trampolines * Build fixes from Vas Crabb and balr0g [Ryan Holtz].
- Small update of italian traslation [AntoPISA].
- Fix keyboard shortcuts for disassembly comments panel: * Win32 previously recognised Ctrl+N but menu incorrectly showed Ctrl+M * Qt showed Ctrl+C but it was swallowed by text editing and didn't work * Ctrl+N is now shown/used by Win32 and Qt (matches Cmd-N on OS X)  [Vas Crabb].
- Fix git version: * Git version is set by top-level make, not just when GENie runs * Can set IGNORE_GIT=1 for make to ignore git * Git ignored/unavailable uses "unknown" in version string * Mark modified trees as dirty * Note that version now comes from makefile [Vas Crabb].
- A little change to device_image_interface::call_display to better decouple UI fronted and image devices [F. Ulivi].
- Remove Direct3D abstraction layer. Introduce dynamic_module [Giuseppe Gorgoglione].
- Reverse-engineered Moto Frenzy security FPGA and implemented decryption code [Morten Shearman Kirkegaard, Samuel Neves, Peter Wilhelmsen].
- Make filesel current path clickable [Nathan Woods].
- terminal: Fixed Color configuration [Nigel Barnes].
- Memory fun: * Added AM_SELECT/addrselect field.  Replaces the old AM_MIRROR/AM_MASK combo used to mirror a handler and get the mirrored bits in the offset * Removed mask and/or mirror from where it didn't belong. Simplified a lot of instances of mask that just weren't needed, especially in bus handlers. Used the short forms of install handlers where possible.
 * Replaced the 60s hippy, "It's cool man" range parameter handling in map_range that tried to guess what was meant when the values passed were not entirely sensible, by a cranky, diner waitress-turned IRS auditor curmudgeon. Main control function has a series of 14 tests just to find a reason to fatalerror out your requests. You have been warned [O.Galibert].
- Fixed double hyphen in -pipe [belegdol].
- eeprom: Not a device_memory_interface [O. Galibert].
-intelfsh, i2cmem: Not a device_memory_interface either [O. Galibert].
- Add basic SPARCv7 core [Ryan Holtz].
- tms57002: I hadn't yet understood some of the, err, subtleties of the memory subsystem [O. Galibert].
- Improve SPARC disassembler: * Support SPARCv9 * Allow plug-in ASI comments * Fix format of some opcodes * Produce clr synthetic * Allow running in v7, v8 and v9 modes * Fix addcc/andcc in SPARCv7 mode and simplify integer op tables * Allow ASI descriptions to be supplied with MCFG macro * VIS I (UltraSPARC) and II (UltraSPARC III) support * VIS 2+, VIS 3 and VIS 3B support * Add several SPARC models to unidasm [Vas Crabb].
- Rewrite SPARC emulation based on detailed descriptions from SPARC manual [Ryan Holtz].
- Load save state preparations: * A number of changes and refactorings in preparation for a new load/save state menu. Most notably, I am C++-ifying osd_directory (now osd::directory) and changing osd_stat() to return std::unique_ptrosd::directory::entry * Take note that this change completely omits POSIX support, simply because I lack a development environment to support it. This will have to be done by someone else [Nathan Woods].
- POSIX implementation for new directory read features, cleanup of Windows implementation, return directory handle as smart pointer, fix full build [Vas Crabb].
- Supply modified time for files in archives [Vas Crabb].
- Fix LDUH, LDSH, LDUHA, and LDSHA opcodes in the SPARC core [Ryan Holtz].
- ImGui debugger improvements: * Memory views now control their own position, removing the scrollbar, allows finer control of large memory areas * Pressing Enter on an empty debugger console input now does a single step * Disassembly and Memory expression inputs now auto-select all * Fix various key inputs * Send character inputs to views, allowing memory editing to be possible in a memory window * Show a rectangle around the view with focus * Add history functionality (press up/down in the debugger console input widget) * Allow log windows and debugger console scrollbars to stay at their maximum value, if moved there [Barry Rodewald].

0.174:

- Make watchdog timer a separate device [AJR].
- NetBSD fix, from pull request #852 [Thomas Klausner].
- Update to LZMA 16.0 [Vas Crabb].
- Continuing work to move object initialization from start to constructor. Removed family_t. All of this can be determined at runtime from object as well. As part of this, the "template" to write devices has changed. Converted a number of devices to use the new template [Couriersud].
- All netlist devices now follow new syntax. Removed dead code. All sub devices are now forced to be initialized in the constructor. Device setup now completely in constructor. Removed start call [Couriersud].
- Added tons of Thomson software to softlists [Reagan Roush].
- emumem: Get rid of the install_* return value [O. Galibert].
- UML: Added TZCNT instruction (Trailing Zero Count) [Ville Linde].
- DirectInput8: Correct joystick polling methods to better support older joysticks which previously only worked with DirectInput7 [Quench].

0.173:
======
- Bugfix #04965: [Interface] Games with no screen produce no "final.png" with -STR [Osso].
- Bugfix #06170: [Compiling] OpenMP: OpenMP-enabled builds of MAME 0.172 fail to compile [Jind?ich Makovi?ka].
- Bugfix #06019: [Interface] Wrong default bios outputted with -listxml command [dankan1890].
- Bugfix #06173: [Core] All software saving SRAM: Software loaded outside of software list (e.g. -cart PATH_TO_ROM) fails to save SRAM [dankan1890].
- New Android icon images [JacKc].
- Compressed internal layouts [David Haywood].
- TMS5220/5110 merge Part 1 [Lord Nightmare].
- Iterate over core classes C++11 style [AJR].
- Borrow string processing code from ui.cpp so that £ works in layouts (using UTF-8 encoding at least) [David Haywood].
- Updated sc4fd7tha.lay with UTF8 encoding of £ sign [Krick].
- Recognize the full range of controller inputs [AJR].
- Redump leapstertv [Team Europe]
- Initial Catalan translation [jmallach].
- Reduce the incidence of required_device<palette_device> in subdevices [AJR].
- UML: Added FCOPYI and ICOPYF instructions to pass raw data between integer and floating-point registers [Ville Linde].
- screen: svg rendering from inside the rom [O. Galibert].
- Updated Portuguese (Brazil) [Ashura-X].
- luaengine: Add plugin options menu [Carl].
- TMS5220: add a 'combined rs/ws write' function for systems which require both pins to change at exactly the same time and not to reset the chip [Lord Nightmare].
- Revert software-installed slot/image options when changing software [AJR].
- Make overscan on integer scaled targets optional (add option -intoverscan) [Calamity].
- luaengine: Direct and region accessors [Carl].
- Add experimental cheat lua plugin [Carl].
- info.cpp: First attempt to fix the longstanding issue about inputs owned by devices being always tagged as P1 inputs in -lx. Improved documentation of input devices in the -listxml output, since having just a generic 'number of buttons' is rather pointless in the context of home systems with configurable controllers (being them keyboards, keypads or joypads). Now the various controllers are listed separately with the number of buttons they have. Frontend authors who relied on the "buttons" attribute of the input node for any kind of filter shall now scan all available controllers and take the maximum among their "buttons" attribute (possibly discarding keyboards and keypads if they want) to recover the old value. Started to acknowledge PORT_16WAY inputs in -lx, since they were reported as 8-ways so far [Fabio Priuli].
- Devfind revision phase 1, cleaning out some legacy stuff * Eliminate the cached device_t::m_region pointer and its region() getter method. Devices that need to bind to a region with the same tag should use optional/required_memory_region or optional/required_region_ptr with DEVICE_SELF as the subtag; this improves error checking. (DEVICE_SELF has been moved to device.h for greater visibility in the source) * Allow required/optional_region_ptr to specify a specific length which must match that of the region found * Implement finder_base::finder_tag() getter for diagnostic purposes * Perform some (not very efficient) validity checks on memory region finders instead of allowing them to automatically pass * Privatize device_memory_interface::m_addrspace [AJR].
- plugins/timer: Add sample plugin for game time [Carl].
- plugins/cheatfind: start lua cheat finder library [Carl].
- Basic TCP server based on libuv [Inaki Baz Castillo, Miodrag Milanovic].
- Skeleton implementation for Universal windows main app classes [Brad Hughes].
- String Translate for Chinese (Traditional / Simplified) [YuiFAN].
- diimage.cpp: Allow image devices to be configured with a fixed (not user selectable) piece of software and updated a few options and menu to acknowledge such possibility [Fabio Priuli].
- macs.cpp: Converted to use generic cartslot with fixed software configuration. Cleaned up loading and banking systems in the driver as a result [Fabio Priuli].
- Added extra bit as delay between bytes to make 1 stop bit work [Joakim Larsson].
- am9517: Add clone with the non-standard mask behavior of the PC Transporter ASIC [Carl, R. Belmont].
- screen: Fix alpha handling, cdkong looks good now [O. Galibert].
- bgfx: Add data-driven render target clearing [Ryan Holtz].
- Significant speed improvement: * Added a new solver using compressed row format * Fixed sorting. As a result, netlist performance on kidniki nearly doubled. The performance increase is mainly due to the fact that sorting decreases the number of operations for gaussian elimination of the kidniki matrix from ~7800 to 707. In addition, compressed row format improves L1 usage [Couriersud].
- Eliminate device_t::static_config, a type-unsafe legacy feature: * Rewrite or remove every last instance of MCFG_DEVICE_CONFIG and its two aliases, including within comments and dead code * Make the Z80/Z180 daisy chain an interface that interfaces with the existing interface. Z8000 has been hooked up to this as well (p8000_16 already configures it), but currently does nothing with it [AJR].
- mips3: Fixed interpreter bug where BADCOP exceptions would execute the faulting opcode twice [Ryan Holtz].
- Update strings.po [aviloria].
- Update German GUI translation [rootfather].
- Added ImGui based debugger [Barry Rodewald].
- Added HQ2x, HQ3x and HQ4x shaders [Jules Blok, Cameron Zemek, Maxim Stepin].
- Soft is hard and hard is soft. Two is one and one is two. No wonder "-video accel" has substandard performance if opengl is disabled [Couriersud].
- These init calls all returned false. No need for a return value in this case [Couriersud].
- Iterate over devices C++11 style [AJR].
  Replace the old device_iterator and its specialized versions with functionally equivalent classes that use standard operators to yield references to devices/interfaces rather than pointers. With range-based for loops, they no longer have to be stored in named variables, though they can also be reused concurrently since the iteration state is now maintained by a subclass. Add a few more typical getters to device_t::subdevice_list.
- bgfx: Added SuperEagle shader [Ryan Holtz].
- Refactored distortion pass: * Separated curvature parameter into distortion, cubic_distortion and distort_corner * Distortion and cubic_distortion can be negative, to compensate each other * Distort_corner is intependent from the image distortion [ImJezze].
- Refactor OSD window: Unified renderer in osd_window as std::unique_ptr Made windows all std::shared_ptr<window_type> Made window lists std::list<std::shared_ptr<window_type>> Updated OSD SDL worker_param to not use malloc (not compatible with smart pointers) Made renderer pointer to window a weak reference. May not be available during destruction of the window [Brad Hughes].
- Split UI and frontend part from core [Miodrag Milanovic].
- Implemented dynamic loading of precompiled solver code [Couriersud].
- softlist.cpp: Add support for "rom_ignore" [Fabio Priuli].
- Added "selection" parameter to chain input sampler: * If specified all textures (.png) within the same directoy of the given texture will be selectable via slider in the UI * Also added slider for "shadow mask tile mode" to HLSL chain [ImJezze].
- bgfx: Ported xBR shaders from libretro [Ryan Holtz, Hyllian].
- Archive handling improvements: * Improve error handling in 7zip file I/O code * Fix reading 7zip files >=4GB on LP32/LLP64 targets * Update to LZMA SDK to 15.14, supports new 7zip features * Stop relying on local hacks to LZMA SDK * Support most ZIP64 features excluding directory compression * Support LZMA-compressed files in ZIP archives * Support Info-ZIP UTF-8 file name fields * Fix phantom files/directories when browsing archives * Report archive handling errors [Vas Crabb].
- Update to expat 2.1.1 for security and bug fixes [Vas Crabb].

0.172:
======
- Added data-driven shader system for BGFX renderer [Ryan Holtz].
  * Allows an arbitrary number of passes, with arbitrary connections between passes.
  * Ships by default with three effects: default, unfiltered, and hlsl.
  * default: Simple bilinear stretch.
  * unfiltered: Simple nearest-neighbor stretch.
  * hlsl: A close reimplementation of the Direct3D HLSL shaders. Does not currently support bloom or vectors.
  * Select the "shader chain" you wish to use with -bgfx_screen_chains.
  * Adjust the settings to your liking with slider controls, saving and loading settings and presets will be added in a future version.
  * See bgfx/chains/hlsl.json ans bgfx/hlsl/blit.json for JSON format rules.
  * For additional information, see the official MAME documentation.
- Improved Scanline Simulation [ImJezze]:
  * Changed the amount of scanline darkness, a setting of 1.0 now becomes fully black (to get the same result as before, halve your current setting).
  * Scanline height now depends on the brightness of the underlying color.
  * The amount of the scanline brightness and overdrive now depends on the scanline darkness.
  * Renamed 'Scanline Screen Height' to 'Scanline Screen Scale' and 'Scanline Indiv. Height' to 'Scanline Height'.
  - Fixed Bloom Level Alignment:
    * Fixed target dimensions of bloom levels, which results in much better alignment, especially for games with very low resolutions. Therefore, current bloom settings might appear less intense than before.
  - Quality and Performance improvements:
    * HLSL now uses non-power-of-two-sized target surfaces (breaks compatibility with graphics cards based on R300/R400/NV30 and older).
    * HLSL target surfaces now have the size of the screen canvas.
    * Removed HLSL pre-scale factor.
    * HLSL now uses a sharp bilinear interpolation to pre-scale textures to screen canvas size, based on [Themaister]'s implementation.
    * Improved overall performance. Based on the previously required pre-scale factors, speedups range 5-50% depending on graphics hardware, more if a higher prescale factor was used.
    * Improved shadow mask quality (pixel-perfect) in screen-mode.
    * Fixed half source texel offset of bloom level alignment.
    * Removed ./hlsl/artwork_support folder.
    * All shaders after pre-scale are now based on screen coordinates (workaground until both raster and vector passes can work on texture coordinates).
    * Disabled distortion shader for more than one screen and for artworks in full mode, does not affect artworks in cropped mode (workaground until both raster and vector passes can work on texture coordinates).
- UI [Maurizio Petrarota]
  * Enabled user interface navigation through UI_CONFIGURE button (tab key by default).
  * Added support for "covers" images collection.
  * Added support for "gameinit.dat".
  * Improved ROM-less checking at startup.
  * Improved vertical orientation rendering.
  * Fixed missing mouseover highlight.
  * Fixed search in software lists.
  * Fixed DATs reload after path changes.
  * Fixed software load failure from BIOS submenu.
- Bloom refactoring [ImJezze]
  * Calculation of bloom dimensions is now done only once, when render target is created.
  * Reduced blur width for non-vector screens.
  * Implemented shadow UV option for source tile mode.
- Type-safe C++ printf analog and vector-backed iostreams [Vas Crabb]
  * Supports most C99, glibc, SUS and MSVCRT format specifications.

======
- Making logerror part of machine and device classes display tag of device that logged message [Miodrag Milanovic].
- TMS5xxx: Fix for occasional audio 'spike' instability/wraparound glitches caused by improper truncation in the lattice filter multiplier. This is not an optimal fix as it isn't correct to hardware, but it works better than the previous approximation [Lord Nightmare].
- Fix all instances of PVS-Studio warning V578, "An odd bitwise operation detected. Consider verifying it".
- (hdc92x4) Fix ambiguity of ?: operator flagged by PVS-Studio. Fix PVS-Studio warning V562, "It's odd to compare a bool type value with a value of 0/1". Fix PVS-Studio warning V564, "The &/| operator is applied to bool type value. You've probably forgotten to include parentheses."
- TMS5220 and TMS5110: Add more verbosity to DEBUG_LATTICE [Lord Nightmare].
- OSD/SDL: add missing header to fix build on NetBSD. The file was removed from the other gmake.*/genie.make files. The build/gmake.* files do not exist upstream, so this is a purely local problem [Thomas Klausner].
- (mc6845) Fixed hd6845 rasters in interlace mode: BBC now uses correct hd6845; saa5050 outputs all 20 scanlines [Nigel Barnes].

Fixed reset of HLSL settings * Fixed bug that resets the HLSL settings when the screen size has changed * Removed hardcoded HLSL presets * Updates HLSL readme * Fixed creation order of D3D and HLSL resources * Sliders will be hidden when toggled off and will be shown when toggled on again * Screen adjustment (scale, offset) can now be handled by the respective render API itself (default behavior is as before) * D3D (if HLSL) is activated handles screen adjustment by itself within the shader, which fixes the odd behavior of some effects (e.g. round corners) when screen scale and offset is used * Fixed bug that resets the HLSL settings when switching between window mode and fullscreen * Fixed changed screen adjustment for multi screens * The vector renderer now tries to detect a invariabel vector intensity and disables the calculation of a dynamic beam width * Fixed not used HLSL settings from <custom>.ini if MAME was started without driver parameter * Removed default values from HLSL sliders, the defaults here are more like null values to hint when an effect would be disable * Slightly changed default HLSL settings * Fixed missing shadow mask texture when switching between window mode and full screen [ImJezze].
- wozfdc: Warp factor 4 Scotty (much less CPU usage now!) [O. Galibert].
- Updated OS/2 support for GEnie and MAME [KO Myung-Hun].
- Allow for Emscripten compile to JavaScript out of the box. MAME can now be built using Emscripten's 'emmake' tool, e.g. like so: emmake make SUBTARGET=pacman SOURCES=src/mame/drivers/pacman.cpp. This should produce a .js file which can be supplied to an HTML front-end [Justin Kerk].

- TMS5110.c: Finally fixed zpar logic correctly [Lord Nightmare].
- TMS5220: Implemented talk status state machine properly as shown by patent. Got rid of m_target_* hack in favor of loading data from ROM as needed. Fixed ZPAR logic. Fixed pitch zeroing to match(?) patent [Lord Nightmare].
- TMS5220: Purge process() of gotos to hopefully make the compiler's optimizer happier. Add a hack so Victory's "Shields Up" sample and the sample afterward aren't corrupted [Lord Nightmare].
- TMS5110: Purge process() of gotos to hopefully make the compiler's optimizer happier [Lord Nightmare].
- Fixed GetModuleHandle to be universal [Vladimir Kryvian].
- Add skeleton support for K1801VM2 (as clone of T11) and skeleton driver dvk_kcgd that uses it [shattered].

- TMS5220 and TMS5110: Fixed incorrect implementation of pitch zero which caused an improperly long period with no pitch at an interpolation inhibited -> voiced boundary. Moved unvoiced parameter zeroing into the frame parser, as on the original chips. Some minor TALK/SPEN state machine changes as well, which should have minimal effect [Lord Nightmare].
- Added 'global_inputs' (disabled by default) to allow MAME to read inputs even when it doesn't have the focus [Scrooge McClunk].
- 315-5124.c: Minor changes and fix a regression that in theory could affect zoomed sprites in TMS9918 modes [Enik Land].

- Sega 837-14645 JVS I/O dumped [Darksoft].
- Add correct CD2802 chirp rom from decap [Sean Riddle].
- UTF8 support for pstring. Opted for a scalable solution which should be easily extensible to utf16 and utf32 as well. All position related operations now operate on char code positions instead of byte positions [Couriersud].
- chihiro.c: Move parts common with Xbox console into their own files machine/xbox.c and includes/xbox.h [Samuele Zannoli].
- Replaced the frame parse and speech generation code from tms5110.c with the code from tms5220.c, should be significantly more accurate and allow the cores to be much more easily merged in the future. This also allowed finally getting rid of the COEFF_ENERGY_SENTINEL hack in tms5110r.inc [Lord Nightmare].
- Fix interpolation on TMS52xx to match samples from real chip [PlgDavid, Lord Nightmare].
- tms51xx: Removed target_x variables in favor of reloading from coefficient ROM during the generation loop (as the real device does). Implemented proper ZPAR and unvoiced ZPAR logic for zeroing parameters during idle and unvoiced frames. Changed the pitch zeroing logic during frame inhibit to last an entire interpolation period rather than one sample. Replaced the speech-is-synthesizing state machine with the original patent TALK, TALKD and SPEN bits. Redid the talk_status logic to use (TALKD || SPEN) as the real device does [Lord Nightmare].
- floppy.c: Added drive sounds (must be activated in drivers using MCFG_FLOPPY_DRIVE_SOUND(true); quite simple still, same sounds for all drives) [Michael Zapf].

  * std=c++98 -Wall -Wpedantic -Wextra -Wno-long-long -Wno-variadic-macros and
  * std=c++11 -Wall -Wpedantic -Wextra [Couriersud].
- Added macro object registration and dynamic includes to netlist. This allows the creation of macro libraries going forward. Any IC which can be described by a truthtable and a package wrapper can now be entirely described in netlist syntax [Couriersud].
- Identify size_t usage in printf by enclosing the argument in SIZET_PRINTF(). This is typesafe, can be identified and allows to use proper 64bit computing with compilers up to it [Couriersud].
- winfile.c: Stop crashing after saving to a disk image loaded from a software list [Curt Coder].
- Commodore VIC-1515 printer [Curt Coder].
- Commodore VIC-1520 plotter [Jim Brain, Curt Coder].
- Added nlwav to tools. nlwav converts netlist logs into wav files. Example usage:
 ./nlwav -i netlist.log_RO.1.log -o tt.wav
 ./nlwav -h [Couriersud].
- Commodore 1526/MPS-802/4023 printer [Curt Coder].
- 315_5124.c: Avoid saving the dynamic RAM used for temp rendering, the save state system does not currently agree with RAM that gets reallocated at
 run time which was happening whenever the resolution changed.
- sm510: Initial Sharp SM510 MCU core [hap].
- Some additional famiclone BIOS sets [Team Europe].

0.163:
======
- (mips3): Make fast RAM handling faster by caching certain values.
- Allow compiling with shared libraries Put SHLIB=1 in the main makefile, or on the command line [O. Galibert].
- Fix Game Blaster emulation, now working [balrog].
- Fix game Blaster compatibility in sb1.0 [balrog].
- cheat: Improved cheat support for games in softlist. XML cheats for home systems should now be stored in a subfolder (or a compressed archive), named after the software list, inside the cheatpath. This allows for loading cheats for consoles / home computers without interfering with arcade cheats when games have identical shortnames. For instance, loading Galaga in NES allows now to use its specific cheats even if a galaga.xml is available in the arcade cheat.7z (previously you'd get an error due to the arcade cheat referring to a cpu not present in the NES) [Pugsy, Fabio Priuli].
- Solved the great Sherwood Forest mystery. DOS 3.3 inserts a short (3-4 cycles, roughly equivalent to one bit) delay between writing the header and the data bytes in the sector data block [Peter Ferrie, Olivier Galibert, Richter Belmont].
- Fixed superbug explosion overlay [SoltanGris42, Couriersud].
- Changed the way NETLIST_START(NAME) is located and called. This is done now solely by using a netlist_sources_t class. Netlist users just register sources like memregions, hardcoded strings, compiled netlists. Going forward this enables to eventually put macro model librariers into roms. The improvement comes with a price. Compiled netlists to be included must now be registered using LOCAL_SOURCE [Couriersud].
- Fixed .lst files whitespace problem [LnmVolbo].
- (mos6526): Fixed port A/B read [geecab].
- Gameshark is a clone of Action Replay [Andrea Petrucci].
- Fixed a number of bugs: * Proxy savestates * Solver savestates * 7490 both counts firing at the same time bug fix. and changed timed list to be resizable [Couriersud].
- floppy: Ensure that get_next_transition always provide the next transition [O. Galibert].
- Added OPT_FLAGS back [Belegdol].
- Added the ability to use system flac, jpeg, lua, sqlite3, portmidi and zlib based on wallyweek's work This brings the system lib capabilities back to where they were prior to build system rewrite [Julian Sikorski].
- Added new SDL_INI_PATH flag [Cesare Falco].
-From 45% to 60% to 99%. That's the improvement achieved for a 89x89 audio matrix mostly solved by elimination. Cleaned up some code as well [Couriersud].
- Added a GMRES solver to netlist. The generalized minimal residual method ist certainly more modern than Gaussian elimination and Gauss-Seidel. However, more the current maximum matrix (KidNiki, 89x89) a combination of Gauss-Seidel to solve for maximum one step to catch quasi-stable conditions and fall-back to optimized Gaussian elimination (for sparse matrix) outperforms GMRES by up to 100% [Couriersud].
- Netlist code now uses "namespace netlist". At the same time, moved all devices int netlist::devices namespace [Couriersud].
- GLSL: Unlimit shader file size [R. Belmont].
- (tms5110.c) and (tms5220.c): Fix missing cast for chirp/excitation values, fix a potential off-by-one for tms5110.c as well [Lord Nightmare].
- (info.c): Worked around missing sub-devices in -lx output [Fabio Priuli].
- Missing GameCube edition roms added [Andrea Petrucci].
- Completely integrated the GMRES solver into netlist solver templatesand recoded it from scratch. GMRES now runs at 122% (kidniki), that's a real proement from 60% before. AT the same time, the code should be easier to read and closer to the GMRES algorithm. Ultimately, kidniki will not use this solver but instead use some frontiers to keep it playable. But going forward, for larger matrices this solver is an opton [Couriersud].
- Properly emulate the double PCB stack system32 games with shared RAM bridge board (Air Rescue and F1 Exhaust Note).

- Added a lot of findings and docs to the WMS driver. These are video slots identified as WMS 360 / 550. Also added the proper crystals, correct CPU, frequency, preliminary memory map, 2 new sets, and technical info [Roberto Fresca].
- Added Seiko Epson E0C6200 cpu emulation [hap].
- Started on Mitsubishi MELPS 4 cpu emulation [hap].
- WMS driver... Hooked the Analog Devices ADSP-2105 CPU (still need proper memory maps). Added technical notes [Roberto Fresca].
- Netlist: * Improved 9312 device ==> 20% speed increase * Remove netlist_state_t ==> no added value * Removed dead code in solver * Various minor modifications* Performance monitoring now also displays stats for subdevices * Fixed save-state issues * Fixed save state in 9312 * Added EXTCLOCK which can generate arbitrary timing patterns * Use two EXTCLOCKs to replace timing circuit (9316) in breakout.

- Downsizing ... Removed netlist_ttl_input_t and netlist_ttl_output_t. The logic family is governed by the chip and defaults to TTL. However
 individual devices may change the logic family of their inputs and outputs as well. Implementing special output/input characteristics of  "S", "LS", "HC", ... you name it, devices is now pretty easy. Theoretically e.g. a "LS_HighPrecision" proxy could be used to model the output down to the transistor level [Couriersud].
- HLSL shader improvements: * Changed shadow mask implementation, shadow count XY now represent the number of pixel the shadow UV sized tiles will take on the screen * Implemented rotation of the shadow mask texture depending on the default landscape or portrait view of the screen * Removed prescale and pixel border of the shadow mask texture * Added option to change the shadow UV offset, to reduce the color bleeding of the shadow mask * Adjusted presets to work with the changed mask implementation.
  * Reduced defocus offset * Improved downsampling for better blurring * Improved alignment of bloom layers (raster and vector).
  * Applied bloom effect to the render output of screenshot and AVI recording * Changed curvature effect to fit screen size * Changed scanlines to be not rendered into bloom layers * Changed shadow mask to be not rendered into bloom layers * Changed color floor to not light the bloom layers * Changed shadow mask to not dark the color floor * Added image vignetting simulation and option * Added round screen corner simulation and option * Added screen light reflection simulation and option * Made usage of unused brightness offset (additive) * Removed unused pincushion option * Removed duplicate shadow count Y options * Removed artwork/adapture.png * Added artwork/adapture-grill.png * Added artwork/shadow-mask.png * Added artwork/slot-mask.png * Added hlsl/simple.fx * Removed unused shaders::blit() function * Added shaders::screen_pass() function, which handles the (raster-)rendering on screen, into screenshot and AVI recording * Added effect: set_bool() function * Fixed usage of OrientationSwapXY shader parameter  * Added RotationSwapXY shader parameters to consider the user defined screen rotation * Added missing RotationSwapXY shader paramter * Fixed curvature zoom to fit the screen size in any aspect ratio * Fixed black border on the right and bottom side of the screen, caused by the previously added rounded corners [Jezze].
- Update palette in 315_5124.c [nitrofurano].
- Netlist: * Fixed soft reset due to wild BJT_SW oscillations * Downsized nld_signal.h to one template * Some minor changes improving performance by some notches * Always compile nl_asserts to avoid bit rot * Adjusted monitor gain for breakout [Couriersud].
- Added netlist-level parameter NETLIST.USE_DEACTIVATE. Device deactivation optimisations can now be enabled within the netlist provided the circuit can deal with them [Couriersud].
- Some netlist bugfixes: * Savestate works * Truthtable device deactivation fixed * Truthtable ignore mask is now determined by a better approach identifying more ignore possibilities [Couriersud].
- savquest: WIP * Hooked up Voodoo 2 device * Switched to DS12885 device for proper CMOS size * Moved Voodoo register base to proper place * Implemented Voodoo-specific PCI registers to pass Glide validation * Increased frame-buffer size to enable 640x480 resolution * Hooked up ISA bus and SoundBlaster 16 device * Extended HASP emulation to return product information* Documented HASP behaviour [Peter Ferrie].
- TLCS-90 CPU: Fixed TRUN bit masking (timers start/stop) [Rainer Keuchel].

- Fixed writing to disk with the Commodore 2040/3040/4040 and 1541/1551/1570/1571 drives [Curt Coder].
- (fdc_pll): Added write_next_bit_prev_cell() that writes a bit at the position the previous bit was read from. This is needed for FDC's that read and write on the same clock cycle, e.g. the Commodore 8050 and Victor 9000 [Curt Coder].
- Update Victor 9000 keyboard diagram [Lord Nightmare].
- Fix VSM rom read through the tms51xx, and add tms6100 hookup to tispeak.c, fixing speech in speak and spell and speak and math. The drivers are usable but no display yet. Fixed speak and spell clock speed (it is 1/2 the clock input of the tms51xx chip) [Lord Nightmare].
- Add a TEA1002 color encoder device and use it for the Aquarius. It might make sense to make this a direct descendent of the palette_device instead. Color information based on TEA1002 datasheet [Dirk Best, nitrofurano, Bruce Abbott].

- Support ProDOS-order Pascal 1.3 images [R. Belmont].
- Support PET user port "CB2 Sound" device [R. Belmont].
- tapectrl.c: Fixed bug where systems with multiple cassette drives (e.g. PET) had no Tape Controls when no cassette was loaded in the first drive [Fabio Priuli].
- ui.c: added shortcut commands for Tape Start and Tape Stop, by default mapped to F2 and Shift+F2, respectively. This is not meant as a replacement for the internal Tape Control menu, but it shall make simpler the usage of game tapes in home computers. Notice that REC/RWD/FWD have still to be pressed from the internal UI and that if you mount multiple cassettes in a driver with multiple tape drives only the first one will be controllable with these shortcuts [Fabio Priuli].
- pc_vga: Correct access to attribute register when PAS bit is set, allows XFree86 to detect ISA VGA [Peter Ferrie].
- maria.c: Timeout rendering added [Mike Saarna]. Reorganized DMA penalties to support new rendering code [Mike Saarna, Robert Tuccitto].

- Added PC-9821AP2/U8W BIOS [caius].
- floppy.c: Fixed disks not being launched if loaded from softlist through File Manager [Fabio Priuli].
- 315_5124.c: Refactored sprite handling, fixes status bar on Tarzan for gaemgear. Removed m_collission_buffer member variable. Tweaked game
 gear timing to fix glitches in status bar of Chicago Syndicate for gamegear [Enik Land].
- maria.c: Verious update: Improved DMA accuracy * Last Line DMA value corrected to 6. GCC and Atari docs both show a difference between Other Line and Last Line as +6 at the lowest part of the range * Blank scanlines are drawn when DMA is off, like real hardware * If MARIA hits the DMA limit, the CPU doesn't run until the next scanline [Mike Saarna, Robert Tuccitto].

0.154:
======
- Added preliminary keyboard hook-up in AAKART device, adding bare-bones keyboard inputs to Acorn Archimedes [Angelo Salese].
- dec_lk201.c : KEYCODE_2 corrected. RIGHT CONTROL now triggers DO [Bavarese].

- (kb3600) More sensible multi-key handling, now actually behaves like H/W [R. Belmont].
- (amigafdc) Add writing [O. Galibert]
-  Core changes: * Save screen pixelclock * Call reset_partial_updates() in finish_screen_updates() instead of creating an extra timer for it. This prevents calling reset_partial_updates() after finishing the screen, causes issues when screens change their size to a size lower than the current screen * Optimization: Support calling vblank_begin() directly at the start of a frame instead of using a timer.
- (c8050) Added ROM signatures for 901483-04 [Paul Rickards, Mike Naberezny].
- osdcore: Allow "default" for -midiin and -midiout [R. Belmont].
- (vtvideo.c) Finally fix smooth scrolling (ED084 =1). See DIAG DISK -> VIDEO TEST -> screen 3 (Rainbow driver - SKIP 0) [Bavarese].
- (corvushd) Fixed prep mode verify drive command. The verify drive command (0x07) is used by the "format check" options of both the Corvus diagnostics program and the SSE HardBox configure program. Previously, format check would halt with an error because we did not return a valid response for the verify drive command. Format check now completes successfully and reports no bad sectors. Fixed get drive parameters command. The "read controller code version" option in the Corvus diagnostics program now shows the correct version and drive capacity. Prep mode now supports multiple drives. This allows the Corvus diagnostics program to format any drive. Previously, the drive id sent in the command to enter prep mode was ignored and drive 1 would always be formatted instead [Mike Naberezny].
- (vtvideo): Added new interlaced mode. Also handle cases where undocumented delays/skip lines are poked (SQUINT; VIDEO.PAS) [Bavarese].

0.153:
======
- Converted x68000 keyboard into a separate serial device. This allows the removal of the uart hle in the driver (which didn't work, it was always two characters behind). diserial cannot sync with the start bit properly when using an external clock, so for now I've added a hack that is only enabled when using the MC68901 (setting the flag ignores the extra spurious bit that was getting shifted in) [smf].
- Replicator 1 driver: * Status: no sound / not working * General skeleton * Basic memory mapping * Shift-register interfacing from PORTC writes to the LCD device * avr8 fuses configuration [Felipe Sanches].
- ISA bus can now use its own address spaces instead of taking over a CPU's [R. Belmont].
- pc_vga: default DAC mask to 0xff, indiana now shows text [Carl].
- i8530h31 now *almost* boots or at least make some beeps, instead of halting because of unmapped I/O accesses, or halting because of a bad checksum because the ROM was loaded improperly [alegend45].
- Floppy subsystem documentation checkpoint. Incomplete, but there's too many people looking at it not to push it [O. Galibert].
- pc/xt/at: Added basic implementation of the Programmers Development System ISA card. The PDS editor software requires the hardware present to start up.  Some core work will need to be done to get any communications working, however [Barry Rodewald].
-Apple drivers cleanup: * apple3_state is no longer an unnecessary subclass of apple2_state * ay3600 keyboard decoder is now independent from apple2_state * Cleaned up some includes [R. Belmont].
- Refactored the Commodore 1541/1551/1571/2031 disk drives to use the modern floppy system [Curt Coder].
- Refactored the Commodore 2040/3040/4040 disk drives to use the modern floppy system [Curt Coder].

- Floppy: Fix write over the index pulse and flux change lookup before it [O. Galibert].
- vtvideo.c: First steps to mimic soft scrolling. Should be synchronized with beam or DMA in the future [Bavarese].
- snapquik.c: Stop unloading snapshot/quickload images after start. This makes these image devices consistent with other image devices and it allows snapname and savename options to work as users expect with these formats too [Fabio Priuli].
- Preliminary driver support for the HP 49 G [Antoine Mine]
- pce_cd: Fixed MSM volume [Osso].
- Attempt to partially rewrite AAKART, and added 4bpp video mode for Acorn Archimedes. It now boots at prompt screen, and actually even boots into splash screen and dies almost soon with an error if you provide a properly initialized NVRAM [Angelo Salese].

0.152:
======
- southbridge: Make at586 fdc work [Carl]

- mc1502: Cassette output, printer WIP, serial WIP, minor keyboard fix [shattered].
- RSP SIMD changes: * Converted high and middle accumulator slices into SIMD vectors * Converted flag registers into SIMD vectors * Fixed unaligned accesses in CFC2 opcode * Added SCALAR_GET_VS1, SCALAR_GET_VS2, and SET_ACCUM_H/M/L to act as a passthrough to either the non-SIMD implementation or individual element insert/extract ops in order to minimize #if USE_SIMD all over the place * Ported SIMD implementations of VMUDL, VMUDM, VMUDN, VMUDH, VMACF, VMACU, VMADL, VMADM, VMADN, and VMADH from CEN64 with permission * Resulted in an overall speedup of proximately 50% for RSP-bound scenes on a 2.5GHz i5 [MooglyGuy, Marathon Man].

0.147u2:
========
- Floppy: Random fixes/logging [O. Galibert].
- upd765: Modernize [O. Galibert]. Remaining TODO list:
 * Take WP into account
 * Test the amstrad, implement its observational format (edsk) using pasti as a start. Or find the legendary amstrad IPFs. Or both.
 * Correct read track, the implementation is completely wrong. See previous for testing, it's only used in protections the check the inter-sector gaps.
 * Shake and bake on the amstrad, protections are the best to find bugs in a fdc.
 * Add the scan id commands, but nothing seems to use them.
 * Debug the 2.88M formatting which is unreliable. Fix its IDAM/DAM gap size on formatting too (but that's not what's making it unreliable).
 * Test all the systems that were hit, and fix what needs to be fixed. Beware that multiple problems may happen:
 - upd765 may be wrong
 - The driver may not be working
 - The hookup may be wrong/incomplete (bitrate selection and floppy rpm in particular)
 - The driver may be too limited for the new implementation (the x68k dma device does not handle non-instant dma yet for instance)
 * Report invalid command when appropriate depending on the actual chip emulated
 * Add the russian clones with their real names.
- d88: Reduce the gap3 size from the standard value when the data otherwise won't fit [O. Galibert].
- upd765: Implement LOCK. Fix busy status when seeking. Fix MSR DIO in EXEC phase. Fix the dump regs command, don't exit on unknown commands and add dsr reset [O. Galibert].

========
-upd765.c: Trigger RDY active during reset interrupt for each drive independently so that 4 consecutive Sense Interrupt commands will return the correct status [Curt Coder].
-SoundBlaster: First-pass somewhat naive working version. Autoinit DMA does not work; use sblaster1_0, not 1_5! [R. Belmont].
-New TMS9900 and TMS9995 implementation with proper control line handling and wait state generation. Previous implementation has been renamed and drivers point to the old implementation until they are adapted to the new one [Michael Zapf].

0.146:
======
- Initial work in preparation for some modernization on the whole megadriv.c file, starting with better splitting of actual drivers (megadriv.c, megacd.c, mega32x.c, megasvp.c and megavdp.c) [David Haywood].

0.145u8:
========
- ap2_dsk: added some missing defines and comments and a way to select whether to use lenient (if the address mark contents are sane regardless of whether the checksum byte was good or not) or normal (only if checksum was valid) usage of the address marks. Also switched the default output sector order from prodos order to dos3.3 order, which is slightly more useful. Added a define to switch between the three possible sector orderings: prodos, dos3.3, and logical [Lord Nightmare].
- dfi_dsk.c: fixed a nasty bug when reading df bytes with 0x80 set throwing the timing way off; this makes most disk images decode a whole heck of a lot better. ap2_dsk.c: fixed a nasty array-out-of-bounds access problem if an address mark with an insane sector value in it is read [Lord Nightmare, Phil Pemberton].
- Fixed a logic bug in the dfi header check which surprisingly doesn't come up at all on GCC (compiler bug?) but does happen on clang. Also disabled some accidentally enabled debug code, and handle the case of no index transitions at all properly [Lord Nightmare, Balrog].
- Fix bug found by Clang (behavior *appears* correct but can't verify) [Balrog, R. Belmont].
- 3c505 improvements. Netbooting a MESS Apollo instance off a second MESS Apollo instance is now possible, and Domain/OS 10.4 works [Hans Ostermeyer].

- Modern apple 2 disk decoder for 16-sector disk images implemented using Olivier's new system for floptool. Only supports importing from .dfi 50mhz multi-read x3 images at the moment. [Lord Nightmare, Balrog, Jason Scott, Karsten Scheibler]
- Fix dsk export from floptool so it can work with just one .dfi read instead of needing 3 reads. Tested at 50mhz sampling rate only [Lord Nightmare].
- More work on dfi and apple2 modern disk stuff; most of the auto speed recognition stuff is in the dfi handler now but the actual data scaling to match the internal mfi 200mhz sample rate stream is not done yet. There are also some likely issues with beginnings and ends of index pulses. Brickwall windowing has been implemented for dfi for regeneration of missed transitions from marginal reads as well as discarding of noise. A histogram has been added (disabled by default) for dfi format as well [Lord Nightmare, Phil Pemberton, Balrog].
- Some additional tweaks to ap2 and dfi stuff; disabled the horribly broken load() code in ap2_dsk [Lord Nightmare, Balrog].
- ap2_dsk.c: beginnings of 13-sector format support. gives a warning if you try to read one so far.
- dfi_dsk.c: fix a bug involving offsets read from source file per track which caused an occasional 0xFF byte to end up in the stream (reading off end of file buffer) [Lord Nightmare].
- ap2_dsk now produces valid, runnable ProDOS-order .po disk images [Lord Nightmare, adtpro].

- info.c: Several fixes and additions to listxml output [Fabio Priuli].
- Appended to xml info about devices which can be optionally mounted to slots.
- Added a description attribute to slotoption to show which devices can be mounted in each slot.
- Added to xml info of cpus/inputs/image/slots which are relative to devices (e.g. CPUs or Dipswitches in the device itself).
- Tags of elements directly attached to the root_device do not display anymore the root colon (slot tags were already behaving in this way); elements attached to optional devices use tags starting with colon (to be interpreted as a relative tags which gets appended to the device tag, when such a device is selected in a slot).
- Modified when necessary output routines to pass a root_device and a root_tag as parameters, in order to simplify output of relative devices and avoid duplicated code.
- Updated DTD according to the new elements and attributes. These changes allow frontends to know in advance how drivers can be configured through the various slot options (by matching option descriptions with device descriptions), without the need to run -lx with the various slot combinations. This is especially of use if a device adds e.g. dipswitches or image devices (like additional floppy drives or additional slot expansions), but also if one wants to know e.g. how many sound channels a soundcard would add to a pc driver, or which kind of screen parameters would be added by a specific choice of video card.

- [Windows GUI] Minor bug fixes regarding software listing and CRC calculations with respect to clone and compatible drivers [Nate Woods].
- The core is based on MAME 0.79. This incorporates all features of the update to this core [MAME Team].
- As a consequence of the MAME 0.79 core, which has massive changes to the memory system, there is a greater likelyhood of regressions in this MESS release (as with MAME).
- Internal error reporting enhancements for image loading; still some work to do. Introduced automated messtest testing facility, in order to prevent regressions in the future [Nate Woods].

0.78:
======
- [Windows] Fixed the -writeconfig option; was accidently dropped (bug #492) [Nate Woods].
- The core is based on MAME 0.78. This incorporates all features of the update to this core [MAME Team].

0.77:
======
- Major source code reorg and cleanup; uses new generic floppy and parameter system. When a cassette motor is active, another icon will be displayed indicating whether play or record is set. HOME and DEL now have default natural keyboard bindings, to ASCII values 12 and 8 respectively. For systems that use a key with those values, like the CoCo, this change now enables those keys to be used from the natural keyboard [Nate Woods].
- The core is based on MAME 0.77. This incorporates all features of the update to this core [MAME Team].
- Overhaul on generic floppy and cassette image systems; added new generic parameter layer. Read/write cassette images are now supported. Also moved CoCo, Apple II and PC drivers onto the new floppy system. Note that there is potential for breakage here, but in the long run both of these overhauls will be worth it [Nate Woods].
- Fixed cheat engine [Nate Woods].
- The documentation was gutted and integrated with Paul Vince's easyEmu guide. All of the documentation is now under docs/ in the source tree. Platform specific help now goes in subdirectories like docs/windows and so on [Nate Woods, Paul Vince].
- Added some consistency code to sanity check drivers' extension lists (bug #470) [Nate Woods].
- Drivers now have the ability to add custom disassembler procs, to customize the way the cores disassemble code [Nate Woods].

- Fixed a bug that would cause a hang when parsing certain invalid filenames (for example, D:\FOO\D:\FOO\BAR.ZIP) [Nate Woods].
- Revamped some inputs, added IPT_MOUSE, IPT_START, and IPT_SELECT. The latter two can be used with IPF_PLAYER masks. Also removed legacy IPT_SELECT1-4, and IPT_START1-4 should no longer be used by MESS [Nate Woods].
- Tripled the delay in which wd179x errors are reported. This manifested itself in the CoCo driver by an emulated crash on some versions of NitrOS-9 when run on a write protected image [Nate Woods].

0.71:
======
- [WIN32] Fixed some resizing problems in windowed mode when the system resized the screen (bug #100) [Nate Woods].

0.69:
======
This release was skipped.

0.68:
======
- The core is based on MAME 0.68. This incorporates all features of the update to this core [MAME Team].
- Drivers now have a 'compatible_with' field, that specify drivers that have compatible software but are not mere clones [Nate Woods].
- Devices are now referenced by a mess_image pointer, rather than a type/id pair [Nate Woods].
- Enhanced MESS's natural keyboard facility, so that drivers can specify handlers to bypass keypress simulation [Nate Woods].
- Changed device load and unload so that all devices are loaded before machine init, but not necessarily driver init, in response to a bug (bug #366) [Nate Woods].
- [Windows] Default directories for the file dialogs can now be specified on a device type basis at the command line (e.g. -floppydisk_dir). This option will get written out when launched from the GUI, so that per system directories can be recorded (bug #345) [Nate Woods].
- [Windows GUI] Fixed a bug whereby extra software paths with spaces in them would not be properly persisted (bug #369) [Nate Woods].
- [Imgtool] Enabled support for ti99 disk formats with more than 1600 sectors. Added support for v9t9 and pc99 disk image formats (note that these image formats are supported by imgtool, but not by the ti99 driver) [Raphael Nabet].

0.67:
======
- The core is based on MAME 0.67. This incorporates all features of the update to this core [MAME Team].

- [Win32 GUI] Fixed a bug that caused software specific screenshots to not show up if clicking between tabs [Nate Woods].

0.64:
======
LICENSE CHANGE WARNING: We are considering changing distribution license, switching to GPL for the whole project and LGPL for some CPU and sound cores. If you contributed code to MESS and are against this change, now is the right time to let us know.
- The core is based on MAME 0.64. This incorporates all features of the update to this core [MAME Team].

0.63:
======
This release was skipped.

0.62.1:
========
- New generic code for emulating terminals, now in use by the Apple I and Kaypro drivers [Nate Woods].
- Added the ability to specify a minimum resolution to display a system, in order to better support low resolution drivers [Nate Woods].

0.62:
======
- The core is based on MAME 0.62.  This incorporates all features of the update to this core [MAME Team].
- Added new snapshot/quickload code, to hide the details about loading snapshots and quickloads from the drivers [Nate Woods].
- Added the ability for systems to override the friendly names of devices [Nate Woods].
- [WIN32] Added the ability to toggle the frames per second view, differentiate between soft and hard resets in certain systems, and to save screenshots in the new UI [Nate Woods].

0.61.2:
========
- Updated all drivers device declarations to new system and removed old dev array [Nate Woods].
- New options.disable_normal_ui and osd_trying_to_quit() functions created, to support the new Win32 UI [Nate Woods].
- Added the ability for drivers to support drawing to the UI in a standard way; which helped fix a problem where the tape graphic was lost in MESS 0.61 (bug #270) [Nate Woods].
- [Win32] New user interface replaces old UI; this is on by default but can be disabled with the -nonewui command switch. This new UI uses Windows native menus and should be much easier to use [Nate Woods].
- [Win32] Help file entries for each system now list the directory name expected by MESS [Nate Woods].
- [Win32 GUI] Fixed an incredibly MORONIC bug where RAM preferences were stored as booleans (!?!) rather than integers (bug #260) [Nate Woods].
- [Win32 GUI] Fixed a bug where certain elements in the treeview lost their first character (bug #262) [Nate Woods].

0.61.1:
========
- The MESS core will not automatically open software images in a clone system drivers directory anymore, under the belief that this functionality belongs in the OSD code [Nate Woods].
- All MESS drivers need a SYSTEM_CONFIG (formerly COMPUTER_CONFIG) parameter specified. Also changed the implementation of the SYSTEM_CONFIG_* macros to provide a more flexible system for representing the data. Added the ability for devices to be declared within the SYSTEM_CONFIG block. Consider the older way of declaring devices  deprecated. Added new functions for iterating through devices, in order to better abstract the internal representation of devices:
	device_first()
	device_next()
	device_find()
Also renamed GameDriver dev field to dev_ in order to break any source dependencies on the dev field [Nate Woods].
- Added new memory pool code that implements memory pools that can be freed in one step [Nate Woods].
- Overhaul of code that maintained the list of loaded images; moved to mess/image.[c|h], and changed the prefix of them from device_ to image_ (as opposed to the  device_* calls that are used to access the IODevice structure). Also, implemented these new calls for drivers to use:
	image_malloc()    (similar to auto_malloc(), but for the lifetime of devices)
	image_strdup()    (uses image_malloc() to allocate strings)
	image_exists()    (tests for the existance of a loaded image)
	image_filetype()  (accessor for file extension)
For the most part, there is no longer any reason for MESS drivers to use malloc() and free(), so calls to these should be eliminated over time [Nate Woods].
- Removed IO_RESET_ALL, as it was broken and an ugly hack to begin with (bug #239) [Nate Woods].
- In the opening display software info box, if the filename and the goodname (as determined by CRC) match up, the goodname will not be displayed in order to reduce screen clutter [Nate Woods].
- Removed all calls to device_close(IO_CASSETTE) in system drivers, instead provided a cassette_exit() function that drivers can specify, removing this responsibility from system drivers [Nate Woods].
- Implemented preliminary paste functionality; it attempts to decode the driver's input tables and attempts to create a mapping between ASCII and input signals. This process is far from perfect at this time. In the future, it will be possible for drivers to customize the way that paste works for a more perfect translation [Nate Woods].
- Added new PORT_KEYx macros that should be used in place of PORT_BITX when mapping keyboards. These macros also specify unicode values for the input codes for natural keyboard support [Nate Woods].
- Added a new osd_keyboard_disabled() call.  If this returns non-zero, then the core will supress input of type IPT_KEYBOARD. This is useful if a front end wants to implement a natural keyboard [Nate Woods].
- Added a new osd_parallelize() call, for basic SMP acceleration [Nate Woods].
- Renamed osd_dir.h to osd_mess.h, to further reflect that it is more than just directory calls [Nate Woods].
- [Win32] New -threads parameter, to specify the maximum amount of threads used for osd_parallelize(); defaults to the number of processors in the system [Nate Woods].
- [Win32 GUI] Printers are now treated separately from the other devices; you do not specify printer ouput like you do disk images. Printer output now gets specified in the configuration tab of the system properties. The added benefit is that the same output file can be used repeatedly [Nate Woods].
- [Imgtool] Imgtool floppy drivers can now be "templated"; a driver for a particular file system format can point at a structure that lists allowable disk image  formats. This allows for the addition of new disk image format drivers without touching the imgtool drivers [Nate Woods].
- [Imgtool] Fixed a bug in the FormatDriver handling that caused some file puts to not be properly written [Nate Woods].
- [Imgtool] Added Color Computer DMK disk image support [Tim Lindner].

0.61:
======
- The core is based on MAME 0.61. This incorporates all features of the update to this core [MAME Team].
- Converted numerous drivers to use the auto_malloc() and auto_bitmap_alloc() calls, and also to use generic_bitmapped video calls [Nate Woods].
- Added new videomap code that makes it easy to support arbitrary video modes in a fast, efficient manner. This takes the place of the old rasterbits/rastertrack code; converted m6847, CoCo 3, and Mac video hardware to use videomap [Nate Woods].
- Added a new disk format handling system that allows disk formats to be generically specified in such a way usable by both MESS itself, and imgtool [Nate Woods].
- Fixed a bug in the wave code that could cause a crash if a cassette image is unloaded. Added a [none] entry in the File Manager, that allows the user to unload an image. The file manager will now default to the directory that a preexisting image resides in. Fixed some bugs that caused the battery backups in the NES and GB systems to be placed in odd directories. Added palette_set_colors() function to make it easy to initialize a palette with a predefined list of colors. Readded record/playback support. Added artwork_use_device_art() to the MAME core to support Vectrex style artwork [Nate Woods].
- Fixed bugs #192 and #200 - remember that:
  1) In File Manager you can press SHIFT+ENTER to manually edit a filename
     and CTRL-Y to delete the field.
  2) In the file selector you can edit the file specification and you can use
     SHIFT+UP/DOWN as PgUp/PgDown and
     CTRL+UP/DOWN as Home/End. [Stefano Priore]
- With help from SockMaster, fixed some very subtle timer bugs in the m6809 and hd6309 CPU cores [Nate Woods, tim lindner, John Kowalski].
- New OSD function:

		void osd_device_eject(int type, int id);

  It sets a device image to NULL, as would a device_filename_change(type, id, NULL), but enables osd code to update its osd structures. The mac and lisa drivers will use this function instead of device_filename_change to eject floppy disks. This function is needed because the mac osd code keeps track of each selected file, and the data went out of sync when device_filename_change was called [Raphael Nabet].
- [GUI] Fixed a very minor bug that caused the software list view background to not be updated at the same time as the system list if the snap directory was changed [Nate Woods].

- Fixed a bug that prevented introducing completely new software images when there was already one of that particular image type already loaded [Nate Woods].
- Added some infrastructure for automated tests [Nate Woods].
- Fixed a bug in tape handling that would cause rewind and fast forward to not work if the system was stopping the tape (bug #168) [Nate Woods].
- Added battery_save() and battery_load() functions to abstract handling of battery-backed NVRAM on cartridges [Nate Woods].
- Modified osd_fopen() with OSD_FILETYPE_NVRAM so that the filename parameter can specify subdirectories (for use by battery_save() and battery_load() [Anthony Kruize, Nate Woods].
- [Windows] Fixed a bug in the core that caused the MESS process to not die if the close box was pressed, and the UI was disabled (bug #170) [Nate Woods].
- [Windows] Fixed a bug in the GUI that caused heap corruptions [Nate Woods].
- [Windows] Fixed a bug in the GUI that caused auditing to report BIOS-less console systems as missing BIOSes [Nate Woods].
- [IMGTOOL/Windows] Added wildcard support in the put command, since the Windows shell doesn't do this by default [Nate Woods].
- [IMGTOOL/FAT driver] Fixed bug where files would get stored into a FAT image without forcing the filename to upper case [Nate Woods].
- [MacMESS] Added configurable RAM sizes and dipswitch controls to the MESS tab [Tim Lindner].

- Converted a few drivers (namely Amstrad, Atom, Exidy, Galaksija, Microbee, Microtan, Sord, Spectrum, TI99) to use the new cassette loading APIs [Nate Woods].
- Added new core file (led.c) for display of leds and segmented displays. Also converted Chess Champion drivers to use these calls [Nate Woods].
- On the images screen before emulation starts, only the base name of an image will be displayed (bug 34) [Nate Woods].
- [Windows] Added support for transparent zip paths (e.g. C:\imgs\mule.zip\mule.atr) [Nate Woods].
- Added a call to flopdrv.c to allow the driver to manualy set the number of tracks and sides [Tim Lindner].

- Added "Disk Control" menu to the user interface. With this you can enable/disable a drive (e.g. this is comparable to connecting a disconnecting a drive to the real machine), set write enable/write protect of the disc, and selecting between disc image and real drive access. Real drive access is currently limited to the drivers which use the WD179x, NEC765 and Intel 8271 floppy disc controllers [Kev Thacker].
- Removed hard-coded disk image format in the WD179x code. This floppy disc controller emulation uses the same disk image access as the NEC765 and Intel 8271. It can now support different disk image formats, and as before real discs in a real drive [Kev Thacker].

- Note: .inp record/playback does still not work currently.
- The core is based on MAME 0.37b6. This incorporates all features of the update to this core [MAME Team].
- [DOS] File handling has CHANGED!  heres a brief description: MESS supports a softwarepath= global setting (in the [directories] section of mess.cfg) and this is overrideable per driver (in the [driver] sections) Default for softwarepath= is .;SOFTWARE OSD_FILETYPE_ROM uses the biospath= setting from now on (MAME rompath=) Default for biospath= is .;BIOS. OSD_FILETYPE_IMAGE_R and _RW use the softwarepath= settings from now on, so BIOS ROMs can be kept separate from carts, floppy, harddisk etc. images. The search paths/files are for a hypothetic system driver 'sys':

  extensions of carts for sys = .rom, .bin
  softwarepath = .;x:/software

  mess sys -cart cart

  ./cart
  ./sys/cart
  ./cart.zip containing cart
  ./sys/cart.zip containing cart
  x:/software/cart
  x:/software/sys/cart
  x:/software/cart.zip containing cart
  x:/software/sys/cart.zip containing cart
  ---> assume it failed, because the real extension is .bin
  ./cart.rom
  ./sys/cart.rom
  ./cart.zip containing cart.rom
  ./sys/cart.zip containing cart.rom
  x:/software/cart.rom
  x:/software/sys/cart.rom
  x:/software/cart.zip containing cart.rom
  x:/software/sys/cart.zip containing cart.rom
  ---> still not found, so image_fopen() tries .bin now
  ./cart.bin
  ./sys/cart.bin
  ./cart.zip containing cart.bin
  ./sys/cart.zip containing cart.bin
  x:/software/cart.bin
  x:/software/sys/cart.bin
  x:/software/cart.zip containing cart.bin
  x:/software/sys/cart.zip containing cart.bin

  As you can see it might take quite some time until an image is found, with two directories on the path already, that's why the main softwarepath= setting should be
  short. If you have many, different drives/paths where you store software, you better use the system specific overrides like this:

  [sys]
  biospath=x:/sys
  softwarepath=x:/sys

  [sys2]
  biospath=roms
  sofwarepath=z:/somewhere/sys2

  However, if you have a 'complete set' you would be done (mostly) if you only change the [directories] setting for biospath= and softwarepath= to the drive/path where your mirrored files are. One extension to the searches that might make sense would be to also look into a path/ext/cart.ext directory, that means you could have  subdirectories for eg. dsk, cas, vz, bin or whatever the extensions of the system are [Juergen Buchmueller, Ben Bruscella].

0.37b3 (0.39):
===============
- The core is based on MAME 0.37b3. This incorporates all features of the update to this core [MAME Team].
- Bug fix in wd179x controller [Nate Woods].

from the standard MESS CRC files, the 'crc' command is replaced with 'info'. This new command will return data regarding the image if MESS's CRC files are aware of the
  image. dir and del now can take multiple arguments [Nate Woods].
- Extensive CRC updates [Kurunir, Chris Henry].
- SysInfo.dat documentation update Please send all CRC/sysinfo file contributions to Chris Henry (battlepriest@hotmail.com) [Chris Henry].

0.37b2 (0.38):
===============
- The core is based on MAME 0.37b2. This incorporates all features of the update to this core [MAME team].
- TOOLS: Disk Utility added (mkhdimg.exe) which will create variable sized HD images for use in MESS.  Can create images from 9,216 bytes to 142,606,848 bytes without problems. The Western Digital 1004A that is emulated in MESS is limited to 1024 Cylinders and 16 heads. The sector size is limited to 512
  bytes as well as the sectors per track being limited to 17, this is also due to the WD1004A's limitations [Randy Rains].
- TOOLS: Generic image tool added (imgtool.exe) with the following features: *MAME/MESS style driver architecture; where the image formats are contained in drivers. Currently, the only driver is for CoCo .DSK disk images, but there could be more. Runs on the command line. Commands for listing image  contents, retrieving and storing files. Supports images in .ZIP files. "Engine" is separate from the "shell"; which gives the potential for front ends for
 those who don't like command lines [Nate Woods].

0.37b1 (0.37):
===============
- The core is based on MAME 0.37b1. This incorporates all features of the update to this core [MAME team].
- Alias bug fix [Norberto Alfredo Bensa].
- Systems with no ROMS but a ROM_REGION defined (eg Genesis, NES) are now correctly identified. Clones with no differing roms from the main set are correctly identified (eg. the Laser 210 clones etc.) [David Robertson].
- Extensive CRC updates: SysInfo.dat documentation update [Sean Young, Chris Henry, Gerardo Jorrin, Peter Trauner, Cowering].
- Please send all CRC/sysinfo file contributions to Chris Henry [Thierry Schimbi, Chris Henry, Kev Thacker, Raphael Nabet].

0.36b10:
=========
- The core is based on MAME 0.36b10. This incorporates all features of the update to this core [MAME team].

0.36b9.1:
==========
- [DOS] Now compiled with Allegro 3.9.27 WIP.
- The core is based on MAME 0.36b9. This incorporates all features of the update to this core [MAME team].
- New field in the MachineDriver struct: const char **default_extension. Use this to specify the default file extension for images which  can be used with the system (examples are coleco = "rom", genesis = "bin" or "smd", etc.).
- Filetype definitions for files used in MESS is now IMAGE_R or IMAGE_RW. Note that IMAGE_R replaces ROM_CART, and IMAGE_RW replaces IMAGE.
- Updated CRC database files for a7800, coleco and nes. Added SMS and Gamegear database files. Added System History file (sysinfo.dat). The official maintainer is Chris Henry (battlepriest@hotmail.com). Please send all CRC/History contributions to him.

0.36:
======
- MESS is now developed and distributed as a MAME source override, hence the MESS version number leap ;-). .inp record/playback does still not work currently.
- [DOS] Images specified at the command line must now be accompanied by the device they are to be attached to, and will not be loaded unless the device is specified *and* supported by that system.  Eg, to attach a cartridge for the NES, you must specify: MESS nes -cart galaga.nes. This may affect the usage of frontends, however it brings the MESS command line into sync with the well accepted MAME convention for command line usage.
- Added support to automagically append or replace extensions for files opened with image_fopen(), which means, if opening a given filename fails (also from the optional clone_of parent driver), the code replaces or appends the next available extension and tries again. Therefore, there is no need to  actually supply the file extension to the command line [Juergen Buchmueller].
- The core is based on MAME 0.36 final. This incorporates all features of the update to this core [MAME team].
- New option -listdevices. Use this to obtain valid device names for use at the command line to attach images to the system.
- Extensive CRC updates [Sean Young, Chris Henry, Gerardo Jorrin, Peter Trauner, Cowering]: SysInfo.dat documentation update [Thierry Schimbi, Chris Henry, Kev Thacker, Raphael Nabet]. Please send all CRC/sysinfo file contributions to Chris Henry (battlepriest@hotmail.com).
- Small bug in the 6522 emulator fixed [Gordon Jefferyes].
- Important inclusions for this release: *wave sound interface and IODevice handler *speaker sound driver (replaces the buzzer code) *preliminary file manager *mess_printf() which checks for gui_host. Check the UI (TAB) for handling options for most of the above.
- Generic M6847 code  [Nate Woods].
- Wd179x disk access update.  The correct sector size is now calculated for the nec765 real FDD access.  Now it is calculated from sector size. Loading from real disc works on Enterprise emulator [Kev Thacker].
- void via_set_clock(int which,int clock); added to 6522via.c. This can be called after via_config() to change the clock, otherwise the clock speed of CPU1 is used [Mathis Rosenhauer].
- mess/msdos.c & mess/msdos.h created for MESS DOS specific functions. Note: Each port is now responsible for handling these functions.
- GAME_ALIAS flag added. Use this when specifying a clone system which requires the same romset as another [Juergen Buchmueller].
- System documentation is now contained in sysinfo.dat and sysinfo.htm. Use dat2html to generate sysinfo.htm from sysinfo.dat [Chris Henry, Juergen Buchmueller, Ben Bruscella].
- You can now specify switches on the commandline in which case every image name following them goes to that respective slot, regardless of it's extension.  See mess.txt for some examples [Peter Trauner, Juergen Buchmueller].
- [DOS] New options for IMAGES to be opened, namely OSD_FOPEN_READ, OSD_FOPEN_WRITE, OSD_FOPEN_RW, and OSD_FOPEN_RW_CREATE. Check mess.h for a description of what they are used for. Be sure to use these semantics when handling read/write files [Juergen Buchmueller].
- Slight changes to the PDP1 driver.
- [DOS] TI99 keyboard fix! [Raphael Nabet].
- System ROM (Image) name matched from CRC database file on startup (file stored in CRC directory).
- You can now specify in MESS.CFG the *exact* directory a rom is which you want to run.  no longer necessray to have a directory with the same name as the system [Juergen Buchmueller].
- Zipped cart and image support added. To use, make sure that the zip has the same name as the file in the zip. (eg) for a coleco CART called  "venture.rom", zip to "venture.zip".  When running MESS, type "mess coleco venture.rom". MESS will then load "venture.rom" from "venture.zip". Any system roms can also be zipped and placed anywhere in you ROMPATH coleco.rom in coleco.zip [Ben Bruscella].
- GAME_COMPUTER flag added. Use this to specify that the system requires full keyboard emulation. Emulated Computer systems now use the scroll_lock key to toggle the keyboard emulation. When on, MAME keys (such as "P" for pause) are disabled, until toggled with the scroll_lock [Juergen Buchmueller].
- [DOS] MAKEFILE/compilation changes. To compile MESS, simply make sure you can compile MAME. Then, apply the MESS source over-ride and:
   1. Rename MAKEFILE to MAKEFILE.mm
   2. Rename MAKEFILE.MES MAKEFILE
   3. Type MAKE
- There have been major changes to the Driver structures and loading procedure.
- Here is an overview: Every game driver's struct GameDriver (src/mess/systems/*.c) is now defined using one of four macros COMP/COMPX or CONS/CONSX.
COMP is for computers and CONS is for consoles. The X versions allow specifying additional flags (GAME_NOT_WORKING ect.) Every game driver specifies it's peripherals in an array of "struct IODevice" elements. rom_load and rom_id fields were moved into that list, together with the number of devices and the known file extensions for images of that type. MAME's src/driver.h now only contains one pointer to this list of devices, all of MESS' extra fields are gone.
Old:
#ifdef MESS
    int (*rom_load)(void);
    int (*rom_id)(const char *name, const char *gamename);
    const char **file_extension;
    int num_of_rom_slots;
    int num_of_floppy_drives;
    int num_of_hard_drives;
    int num_of_cassette_drives;
#endif
New:
#ifdef MESS
    const struct IODevice *dev;
#endif
- The global rom_name[], floppy_name[], hard_name[] and cassette_name[] arrays are gone! Instead each machine driver (src/mess/systems/*.c) should specify an init function for every device it supports. This init function is called during the startup with an id (0 to max instances of the device - 1) and a filename. rom_load is called very early when a driver is started. It is the 'init' function for the device type IO_CARTSLOT, so the previous statement applies here too. The rom_id function pointer moved into the struct IODevice too. Every device can have a id function, so if it is possible to identify
eg. a floppy disk, harddisk, cassette ect., you should provide the identifying functions and put them in this field in your systems/driver code. The id function return value is sort of TRUE/FALSE, ie. non zero means image is ok for this device, zero is not recognized. The IODevice contains an "void (*exit)(int id);" entry, so each driver could (and probably should) handle shutting down the various dvice instances. The exit entries are called from src/mess/mess.c exit_devices(), which is called from src/mame.c shutdown_machine(). Startup handling moved from src/mame.c to src/mess/mess.c In the first stage load_image() is called. The images specified on the command line are parsed in mess.c now, and a list of "struct ImageFile" entries in the  GameOptions is set. This struct contains a "char *name" and an "int type", where type should be set to one of the IO_CARTSLOT, IO_FLOPPY ect. values.
GUI ports could use this to store some file selection lists together with the type of files selected. The DOS port stores image names from the command line (*argv) in this array, and the type of image is determined this way: 1st: user specified a type using a switch before a (list of) name(s). For DOS this looks like "mess system -flop test -cart rom1 -cart rom2" 2nd: the extension of the filename matches one of the MessDevice entries of the driver which is started. So if a driver defines "cas" for it's IO_CASSETTE device and "dsk" for it's IO_FLOPPY device, the command line "mess driver a.dsk b.cas" will be sufficient. In the second stage during startup, the get_files() function is called and images are sorted into some (static) arrays of names in mess.c. This is to allow easier/faster access to them and maybe useful for swapping the names and calling init_<device> again. The third stage now walks through the list of devices of the driver which is to be started and calls it's init functions with the the names from the arrays. If the driver returns non zero, the startup process is terminated here.
