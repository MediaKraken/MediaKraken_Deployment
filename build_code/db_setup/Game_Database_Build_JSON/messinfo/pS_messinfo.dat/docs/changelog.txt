0.175:
======

- fmtowns.cpp: Added more info, based on Breiztiger's research in fmtowns_cd.xml. Added a new software list for floppy-only FM Towns games (boot disks for CDs remain in the CD list, for easier launching). Many thanks to r09 and Breiztiger for help with info and images in fmtowns_flop.xml [Fabio Priuli]. Completed addition of known dumps in fmtowns_cd.xml [r09, Breiztiger].
- gb.cpp: Added Rumble emulation to the MBC-5 Game Boy Color games which supported it. MAME will now output a "Rumble" output bit (0 for Rumble=OFF and 1 for Rumble=ON) whenever the games try to access the Rumble component… third party applications can now listen to the output and redirect it to some hardware that can "rumble" in sync with the gameplay. Added partial RTC emulation to the MBC-3 Game Boy Color games which supported it. Clock proceeds a bit too fast during gameplay, but at least it is not stuck anymore to the time of first configuration [Fabio Priuli].
- gba.cpp: Documented some more Game Boy Advance PCBs in gba.xml. Several improvements: * Implemented emulation of the "General Purpose I/O" port (GPIO) of GBA * Hooked up S-3511 RTC emulation through the GPIO port. This allows to avoid the "Internal battery has run dry [...] clock-based events will no longer occur" messages in Pokémon Emerald / Ruby / Sapphire. This also promotes Sennen Kazoku to working state * Hooked up Boktai Light Sensor emulation through the GPIO port. This allows to avoid the "Solar Sensor is broken" message in Boktai / Bokura no Taiyou, which is now playable and to recharge your weapons in all three games of the series. Light level has to be chosen via the "Machine Configuration" menu, until we get some kind of camera input * Hooked up Warioware Twist Gyroscope emulation through the GPIO port. This allows to play the minigames, even if in some case the input sensibility might need a few tweaks * Hooked up Warioware Twist & Drill Dozer Rumble emulation through the GPIO port. MAME will now output a "Rumble" output bit (0 for Rumble=OFF and 1 for Rumble=ON)  whenever the games try to access the Rumble component… third party applications can now listen to the output and redirect it to some hardware that can "rumble" in sync with the gameplay. Implemented emulation of the Tilt sensor used by Yoshi’s Universal Gravitation / Yoshi Topsy-Turvy / Yoshi no Banyuuinryoku (and by Koro Koro Puzzle). Note that the calibration can seem a bit tricky at first, because the emulated screen does not turn as the GBA would. In order to properly calibrate the sensor, just keep pressed right for a few seconds when requested to calibrate right inclination (first calibration screen in Yoshi Universal Gravitation) so to get the full right range; then keep pressed for left for a few seconds when requested to calibrate left inclination (second calibration screen in Yoshi Universal Gravitation) so to get the full left range [Fabio Priuli].

- sms.cpp: Implemented some new findings: * Remove some mirrors for ports $DC/$DD on SMSJ based on Charles' hw tests * Add basic C-Sync callback to 315_5124.cpp, based on Charles' hw tests * Add built-in Rapid Fire (uses C-Sync) for SMSJ and Korean SMS1 drivers * Add new SMS drivers due to XTAL differences: sms1br - Tec Toy Master System I (Brazil) sms2br - Tec Toy Master System II (Brazil) smsbr - Tec Toy Master System III Compact (Brazil) sms1paln - Tec Toy Master System I (PAL-N) sms2paln - Tec Toy Master System II (PAL-N) smspaln - Tec Toy Master System III Compact (PAL-N) Brazil is PAL-M TV system, but I decided to call it by the country name, seems to be better recognizable and for emulation looks more like a NTSC system. PAL-N is used in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay and looks closer to the European PAL system when compared to PAL-M [Enik Land].
- sun2.cpp: Preliminary MMU implementation, still has issues. MMU fixes, both VME and Multibus variants now POST and show something. Fixed more MMU issues, added serial ports [R. Belmont].
- sun3.cpp: sun3 updates: * Split sun3 and sun3x archiectures, they're different enough * Sun3 MMU and unique hardware implemented, all models now POST including 3/2xx [R. Belmont].
- sun4.cpp: Preliminary implementation of sun4c MMU and related hardware [R. Belmont]. Add SPARC ASI descriptions [Vas Crabb]. Add older version SPARCstation IPX (Sun 4/50) ROM as an alt bios, and add ROM locations [Lord Nightmare].

- exl100: Added 'Exelvision EXL 100' cart list [Fabio Priuli].
- famicom: Converted the disk system add-on to be a cart in the softlist. The official syntax to launch disk games is now mess famicom -cart disksys -flop gamename which corresponds to inserting the RAM expansion cart with connected the disk drive into the cartslot and the desired disk in the disk drive (exactly like you would have done with the real thing). In this way, you cannot mount anymore both a cart and a disk in the Family Computer (as in a real unit). Users that cannot cope with this limitation and/or with the new syntax can still use the famitwin driver (which offers both cart and disk options) or the newly added driver fds which emulates a famicom with the expansion always inserted: in both latter cases the old syntax mess famitwin -flop gamename will launch the game, as previously. Fixed disk system IRQ latch clear in Kaettekita Mario Bros. based on investigations by FHorse [Fabio Priuli].
- gameboy: Added dump of Color GameBoy 188 in 1 multicart and partially implemented the required mapper [Team Europe, Fabio Priuli].

47814: Converted the driver to use slot devices for cartridges and implemented the IntelliVoice expansion and the Entertainment Computer System expansion as passthru devices. The official syntax to launch games requiring the speech expansion is now mess intv -cart voice -cart2 gamename which corresponds to mounting the IntelliVoice and plugging the game cart in its subslot. The official syntax to launch games requiring the ECS expansion is now instead mess intv -cart ecs -cart2 gamename and mess intv -cart ecs -cart2 voice -cart3 gamename if the game requires both expansions at once. For additional user friendliness, we also offer intvecs (which emulates an Intellivision unit with both expansions added) and intvoice (which emulates an Intellivision with Intellivoice expansion added) drivers, where games can simply be mounted with the -cart media switch [Fabio Priuli].

CIA changes: * Add missing virtual keyword to actually call the right TOD clock * Outputs depend on the input state (fixes A1000 overlay switch) * Switching to serial output mode with one-shot activated causes a pulse on SP (correct? needed for keyboard handshake) * Serial input is clocked by the CNT input, not the default clock * Mask offsets to 4 bits * Writing the Timer High register with one-shot activated immediately causes the timer to be latched and the timer started, regardless of timer start value [Dirk Best].
- amstrad.c: Added preliminary Amstrad/Pace RS232C interface. The terminal software included with the original Amstrad interface works, but not much else does at this stage. Added the ability for expansion devices to contain ROMs (as some do). Added ROMs for DK'Tronics Speech Synthesiser, and both RS232 interfaces (plus one alternate for the Amstrad interface).

- c64.c: Added another version of Super Snapshot 5 in c64_cart.xml [Malice]. Fixed Quickload (c64) to allow files packed with Kompressmaster v4.1-3 from Peter Arndt [M.A.S.H.]. C64 improvement & fix: * Cache pointers to basic and kernal ROMs at startup (they can be in separate ROM regions or a single ROM depending on model) rather than branching on every read * Moved "ProLogic-DOS Classic" BIOS from c64 to c64c, since it's clearly meant for, and only  successfully boots on, the latter machine. Some optimizations: * read_pla() leaves the PLA outputs packed, instead of using eight output parameters to return them * Flatten nested switch statements in read_memory() and write_memory() * mos6566: inline bus_r() and various READ_LINE_MEMBERs [Alex Jackson]. Precalculate PLA outputs for approximately 5% speedup [Curt Coder].

Added emulation of the barcode reader for Datach Joint ROM System unit, making playable most games using it. Properly implemented the Bandai Datach as a passthru cart. Datach games have now to be loaded with the following commands "mess nes -cart datach -cart2 gamename" where gamename can be either a shortname from the datach softlist, or a fullpath to the iNES files (or to headerless 256k dump of the Datach minicarts). This is accurate to the hardware, because Datach carts could not be mounted in the main Famicom cartridge slot. Fixed support for BMC-12in1 PCB, based on Cah4e3's research. Added support for NROM368 homebrew PCB. Added support for Multi-Discrete PCB (aka Mapper 28) used by Action 53 - Function 16 - Volume ONE - 'Streemerz Bundle' homebrew multicart.

Accurately emulated the behavior when mounting both a cart and a card in the system, cleaned up RAM accesses, simplified code handling cart/card/exp enable. Fixed behavior of the TH pin in the Japanese SMS consoles. Fixed light phaser support through the gender adapter and adopted RAM init pattern on Export consoles too (Korean systems are acknowledged as Export and some Korean games rely on this). Fixed Korean Gam*Boy 2 being detected as a Japanese machine when a real unit does not [Enik Land].

Stored data for 26.7 & 27.7 phase shifts with corrections and label for 25.7 values. Made 26.7 (medium) default. Phase shifting falls outside the realm of video controls and hope to implement a selectable toggle hardware option similar to Donkey Kong TKG02/TKG04 [Robert Tuccitto].
- at.c: Preliminary PS/1 support [Carl].
- cat.c: Switched driver to use the new DUART n68681 core. Fix a silly issue with the video ram mapping on the IAI Swyft; now it does visible I/O accesses; the peripherals need to be figured out and hooked up still. More swyft WIP, still doesn't do very much. Found out it uses an ACIA (by looking at the rom code, 'init6850' function is kind of a giveaway), plus found where the control register for it lives [Lord Nightmare].

- sms.c: Enhancements for Sega Scope and LCD persistence and fix SMS Light Phaser TH read bug. Reduce tagmap lookups for sscope and fixed validation error when using the lphaser controller on a driver with sscope support. Added expansion slot and implemented the gender adapter to allow regular cartridges to be played through the expansion slot. Usage example: mess sms1 -exp genderadp -cart2 wcup90 * Made the cartridge slot on the sg1000m3 driver to no longer be mandatory allowing the driver to also be started with media in the cardslot. Enabled crosshair display on all screens. This makes missil3d playable on the plain '2D' view with scope emulation enabled. Improved I/O handling for Japanese and Korean drivers (Pause button for sg1000m3, TH input for sg1000m3 and smsj, and output via controller ports for Japanese and Korean drivers) [Enik Land].

========
- bridgec3: Updated description to 'Fidelity Electronics Bridge Challenger 3 (model 7014)'. Added pcb locations, notes, and better labels [Lord Nightmare].
- acrnsys1: Added cassette [Robbbert].
- alphatro: Added floppy software list [Spirantho].
- bml3: Added software list for floppy disks [Anna Wu]. Split into three variants (bml3, bml3a and bml3b) according to floppy disk support. Only bml3a (5.25" disk) is considered WORKING. Add stub variants bml3mk2 (for MB-6891) and bml3mk5 (for MB-6892). For now these behave the same as bml3 (MB-6890). Refactor disk controllers and kanji ROM as slot devices. This allows switching between MP-1802 and MP-1805 disk controllers. MP-1805 disk controller now works. Kanji ROM now works. Keyboard scanning in 'counter disabled' mode now works [jedwidz].

Belmont]. SNES SA-1 work: * Initial support for plain SA-1 DMA * Fixed incorrect BWRAM banking * Fixed SA-1 vectors to not blot out all banks * Added S-CPU vector override * Fire interrupt for CC type 1; this allows levelling up in SMRPG (gfx not correct yet) [Fabio Priuli, R. Belmont].

Improvements and fixes to inputs: * Simplified input reading * Moved most Famicom controllers to the expansion port (still configurable in the Driver Config menu) because it is more accurate and because it allows to use both the FC keyboard and the controllers in BASIC games * Fixed NES paddle emulation which broke some years ago * Added FC paddle emulation, see Arkanoid and Chase HQ * Added Hori Twin Adapter with correct P3 & P4 Famicom protocol, see  e.g. four players games by Technos Japan just a cleanup and the whatsnew entry for previous changes. Emulated microphone input for old famicom controller, as detected by games (i.e. it only detects voice/no voice, while the actual transmission of your voice to the speakers is not emulated). To use it in games expecting you to blow or shout in the mic, select the
- pc.c: PC driver cleanup: * Much improved CS4031 emulation, added DMA, interrupt controller, timer, RTC directly to the device as sub devices and added the generic functions needed for AT compatibility * Moved the ct486 driver to its own file, to avoid all the legacy stuff in at.c * Added support for the IOCHCK signal to the ISA bus, this is used instead of directly issuing an NMI to the main CPU * Moved ISA device slot definitions to its own file to avoid copy & pasting the same list to different drivers * Updated MC146818 RTC for devcb2 [Dirk Best].

Baseball lock-on mechanism, based on the tests performed by naruko on his carts: when you load nantbb, a second cartslot becomes available to load one of the two update minicarts (91 Hen or OB Hen) * Improved emulation of Namcot 163, 175 and 340 boards, based on the tests performed by naruko, lidnariq and bootgod on the real hardware * Moved Nantettatte!! Baseball minicarts to a separate list (nes_ntbrom.xml) because they cannot be loaded in the NES directly, but only through the nantbb subslot * Emulated bus conflict (CPU/PRG) in PCBs documented as having it * Partial emulation of open bus, enough to make working the games using it as a sort of protection * Fixed crash when loading files using FFE mappers * Fixed mirroring in some boards (Sunsoft DCS and UNL-CC-21) and in some games (e.g. Paris Dakar Rally Special and Escape from Atlantis) * Fixed a few bugs in  Tengen 800032 emulation (mapper 64), promoting Klax, Xybots and Road Runner to working state * Fixed Tengen 800037 emulation (mapper 158), promoting US Alien Syndrome to working state * Fixed NINA-001 emulation (mapper 34), promoting Impossible Mission II to working state * Improved Taito LROG017 emulation (mapper 77), promoting Napoleon Senki to working state * Added emulation of the Sachen SA-9602B pcb used by Mei Shao Nv Meng Gong Chang, a chinese port of Princess Maker by Sachen, based on the great work done by Cah4e3 in FCEUMM * Added working emulation of many bootleg pcbs used for pirate conversions from FDS (Ai Senshi Nicol, Doki Doki Panic, Fuuun Shaolin Kyo, Green Beret, Monty no Doki Doki Daidassou, Tobidase Daisakusen, Super Mario Bros Malee 2 / Genius Merio Bros.) * Improved emulation of many pirate pcb (BMC-GOLDENCARD-6IN1, KS7013B, KS7012, BMC-GHOSTBUSTERS63IN1, UNL-MALISB, MAXI15 and more) * Improved RacerMate Challenge II emulation, but the game is still not working due to unemulated bicycle controller * Added CPU-based IRQ mode in Tengen 800032 emulation (mapper 64), fixing Skulls & Crossbones gfx (but the game is still not working) * Improved IRQ handling fixing a lot of 1-line glitches, fixing gfx corruption in the upper half of Pinbot tables and allowing Sangokushi II - Haou no Tairiku to boot. * Fixed many small inaccuracies in the old code, spot during the conversion * Added support for most other known pcbs, even if in most cases emulation is only sketchy * Reduced the need of fake alt pbcs for boards which only differed by mirroring handling (these are now recognized through the "mirroring" feature) * Removed fake wram which was added to a lot of partially documented pcbs and re-added it only where actually present, so to more accurately document what was really in the carts [Fabio Priuli].

- cat.c: Got rid of the keyboard interrupt timer and hooked the keyboard interrupt to the 6ms timer instead, which is closer to hardware. The cursor blinks at a more correct but not completely correct rate now. The duart (the REAL source of the interrupts, which should fire with the transitions of the 12ms period squarewave) still does not work for interrupts properly, it needs its innards fixed. Fixed the v2.40 bioses thinking the phone is constantly ringing; Documented what all the DUART IO pins are connected to, and correctly hooked DUART IP2 up to invert when the 6ms timer expires, removing the previous hack (and fixing the ringing bug). Fixed a mistake in the memory map mirroring due to an error during testing; added proper readback of the floppy control register, and corrected the floppy status readback so it thinks that no floppy is inserted [Lord Nightmare].
- dectalk.c: Renamed dectalk roms to match the DEC 23-xxxLn standard and noted what their actual paper labels were (these paper labels will differ on different dectalk units depending on exactly when they were made, though the ROM contents are exactly the same! The derivable 23-xxxLn part number will not change, though.). Added more comments [Lord Nightmare].
- gb.c: Bugfix #005152: [Interface] (gb.c) all gameboy.c sets: Crashes on exit when no cart was successfully loaded [Firewave]. Attempt in emulating protection for Chong Wu Xiao Jing Ling/Pokemon Pikecho [Fabio Priuli].

- sms.c: Fixed master clock speed for PAL machines. Improved hcount handling resulting in better results from Flubba's VDP timing checks [Enik Land].
- snes.c: Updated the driver to only save the real amount of SRAM present on the cart. This means that old .nv files won't be directly compatible with newer exe, but you shall be able to keep your saves by backing them up and taking the first block of the correct size (e.g. if you take the first 8KB block of your old .nv for Super Metroid it should work fine with the new exe). At the same time, MESS should be now compatible with saves taken in other  emulators. Several updates to cart handling: * Moved Sufami Turbo and BSX carts to separate lists * Added emulation for DSP1/4, ST-010/011, S-DD1, SPC7110, SuperFX, BS-X and Sufami Turbo as slot devices * Added emulation for the protection device used in some pirate carts. Major overhaul of cart and add-on handling: * Updated carts to be slot devices * Simplified loading and bankswitch mechanism * Removed drivers snessfx and snespsfx: SuperFX/GSU games can now be loaded in snes and snespal * Removed drivers snesdsp and snespdsp: NEC DSPx

- vip: Fixed VP-700 Tiny BASIC ROM mapping and VP-620 ASCII keyboard [Curt Coder].
- vk100: Correctly hooked up vsync interrupt to crtc instead of video subsystem; Figured out the low two bits of SYSTAT_A from tracing and hooked both up, and updated the SYSTAT_A documentation comments. Additional documentation comments for the SMC COM5016T baud rate divider. Made the DU/DVM/DIR/WOPS 8*4bit register file an actual 4-entry array, to simplify address decoding later. IO mirroring, also a lot of prom tracing and comment updates. Simplification of the code by emulating the register file as an array [Lord Nightmare].

- vk100: Documented all the inputs and enables of the RAS/ERASE prom through tracing. Documented that the MSB bit of the SYNC prom is SYNC. The VT125 Schematics were invaluable for this [Lord Nightmare, Al Kossow] Doing further vector rom tracing with a meter on the board using the vt125 schematics as a guide, figured out what all the vectorrom pins do (except perhaps D LOAD). Implemented baud generator LUT for i8251, not hooked up yet; added RTS callback which doesn't seem to work yet. Further comment updates, got rid of LASTVRAM in favor of doing a single read at the current nybble pointed to by the X and Y registers. Broke the vram access logic/math out of the vector generator callback and into its own functions; fixed? the systat_a register to read the vram nybble the x and y regs are currently pointing to. Some improvement to the HLE vector generator, now properly emulates the down counter so the "blue screen" part of the POST looks correct, as does the cursor width [Lord Nightm

- c64.c: Added support for per-byte speed zones in G64 images. Emulated the digital read circuitry of the Commodore 1541 disk drive according to the long board schematics. This will allow independent setting of the bitrate of incoming data and the sample rate. Passing more advanced copy protections require a cycle exact rewrite of the 6502 and VIA, but this is the first step toward proper emulation. Fixed C1541 and FSD-2, added Dolphin DOS 2.0 and Professional-DOS V1 hardware [Curt Coder].
- llc.c: Modernised; LLC2 added support for reverse video & added missing pio [Robbbert].

- vk100: Implemented or stubbed the rest of the io registers, left SYSTAT_A commented for now since its behavior is unclear. Added and attached the dipswitches to SYSTAT_B (though this may well be wrong). Hooked up the i8251 uart preliminarily (ints not hooked up yet). Implemented stubs for the rest of the VG registers. Figured out pattern rom addressing. Miscellaneous progress, slight cleanup to keyboard, stubbed and implemented a bunch of vector generator addresses. Correct the labels of several proms which were unreadable on the vk100 that they were dumped from [nigwil]. Hook up vblank interrupt (critical selftest now passes); add layout for LEDS, beginning of skeleton keyboard support. Attach keyboard. Update comments to reflect that the pr1 prom is clearly the VECTOR ROM. Add notes about what each address bit does or is thought to do (the tech manual documentation is lousy, but is better than nothing). Vector generator uses "real" timing instead of drawing the vector instantly.
- vt100: Fix vt100 to use beep instead of speaker. Some work still needs to be done to beep.c since the phase needs to be reset in such a way that keyclicks work consistently, in addition to beeps. Added missing dot stretching to the DEC VT100's dc012 emulation. See EK-VT100-TM-003 page 4-76 for a description. Note the stretching takes place after the character rom but before invert or other attributes [Lord Nightmare].

Belmont]: * All Apple IIs that had slots now have them in MESS except the IIgs. * Slot 0 has one available card: the language card (which it defaults to) Slots 1-7 can have any of the Mockingboard, CFFA2000, and Disk II cards. * By default a Mockingboard is in Slot 4 and the Disk II is in 6. Due to current limitations only one Disk II controller per machine will work, but multiple CFFAs and Mockingboards should work great. The plain 6502 firmware version of the CFFA2000 is now supported so you can use CHDs with the emulated II Plus and unenhanced IIe as well. 5.25" disks are broken on the IIgs at the moment; I'm looking into it. Updates: * Improved C800 arbitration. * Cleanup and more documentation. * New working card: Apple II "Slinky" 1 MB Memory Expansion Card. * New non-working card: Apple II SCSI Card, Rev. C. And: Support AE RamFactor card (clone of Apple Memory Expansion). Fixed C800 banking with INTCXROM and implemented RamFactor card ROM banking. RamFactor diagnostic (g Cn0a in the Monitor) now works. RamFactor cards now have 8 MB capacity each. Even more slot ROM arbitration work. 80 column mode works on IIe again, and AppleWorks 3 no longer crashes on boot.

0.36rc1:
========
- Amiga driver fixes! Notes: You will have to redefine some of the button(s) to your mouse buttons when using the mouse (You cant bind them directly from the driver).  You can select to have either mouse or joystick attached to the ports through the dipswitches. The Amiga detects external drives by querying them. Right now, only drives are added to the the system which have an image in them. There is still no keyboard emulation. This version supports many more gfx modes, sprites, input modes, etc and compatibility with many software has increased. Rewrote large portions of the floppy controller. More games should load properly now. Moved things around using banks, wHich decreased the overall memory requeriments for the driver from 16 megs to 2 megs. Removed the extra 'chip' and 'extended' ram from the default configuration. The current memory setup should be the same as a stock A500 [Ernesto Corvi].
- a5200 keypad problems (finally) solved. only player #1 keypad supported. Analog joystick still sort of sluggish, but useable in many games. Be sure to check the new key mappings using the on screen display (TAB key) [Juergen Buchmueller].
- a7800 palette modified [Juergen Buchmueller, Julian Eggebrecht].
- Huge update to the a800 family drivers. Be sure to check the new key mappings using the on screen display (TAB key) [Juergen Buchmueller].

- coco: Added support for true lower case in lores text modes, and special characters in hires text modes for the CoCo 3 and added a "blur correction" mode for artifact colors in an attempt to make artifact colors be displayed more accurately.  Fixed a few CoCo III related bugs; most notably with PAK loading.  The CoCo driver will now recognize .PAK files that contain snapshot information (meaning that most .PAK files on the net will now work).  In addition, .PAK files are now loaded as IO_SNAPSHOT, rather than IO_CARTSLOT. Implemented the previously unimplemented graphics modes (G1C/G1R/G2C/G2R), enabled the fancy semigraphic modes; on the CoCo one could change the VDG as one mode but tell the SAM (synchronous address multiplexer) to feed data to the VDG as if a different video mode was done. This created the semigraphic modes that were used in games like Protector. Plot_pixel() is now used instead of assuming 8-bit bitmaps [Nate Woods].
- ColecoVision Video refresh fixed [Sean Young].
- Nate Woods, Ernesto Corvi added MacIntosh Plus driver.
- Nate Woods added Tandy MC-10 driver.
- Sean Young added MSX driver (Japanese and Korean).

New features include Fixed bankswitching/RAM problem, YM2413 support and enable switch, console territory switch, remaining input ports mapped (Player 2, etc.), and split up I/O port map for SMS and GG. Compatability has been improved significantly, however, games that use on-cart RAM will not work properly [Charles MacDonald].
- Spectrum changes include disk Image support for +3, loading/saving from WAV, Spectrum+/Spectrum 128 keyboard mappings, Improved I/O decoding (Kempston active on all ports xx1f), support for .TAP tape files (use the normal LOAD"" when emulation starts. In Normal Speccy mode press "J" then SHIFT+P ), and Full key descriptions, and 128k .z80 images not loaded.  Also includes "Issue 2" and "Issue 3" emulation [David Robertson, Kev Thacker].
- Paul Daniels added Compukit UK101 driver.

- Updates to cgenie, trs80 and ti99_4a due to wd179x update [Juergen Buchmueller].
- coco: PMODE 4 artifact colors in the CoCo drivers. The COCO had a black and white video mode that actually had two more colors in there that were created because the TV couldn't actually handle the high resolution. These colors would not appear on some monitors, and when they did appear, they would sometimes switch back and forth. Added a "dip switch" to the driver to control how these artifact colors are displayed, if at all [Nate Woods].
- CoCo 3 CMP/RGB color sets - the CoCo 3 had different color sets depending on whether a composite monitor/tv was used, or whether an RGB monitor was used. Now the CoCo 3 driver can emulate either display, and this is controlled from another dip switch [Nate Woods].
- Added CRC's for the cpc464, cpc664, kc85_4 and Spectrum+3 roms [Kev Thacker].
- ep128: wd179x disk access update. The correct sector size is now calculated for the nec765 real FDD access. Now it is calculated from sector size. Loading from real disc works on Enterprise emulator [Kev Thacker].

The image is loaded as soon as the BASIC prompt is show (">" in line 4) and floppy controller is disabled in trs80_init() when no floppy disk image is specified [Juergen Buchmueller].
- Minor improvements to the graphics display in the amstrad driver. A border is shown and the screen is centralised in the horizontal. Vertical centering not done properly done yet. Graphics routines use plot_pixel so work in 8-bit and 16-bit colour [Kev Thacker]. amstrad disk image support!  Thanks to nec765 floppy disc controller emulation. This provides loading of disk images in the CPCEMU standard and extended disk image formats (the most common format available on the net) [Kev Thacker].
- Changed the cgenie driver to use the opbaseoverride() to load a .cas file from the command line. This works for unprotected, binary *.cas files only, though.  From inside the emulation you can still load binary images with the SYSTEM command and BASIC files with CLOAD"<letter> [Juergen Buchmueller]. Fixed some minor cgenie problems, like loading *.cas files from inside the emulation with names shorter than 6 characters [Juergen Buchmueller].
