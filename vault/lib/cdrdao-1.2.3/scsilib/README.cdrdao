This is a snapshot of Joerg Schilling's SCSI library from cdrtools-2.01a31.

The additional directory 'export' is used to hold some links to include
files and built libraries for easy access by the remaining cdrdao package.

It is also possible to use an installed SCSI library. See "INSTALL" in the
main directory for more information.
