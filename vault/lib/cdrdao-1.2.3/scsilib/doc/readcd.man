       rreeaaddccdd ddeevv==_d_e_v_i_c_e [ _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ]


DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       RReeaaddccdd is used to read or write Compact Discs.

       The _d_e_v_i_c_e refers to _s_c_s_i_b_u_s/_t_a_r_g_e_t/_l_u_n of the drive. Com-
       munication on _S_u_n_O_S is done with the SCSI  general  driver
       ssccgg..   Other operating systems are using a library simula-
       tion of this  driver.   Possible  syntax  is:  ddeevv==  _s_c_s_i_-
       _b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n  or  ddeevv==  _t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.  In the latter case,
       the drive has to be connected to the default SCSI  bus  of
       the machine.  _S_c_s_i_b_u_s, _t_a_r_g_e_t and _l_u_n are integer numbers.
       Some operating systems or SCSI  transport  implementations
       may  require  to  specify a filename in addition.  In this
       case the correct syntax for the device  is:  ddeevv==  _d_e_v_i_c_e_-
       _n_a_m_e:_s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n or ddeevv== _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.  If
       the name of the device node that  has  been  specified  on
       such  a system refers to exactly one SCSI device, a short-
       hand  in  the  form  ddeevv==  _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_@  or  ddeevv==  _d_e_v_i_c_e_-
       _n_a_m_e:_@,_l_u_n  may  be  used instead of ddeevv== _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_s_c_s_i_-
       _b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.


       To access remote SCSI devices, you  need  to  prepend  the
       SCSI  device name by a remote device indicator. The remote
       device  indicator  is   either   RREEMMOOTTEE::_u_s_e_r_@_h_o_s_t_:   or
       RREEMMOOTTEE::_h_o_s_t_:
       A  valid remote SCSI device name may be: RREEMMOOTTEE::_u_s_e_r_@_h_o_s_t_:
       to    allow    remote     SCSI     bus     scanning     or
       RREEMMOOTTEE::_u_s_e_r_@_h_o_s_t_:_1_,_0_,_0  to  access the SCSI device at _h_o_s_t
       connected to SCSI bus # 1,target 0 lun 0.


       To access SCSI devices via alternate transport layers, you
       need  to prepend the SCSI device name by a transport layer
       indicator.  The transport layer indicator may be something
       like  UUSSCCSSII:: or AATTAAPPII::.  To get a list of supported trans-
       port layers for your platform, use ddeevv== _H_E_L_P:


       To make rreeaaddccdd portable to all UNIX platforms, the  syntax
       ddeevv==  _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n  is  preferred  as  is
       hides OS specific knowledge about device  names  from  the
       user.  A specific OS must not necessarily support a way to
       specify a real device file name nor a way to specify _s_c_s_i_-
       _b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.


       _S_c_s_i_b_u_s  0  is  the default SCSI bus on the machine. Watch
       the boot  messages  for  more  information  or  look  into
       //vvaarr//aaddmm//mmeessssaaggeess for more information about the SCSI con-
       figuration of your machine.  If you have problems to  fig-
       ure out what values for _s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n should be used,
       try the --ssccaannbbuuss option of ccddrreeccoorrdd.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       If no options except the _d_e_v_= option have been  specified,
       rreeaaddccdd goes into interactive mode.  Select a primary func-
       tion and then follow the instructions.


       --vveerrssiioonn
              Print version information and exit.

       ddeevv==_t_a_r_g_e_t
              Sets the SCSI  target  for  the  drive,  see  notes
              above.  A typical device specification is ddeevv==_6_,_0 .
              If a filename must be provided  together  with  the
              numerical  target  specification,  the  filename is
              implementation specific.  The correct  filename  in
              this case can be found in the system specific manu-
              als of the target operating system.  On  a  _F_r_e_e_B_S_D
              system  without  _C_A_M  support,  you need to use the
              control device (e.g.   _/_d_e_v_/_r_c_d_0_._c_t_l).   A  correct
              device   specification   in   this   case   may  be
              ddeevv==_/_d_e_v_/_r_c_d_0_._c_t_l_:_@ .

              On Linux,  drives  connected  to  a  parallel  port
              adapter are mapped to a virtual SCSI bus. Different
              adapters are mapped to different  targets  on  this
              virtual SCSI bus.

              If  no  _d_e_v option is present, ccddrreeccoorrdd will try to
              get the device from the CCDDRR__DDEEVVIICCEE environment.

              If the argument to the ddeevv== option does not contain
              the  characters  ',', '/', '@' or ':', it is inter-
              preted as an label name that may be  found  in  the
              file /etc/default/cdrecord (see FILES section).

       ttiimmeeoouutt==_#
              Set  the  default  SCSI  command timeout value to _#
              seconds.  The default SCSI command timeout  is  the
              minimum timeout used for sending SCSI commands.  If
              a SCSI command fails due to a timeout, you may  try
              to raise the default SCSI command timeout above the
              timeout value of the failed command.  If  the  com-
              mand  runs correctly with a raised command timeout,
              please report the better timeout value and the cor-
              responding  command  to  the author of the program.
              If no _t_i_m_e_o_u_t option is present, a default  timeout
              of 40 seconds is used.

       ddeebbuugg==_#_, --dd
              Set  the  misc  debug  value to # (with debug=#) or
              increment the misc debug level by one (with -d). If
              you  specify _-_d_d_, this equals to ddeebbuugg==_2_.  This may
              help to find problems while opening  a  driver  for
              libscg.   as  well  as with sector sizes and sector
              types.  Using --ddeebbuugg slows down the process and may
              be the reason for a buffer underrun.

       kkddeebbuugg==#, kkdd==#
              Tell  the  ssccgg-driver  to  modify  the kernel debug
              value while SCSI commands are running.

       --ssiilleenntt, --ss
              Do not print out a status report  for  failed  SCSI
              commands.

       --vv     Increment  the  level  of general verbosity by one.
              This is used e.g. to display the  progress  of  the
              process.

       --VV     Increment  the  verbose  level with respect of SCSI
              command transport by  one.   This  helps  to  debug
              problems  during the process, that occur in the CD-
              Recorder.  If you get incomprehensible  error  mes-
              sages you should use this flag to get more detailed
              output.  --VVVV will show data buffer content in addi-
              tion.  Using --VV or --VVVV slows down the process.

       ff==_f_i_l_e Specify  the  filename  where  the output should be
              written or the inout should be  taken  from.  Using
              '-'  as  filename  will  cause rreeaaddccdd to use ssttddoouutt
              resp. ssttddiinn.

       --ww     Switch to write mode. If this option  is  not  pre-
              sent, rreeaaddccdd reads from the specified device.

       --cc22ssccaann
              Scans  the  whole  CD or the range specified by the
              sseeccttoorrss==_r_a_n_g_e for C2 errors. C2 errors  are  errors
              that  are  uncorrectable  after the second stage of
              the 24/28 + 28/32 Reed Solomon correction system at
              audio  level  (2352 bytes sector size). If an audio
              CD has C2 errors, interpolation is needed  to  hide
              the  errors.  If  a  data  CD  has C2 errors, these
              errors are in most cases corrected by  the  ECC/EDC
              code  that makes 2352 bytes out of 2048 data bytes.
              The ECC/EDC code should be able  to  correct  about
              100 C2 error bytes per sector.

              If  you  find  C2 errors you may want to reduce the
              speed using the ssppeeeedd== option as C2 errors may be a
              result of dynamic unbalance on the medium.

       sseeccttoorrss==_r_a_n_g_e
              Specify  a  sector  range that should be read.  The
              range is specified by the starting sector number, a
              minus  sign  and the ending sector number.  The end
              sector is not included in the list, so  sseeccttoorrss==0-0
              will not read anything and may be used to check for
              a CD in the drive.

       ssppeeeedd==#
              Set the speed factor of the read or  write  process
              to  #.  # is an integer, representing a multiple of
              the audio speed.  This is about 150 KB/s for CD-ROM
              and  about  172  KB/s  for  CD-Audio.   If no _s_p_e_e_d
              option is present, rreeaaddccdd will use  maximum  speed.
              Only  MMC  compliant  drives will benefit from this
              option.   The  speed  of  non  MMC  drives  is  not
              changed.

              Using a lower speed may increase the readability of
              a CD or DVD.

       --nnoottrruunncc
              Do not truncate the outputfile when opening it.

       --ffuullllttoocc
              Retrieve a full TOC from the current disk and print
              it in hex.

       --cclloonnee Do  a  clone read. Read the CD with all sub-channel
              data and a full TOC.  The full TOC data will be but
              into a file with similar name as with the ff== option
              but the suffix ..ttoocc added.

       --nnooeerrrroorr
              Do not abort if the high level  error  checking  in
              rreeaaddccdd  found  an  uncorrectable  error in the data
              stream.

       --nnooccoorrrr
              Switch the drive into a mode where it ignores  read
              errors  in data sectors that are a result of uncor-
              rectable ECC/EDC errors before reading.  If  rreeaaddccdd
              completes,  the error recovery mode of the drive is
              switched back to the remembered old mode.

       rreettrriieess==_#
              Set the retry  count  for  high  level  retries  in
              rreeaaddccdd  to  _#.   The  default  is to do 128 retries
              which may be too much if you like to read a CD with
              many unreadable sectors.

       --oovveerrhheeaadd
              Meter the SCSI command overhead time.  This is done
              by executing several commands 1000 times and print-
              ing  the  total  time  used. If you divide the dis-
              played times by 1000, you get the average  overhead
              time for a single command.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       For  all examples below, it will be assumed that the drive
       is connected to the primary SCSI bus of the  machine.  The
       SCSI target id is set to 2.

       To  read the complete media from a CD-ROM writing the data
       to the file _c_d_i_m_a_g_e_._r_a_w:

           readcd dev=2,0 f=cdimage.raw

       To read sectors from range 150 ...  10000  from  a  CD-ROM
       writing the data to the file _c_d_i_m_a_g_e_._r_a_w:

           readcd dev=2,0 sectors=150-10000 f=cdimage.raw

       To  write  the  data  from  the  file  _c_d_i_m_a_g_e_._r_a_w (e.g. a
       filesystem image from mmkkiissooffss) to a DVD-RAM, call:

           readcd dev=2,0 -w f=cdimage.raw


EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       RRSSHH    If the RRSSHH environment is present, the remote  con-
              nection  will  not  be  created  via rrccmmdd(3) but by
              calling the program pointed to by  RRSSHH.   Use  e.g.
              RRSSHH==/usr/bin/ssh  to  create a secure shell connec-
              tion.

              Note that this forces ccddrreeccoorrdd to create a pipe  to
              the   rrsshh((11))  program  and  disallows  ccddrreeccoorrdd  to
              directly access the network socket  to  the  remote
              server.  This makes it impossible to set up perfor-
              mance parameters and slows down the connection com-
              pared to a rroooott initiated rrccmmdd((33)) connection.

       RRSSCCSSII  If  the  RRSSCCSSII  environment  is present, the remote

              by RRSSCCSSII.  Note that the remote SCSI server program
              name will be ignored if you log in using an account
              that has been created with  a  remote  SCSI  server
              program as login shell.

       If you don't want to allow users to become  root  on  your
       system,  rreeaaddccdd  may  safely  be installed suid root. This
       allows all users or a group of users with no  root  privi-
       leges  to use rreeaaddccdd..  RReeaaddccdd in this case will only allow
       access to CD-ROM type drives- To give all user  access  to
       use rreeaaddccdd,, enter:

            chown root /usr/local/bin/readcd
            chmod 4711 /usr/local/bin/readcd

       To  give  a  restricted  group  of  users access to rreeaaddccdd
       enter:

            chgrp cdburners /usr/local/bin/readcd
            chmod 4710 /usr/local/bin/readcd

       and add a group _c_d_b_u_r_n_e_r_s on your system.

       Never give write permissions for non  root  users  to  the
       _/_d_e_v_/_s_c_g_?   devices  unless  you  would  allow  anybody to
       read/write/format all your disks.

       You should not connect old drives that do not support dis-
       connect/reconnect to either the SCSI bus that is connected
       to the CD-Recorder or the source disk.

       tries to emulate the  functionality  of  the  scg  driver.
       Unfortunately,  the  sg driver on LLiinnuuxx has several severe
       bugs:

              at all.

       +o      It  cannot  get  the  SCSI status byte.  RReeaaddccdd for
              that reason cannot report failing SCSI commands  in
              some situations.

       +o      It  cannot  get real DMA count of transfer.  RReeaaddccdd
              cannot tell you if there is an DMA residual  count.

       +o      It  cannot  get number of bytes valid in auto sense
              data.  RReeaaddccdd cannot tell you if  device  transfers
              no sense data at all.

       +o      It  fetches  to  few  data  in  auto  request sense
              (CCS/SCSI-2/SCSI-3 needs >= 18).

       A typical error message for a SCSI command looks like:

              readcd: I/O error. test unit ready: scsi sendcmd: no error
              CDB:  00 20 00 00 00 00
              status: 0x2 (CHECK CONDITION)
              Sense Bytes: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 25 00 00 00 00 00
              Sense Key: 0x5 Illegal Request, Segment 0
              Sense Code: 0x25 Qual 0x00 (logical unit not supported) Fru 0x0
              Sense flags: Blk 0 (not valid)
              cmd finished after 0.002s timeout 40s

       The first line gives information about  the  transport  of
       the  command.   The  text  after the first colon gives the
       error text for the system call from the view of  the  ker-
       nel.  It  usually is: II//OO eerrrroorr unless other problems hap-
       pen. The next words contain a short  description  for  the
       SCSI command that fails. The rest of the line tells you if
       there were any problems for the transport of  the  command
       over the SCSI bus.  ffaattaall eerrrroorr means that it was not pos-
       sible to transport the command (i.e. no device present  at
       the requested SCSI address).

       The  second  line prints the SCSI command descriptor block
       for the failed command.

       The third line gives information on the SCSI  status  code
       returned  by  the command, if the transport of the command
       succeeds.  This is error information from the SCSI device.

       The  fourth  line  is a hex dump of the auto request sense
       information for the command.

       The fifth line is the error text  for  the  sense  key  if
       available,  followed  by  the  segment number that is only
       valid if the command was a _c_o_p_y command. If the error mes-
       sage  is  not directly related to the current command, the
       text _d_e_f_e_r_r_e_d _e_r_r_o_r is appended.

       The sixth line is the error text for the  sense  code  and
       the  sense  qualifier  if  available.   If the type of the
       device is known, the sense data is decoded from tables  in
       _s_c_s_i_e_r_r_s_._c  .  The text is followed by the error value for
       a field replaceable unit.

       The seventh line prints the block number that  is  related
       to  the  failed  command and text for several error flags.
       The block number may not be valid.

       The eight line reports the timeout set up for this command
       and the time that the command really needed to complete.
