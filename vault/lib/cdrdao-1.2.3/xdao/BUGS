-	-	Infinite messages from cdrdao if you close xcdrdao while
		extracting: xcdrdao should not exit!! and if xcdrdao crashes
		cdrdao should get a SIGPIPE, continue recording and send
		messages to stdout if appropiate, but don't try to send
		messages to xcdrdao again.

-	-	In the Extract process xcdrdao is getting: 31 32 33 32 33 34 !!
		of trackProgress this makes the progressbar decrease and
		increase. It looks ugly :)

-	-	Using a big number with buffers when recording won't work!
		'new' throwing an exception? (try ... else ... ???)

-	-	I can press the eject button on my cdrom and the CD will
		eject, the problem is that I'm extracting! xcdrdao/cdrdao
		should block the CD! until the operation is done.

-	-	When writing (simulated!) I was not able to eject the CD,
		good :), but if I try (in gmc) right click->eject device,
		this command will block, and make cdrdao "hang" without
		any error messages until you abort the recording, then
		the CD will eject ;). The device should not receive any
		other command when writing!!!
