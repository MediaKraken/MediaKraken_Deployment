Using binary wheels
-------------------

On windows 7+, compiled ffpyplayer binaries can be installed for python 2.7 and 3.4,
on either a 32 or 64 bit system using::

    pip install ffpyplayer

.. warning::

    Although the ffpyplayer source code is licensed under the LGPL, the ffpyplayer wheels
    for Windows on PYPI are distributed under the GPL because the pre-compiled FFmpeg binaries
    are GPL'd. For LGPL builds you can compile FFmpeg yourself using LGPL options.

For other OSs or to compile with master see below.

Compiling
---------

Requirements
============

To compile ffpyplayer we need:

    * Cython (``pip install --upgrade cython``).
    * A c compiler e.g. MinGW  (``pip install mingwpy`` on windows).
    * SDL2 or SDL1.2 (SDL1.2 is not recommended). See :ref:`compille` for how to get it.
    * SDL2_mixer If wanting to play multiple audio files simultaneously (``USE_SDL2_MIXER`` must be set). See :ref:`compille` for how to get it.
    * A recent (2.x+, has been tested with 2.8) FFmpeg compiled with ``--enable-shared``.
      See :ref:`compille` for how to get it.

Compiling ffpyplayer
====================

On linux or mac, if the SDL2/SDL2_mixer or FFmpeg package config (.pc) files are on the path exported
in ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` the library and header files will automatically be found.

Otherwise, or if compiling on Windows, the following environmental variables are required.

    * ``SDL_LIB_DIR`` and ``FFMPEG_LIB_DIR`` should point to a folder which contains the
      SDL and FFmpeg library files (*.a files), respectively.
    * ``FFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIR`` should point to a directory which contains the FFmpeg header files.
    * ``SDL_INCLUDE_DIR`` should point to a directory containg the SDL headers. For SDL2,
      this directory contains a SDL2 named directory with all the headers.

In addition, directories containing the SDL and FFmpeg shared libraries, *.dlls on Windows
and *.so on Linux/Mac, need to be added to the PATH.

You can also select the FFmpeg libraries to be used by defining values for CONFIG_XXX.
For example, CONFIG_AVFILTER=0 will disable inclusion of the FFmpeg avfilter libraries.
See setup.py for all the available flags.

To use SDL2_mixer, which is required when multiple audio files are to be played
simultaneously (or even when they are open at the same time) environment variable ``USE_SDL2_MIXER``
must be set to 1 when compiling. SDL2_mixer binaries and headers must also be available.

Finally, run::

    pip install ffpyplayer

Or to install master, do::

    pip install https://github.com/matham/ffpyplayer/archive/master.zip

If you have a local zip with the ffpyplayer source code you can also run ``make``
or ``python setup.py build_ext --inplace`` to compile.

You should now be able to import ffpyplayer with ``import ffpyplayer``.

SDL and Compiling FFmpeg
------------------------

To use ffpyplayer, the compiled FFmpeg and SDL shared libraries must be available. Following are
instructions for the various OSs.

Windows
=======

You can get pre-compiled FFmpeg libaries from http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/. You need
both the shared (which contains the .a files and headers) and the dev (which contains the dlls)
downloads.

You can download SDL2 from https://www.libsdl.org/release/. 2.0.4 is the most recent
`version <https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-devel-2.0.4-mingw.tar.gz>`_.

You can download SDL2_mixer from https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/. 2.0.1 is the most recent
`version <https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release/SDL2_mixer-devel-2.0.1-mingw.tar.gz>`_.

OSX
===

You can get both FFmpeg and SDL2 using brew. You can install them using::

    brew update
    brew install sdl2
    brew install sdl2_mixer
    brew install ffmpeg --with-freetype --with-libass --with-libvorbis --with-libvpx --with-libmp3lame --with-x264 --with-libtheora

This automatically installs the package config (*.pc) files.

Ubuntu
======

Follow the instructions at https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu to compile FFMpeg.
However, those instructions detail how to build the static version. But we need the shared
version. This means that ``--enable-shared`` and ``--extra-cflags="-fPIC"`` need to be added
when compiling FFmpeg **AND** its dependencies. And if present, ``--disable-shared`` or
``--enable-static`` must be removed.

Following that guide, ``export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/ffmpeg_build/lib`` also needs
to be executed initially for the compiled binaries to be found.

To get SDL2, do the following::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev python-dev

You can find a complete minimal example of compiling ffpyplayer on Ubuntu
`here <https://github.com/matham/ffpyplayer/blob/master/.travis.yml#L20>`_.
