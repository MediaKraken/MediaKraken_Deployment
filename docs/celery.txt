mkque - general que that server picks up to distribute work

In app.py in web_app is the make_celery instance which allows population of
the mkque from the flask application.

The worker is kicked off from main_server.py which starts up
subprogram_reactor_string.py which in turn starts up the default mkque
workers.

Perhaps have each docker slave create a new que when it connects
to celery. This que could be a simple uuid or hostname of docker
server?
