= Description of validation and testing process via CI =

The Jenkins docker image I use is jenkins/jenkins:lts
    Then I install pip requirements file

The ELK docker image I use is https://github.com/spujadas/elk-docker
    This is used to view logs as they are output via MK programs

Run the following tests from under the MediaKraken_CI
    python3 validate_code.py
        Bandit to find unsecured code - against MediaKraken_Deployment source
        Vulture to find dead code - against MediaKraken_Deployment source
        Taint to find unsecured code - against MediaKraken_Deployment source
