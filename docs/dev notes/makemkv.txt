makemkvcon [options] Command Parameters

General options:

--messages=file
Output all messages to file. Following special file names are recognized:
-stdout - stdout
-stderr - stderr
-null - disable output
Default is stdout

--progress=file
Output all progress messages to file. The same special file names as in --messages are recognized with additional value "-same" to output to the same file as messages. Naturally --progress should follow --messages in this case. Default is no output.

--debug[=file]
Enables debug messages and optionally changes the location of debug file. Default: program preferences.

--directio=true/false
Enables or disables direct disc access. Default: program preferences.

--noscan
Don't access any media during disc scan and do not check for media insertion and removal. Helpful when other applications already accessing discs in other drives.

--cache=size
Specifies size of read cache in megabytes used by MakeMKV. By default program uses huge amount of memory. About 128 MB is recommended for streaming and backup, 512MB for DVD conversion and 1024MB for Blu-ray conversion.

Streaming options:

--upnp=true/false
Enable or disable UPNP streaming. Default: program preferences.

--bindip=address string
Specify IP address to bind. Default: None, UPNP server binds to the first available address and web server listens on all available addresses.

--bindport=port
Specify web server port to bind. Default: 51000.

Backup options:

--decrypt
Decrypt stream files during backup. Default: no decryption.

Conversion options:

--minlength=seconds
Specify minimum title length. Default: program preferences.

Automation options.

-r , --robot
Enables automation mode. Program will output more information in a format that is easier to parse. All output is line-based and output is flushed on line end. All strings are quoted, all control characters and quotes are backlash-escaped. If you automate this program it is highly recommended to use this option. Some options make reference to apdefs.h file that can be found in MakeMKV open-source package, included with version for Linux. These values will not change in future versions.
