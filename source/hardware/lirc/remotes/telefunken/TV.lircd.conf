# model no. of remote control:             FB1320, FB1550 & VISA IR 365
# devices being controlled by this remote: SABA M5116 VT Y
#
# The IR 365 was bought as a replacement remote for a Telefunken (or was
# it Blaupunkt ?) TV. Ripped it apart several years ago, don't know its
# name.
# The other two remotes are for Telefunken VCRs and have a switch to
# control a TV. The manuals don't say which TVs and it's not
# configurable.
