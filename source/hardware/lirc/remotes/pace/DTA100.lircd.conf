# model no. of remote control: Unknown, Comcast Label
# devices being controlled by this remote: Motorola DTA100 & Pace DC50X
#
# These are a couple of the cheap digital converters being provided by
# Comcast as part of their analog shutdown. DTA100 information here:
# http://www.motorola.com/Business/US-EN/Business+Product+and+Services/TV+Video+Distribution/Customer+Premises+Equipment+%28Set-tops%29/All-Digital+QAM+Set-tops/DTA100_US-EN
#
# This remote also has power and volume buttons. You can program these
# to control your TV. But these DTAs *do* have internal volume and mute
# controls. The power button, however, is only for your TV and has no
# effect on the DTA.
#
# Because this remote use the XMP protocol, this config requires
# lirc 0.8.6 or later.
#
# Generated by starting with the generic XMP protocol configuration:
# http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/generic/XMP
# and then using irrecord to add the keys.
#
# V.2 - Added Volume Up and Volume Down
# V.3 - Confirmed operation with Pace DC50X. Changed strings to
#       conform with standard strings used in lirc 0.8.6.
