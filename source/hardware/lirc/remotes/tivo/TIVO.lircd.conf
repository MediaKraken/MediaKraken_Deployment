# brand: Original TiVo Remote (peanut)
# model no. of remote control:
# devices being controlled by this remote: MythTV
#
# The TiVo remote can be programmed to control
# the power and volume of another device, typlically
# a TV.  I had a lot of difficulty capturing the
# Vol + and Vol - key presses until I tried to
# reset the TiVo.  I could not get the remote
# reset instructions to work
# (http://customersupport.tivo.com/knowbase/root/public/tv2102.htm?)
# but a post on their website said programming it with
# the code 0981 was also a reset.  That is what I did
# before recording these codes.

# To program the TiVo remote:
# ===========================
# 1) Hold the TV Pwr and TiVo buttons together
#    until the red indicator light remains on
# 2) Enter the code:
#    0981
# The indicator light shuts off and the remote is reprogrammed.
