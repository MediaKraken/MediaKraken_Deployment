## brand: Original TiVo Remote (peanut)
## model no. of remote control: most (all?) tivo remotes should work
## devices being controlled by this remote: MythTV
##
## The TiVo remote can be programmed to control
## the power and volume of another device, typlically
## a TV.  I had a lot of difficulty capturing the
## Vol + and Vol - key presses until I tried to
## reset the TiVo.  I could not get the remote
## reset instructions to work
## (http://customersupport.tivo.com/knowbase/root/public/tv2102.htm?)
## but a post on their website said programming it with
## the code 0981 was also a reset.  That is what I did
## before recording these codes.
#
## To program the TiVo remote:
## ===========================
## 1) Hold the TV Pwr and TiVo buttons together
##    until the red indicator light remains on
## 2) Enter the code:
##    0981
## The indicator light shuts off and the remote is reprogrammed.
