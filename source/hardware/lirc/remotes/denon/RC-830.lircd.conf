# model no. of remote control: RC-830
# devices being controlled by this remote:
# Stereo / Amplifier Denon UPA-F88
# which then feeds control to
# Stereo / CD Player Denon UCD-F88
# Stereo / Cassette Deck Denon UDR-F88
# Stereo / Tuner Denon UTU-F88
#
# FWIW I looked at this because the remote stopped working.
# The remote was fixed by resoldering the dry joints on the
# crystal oscilator and replacing the LED.
