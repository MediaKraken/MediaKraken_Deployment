#
# Brand:        Foxtel STU-120 Analogue Cable Set Top Box
# Manufacturer: Pace (apparently?)
# Model:        32 button dark grey remote
#
# The initial gap of 42000 caused problems when issuing double key presses, such as "irsend SEND_ONCE foxtel 1 1"
# to change to channel 11, so it was increased to 60000 which can issue that command quickly with both presses being
# received.
#
# Hint: To make the channel number disappear from the top left immediately after the channel change, issue an Exit key
# press as well, ie: "irsend SEND_ONCE foxtel 2 5 Exit"
#
# Each of the unknown codes correspond one of the following buttons: S1, S2, Audio, Func. However, since they don't
# appear to do anything when pressed from the remote, it was hard to work out which one was which :)
