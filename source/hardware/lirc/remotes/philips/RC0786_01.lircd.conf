# filename:			 RC-5
# encoding:			 shift encoded, RC-5
# brand:             Philips (and others)
# model:             all
# supported devices: all
#
# This is the code for all RC-5 coded remote controls.
# There are 32 different systems with 64 commands each.
#
#
# Known system adresses:
# ----------------------
#	0x00		TV
#	0x02		Teletext
#	0x05		VCR1
#	0x14		CD-Player
#	0x16		Preamp
#	0x17		Receiver / Tuner
#	0x18  		Tape
#
# Not recognized are some keys on VCR remotes (e.g. Philips rt 420) to program
# the timer, cassette length and some other very special keys. Those keys seem
# not to use the RC-5 protocol. I am not sure what that is. Maybe RC-6, but I
# did not find any documentation about RC-6. If you have got a RC-6 data sheet,
# please mail me.
#
# Another thing is, that this file is way to long to be used for everyday
# usage. You should better get a custom config file for your remote control.
# This file is supposed to be for developers only.
#
# If you figure another system adress out which is not yet listed above, please
# write me a short mail which type of device, brand, etc. Just the usual infos.
