# model no. of remote control: 		 SV-1000
# devices being controlled by this remote: Sonicview FTA Receiver
#
# note: the buttons are arranged in the order they are in the manual,
#       pretty much a top to bottom, left to right fashion on the remote.
#       The * and # buttons are the blank left and right buttons near
#       the bottom of the remote.  There are 2 sat, 2 fav, and 2 epg
#       buttons on the remote, don't ask me why, I didn't design the
#       thing.
