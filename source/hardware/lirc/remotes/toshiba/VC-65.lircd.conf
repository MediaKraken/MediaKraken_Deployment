# brand:                       Toshiba
# model no. of remote control: VC-65
# devices being controlled by this remote: some (old) Toshiba VCR
#
# note: The two RECord buttons didn't produce signals, and neither did
#       the two clock mode buttons. I'm not sure if there is a certain
#       combination of buttons that need pressed before these four buttons
#       become active, or what?
