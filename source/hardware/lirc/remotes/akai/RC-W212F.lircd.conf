# brand:                       Akai
# model no. of remote control: RC-W212F
# devices being controlled by this remote: Akai VS-G37
#
# This remote is sold with the Akai VS-G37 VCR. On the front are
# keys to control the record and playback abilities of the VCR, on
# the back are keys to program future recordings, and to set up
# VCR channels and clock if need be. Only one of the sides is
# active at a given time, this is selected using the blue switch
# on the side of the remote.
#
# The remote uses a modified NEC encoding, it is unlikely you will
# be able to use it to control other devices. On the program side
# of the remote is an LCD screen, which displays various
# information, usually the current time. Future recordings can be
# set up on the remote (using the ShowView or Program keys) before
# they are beamed to the VCR with the Transmit key. Similarly, the
# time and channels can be set using the Clock_Channel key, and
# then sent to the VCR for clock synchronisation or programmed
# channels alteration.
#
# These three operations are done using a custom extension to the
# NEC encoding; the format of the bits is the same, the bytes are
# still sent by complementary pairs, but many more pairs than
# usual are sent.  For example, 18 bytes are sent to the VCR when
# the time is being set, instead of 4. Of course, these format are
# of no use to LIRC, so I have not attempted to decypher them. (I
# have looked at the data sent for time setting; it is quite
# straightforward.)
#
# Note that the "F" at the end of the remote name probably stands
# for "French", the language in which the various texts on the
# remote are written. Other language versions probably exist, and
# send the very same codes. I did not want to use French for the
# key names in this configuration file, so I tried to use the most
# sensible English equivalents.
#
# The timings and protocol information for the NEC encoding were
# obtained from http://www.ustr.net/infrared/nec.shtml
# This helped me ensure that the information below is accurate and
# can be used as a basis for other NEC-encoded remotes. I had to
# increase the eps to 60% before the remote could be read by my
# SIR dongle. The gap was measured with xmode2, and tuned to get
# better key repeats.
