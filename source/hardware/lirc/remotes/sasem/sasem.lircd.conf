# model no. of remote control: n/a
# devices being controlled by this remote:
#	This IR came with the Dign HV5 HTPC case, manufactured
#       by Uneed in Korea (www.iuneed.com).
#       AFAIK the case is called Ahanix HV5 in the US.
#       The IR/VFD device is originally manufactured by Sasem,
#       and sold as OnAir Remocon-V (?looks different from
#       mine but should be the same?)
