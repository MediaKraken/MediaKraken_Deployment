#
# NOTES:
# The ZN5015 is a cheap universal remote.  This config file is set up using code
# 838 - one of the two listed Tivo remote codes.  After trying a few codes, this
# code worked with the most buttons on the remote and gave few redundancies in
# the key codes.  Note the following:
# -To set the remote code:
# 	1. Hold down CODE SEARCH for a couple seconds until the LED stays on.
# 	2. Press one of the four source device buttons: VCR, SAT, CBL, or DVD.
# 	   (Do not choose TV - this button can only be used for TV codes.)
# 	   Note, you can set a different code for each of the source buttons.
# 	3. Type in the three digit code (8, 3, 8).  The LED should turn off if
# 	   you were successful.
# -The SHIFT key is not very friendly.  It is a pain-in-the-you-know-what.  But,
# as they say, it is best to know thy enemy.  The SHIFT key is used to activate
# the green-colored functions on several keys
# When SHIFT is pressed once, the LED turns on.  Press it again to turn SHIFT
# off.  When SHIFT is on, the code for
# the green function of the button will be output.  When SHIFT is off, the
# code for the other function on the key will be sent.  For example, when you
# press the UP / CHAN+ key, if SHIFT is on, the code for UP will be sent.  If
# SHIFT is off, the code for CHAN+ will be sent.  Make sure SHIFT is off when
# pressing buttons without a green function.  These buttons may produce no code
# or a code for a different button while SHIFT is on.
# -The following keys control the remote itself and are not meant to output IR
# codes: TV, VCR, SAT, CBL, DVD, CODE SEARCH, SLEEP, SHIFT
# -The volume up, down, and mute keys do not work with code 838.
# -The GUIDE and INFO keys produce the same output with code 838.
# -The PREV CHAN/REPEAT and ENT(er) keys produce the same output with code 838.
# -The CC (closed caption)/SUBTITLE and INPUT/TV-VCR keys produce the same
# output with code 838.
