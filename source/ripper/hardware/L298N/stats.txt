Features:
L298N as main chip, ST corporation production.
Low heat,outstanding anti-interference performance.
High working power to 46v,large current can reach 3A MAX and continue current is 2A, power to 25w.
Can drive one 2-phase stepper motor, one 4-phase stepper motor or two DC motors.
Built-in 78M05,get power from drive power,however, when drive power over 12V, please use the external 5v power as power supply.
Large capacity filter capacitance,afterflow protective diode, more stable and reliable.
